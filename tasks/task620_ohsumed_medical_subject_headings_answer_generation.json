            "input": "Abstract: As a means of providing defibrillation as soon as possible for those suffering out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, numerous communities have trained and authorized emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to provide defibrillatory shocks (EMT-D). The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death.",

            "input": "Abstract: There is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.",

In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of some tumor cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Nineteen patients with advanced head and neck cancer were entered in a Phase II trial of MGBG. MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted.",

The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave's syndrome with \"atypical\" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality.",

Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients.",

Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin. The antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-S2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle. Serotonin is a potential neurotransmitter in lower urinary tract smooth muscle, but its importance in micturition physiology and pathophysiology is unknown.",

It has been suggested that deferoxamine (DFO) may be beneficial in the treatment of aluminum-induced osteomalacia. The present studies were performed in four groups of uremic rats to determine if DFO and/or discontinuation of Al administration have an effect on bone histomorphometry and blood chemistries. The groups were: 1) uremic control 2) aluminum (0.75 to 1.0 mg/rat i.p., five times a week for twelve weeks): 3) aluminum + DFO, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats received DFO (75 mg/rat two times a week for nine weeks); 4) aluminum + time, after twelve weeks Al was discontinued and the rats were sacrificed after nine weeks. High levels of Al in serum and bone and low levels of PTH were seen in rats receiving Al. Bone histology revealed Al at the mineralization front, abnormal tetracycline uptake, and an increase in osteoid. DFO treatment did not significantly change the level of Al in bone, however both DFO treatment and discontinuation of Al reversed towards normal the above described lesions.

Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found.

In every instance there was cross-reactivity between the positive patients' sera and the heterologous non-dermatophyte antigen. Using crossed and intermediate gel immunoelectrophoresis it was found that cytoplasmic extracts of H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum showed 34 and 41 precipitin peaks respectively, most of which were shared by both organisms. No cross-reactions were observed between the non-dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts and hyperimmune animal antisera raised to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans. Exoantigens prepared from the two non-dermatophytes showed similar cross-reactivity between the two species. It appears that H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum are very similar in antigenic structure, a finding which lends support to the view that they may be closely related. They are also antigenically distinct from other pathogenic fungi which commonly infect skin, a fact which may be useful in their cultural identification as well as their recognition in tissue specimens.",

Systemic administration of strychnine (1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days at the postoperational interval of 23 days proved to be suitable for quantitating the transsynaptic degeneration at the light microscopic level. When the proximal stump of transected nerve was treated with 2% colchicine immediately after transection, 5.8 +/- 6.8 dark neurons in a single section of the medullary dorsal horn, ipsilateral to the nerve transection, were observed. Following similar treatment with 0.4% vinblastine and 0.2% vincristine, 24.4 +/- 10.5 and 9.4 +/- 7.0 dark neurons were seen, respectively. When compared with 43.0 +/- 9.4 dark neurons, which were seen in animals without alkaloid treatment, colchicine, vinblastine and vincristine significantly reduced the transsynaptic degeneration by 86, 43, and 78%, respectively. Possible mechanisms involved in prevention of transsynaptic degeneration by the alkaloids are discussed.",

Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment.",

It has been assumed, based upon previous studies, that the primary abnormality in these mice is simply lack of a necessary supportive or inductive material within the hemopoietic stroma. We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma.",

Most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections, but a large proportion of lymphocytes from WAS patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli. A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli. These morphological criteria were used to diagnose WAS from the cord blood lymphocytes of one \"at-risk\" patient. Thus, WAS is the first primary immunodeficiency in which morphological abnormalities have been identified that can aid in diagnosis.",

We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface.",

Neuraminidase-inaccessible, ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment, was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line. Neuraminidase treatment of 125I-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins (SMGs) from wt HL-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with RA- and 6TG-resistant cells. However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism. Further studies are required to determine if hyposialylation of cryptic, neuraminidase-inaccessible sites has functional significance.",

She had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels. No signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome developed, and the central regulation of secretion of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL (insulin test, diurnal rhythm) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point. We conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary (partial) cortisol insensitivity, which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion. The latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family, but had in the propositus. The results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from Cushing's disease.",

Participation in team sports in high school or college was not associated with a decreased prevalence of severe retinopathy or blindness later in life. There was, however, a suggestion of a negative association between physical activity and both cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, ie, individuals who participated in team sports were somewhat less likely to report macrovascular disease at follow-up or to have died than nonparticipants. The relationship between physical activity and diabetic complications only appeared in male subjects.

Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \"low-risk\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants.",

A total of 182 patients were included in this survey--173 males (95 per cent) and 9 females (5 per cent). The proportion of industrial burns has decreased from 31.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent of total admissions to the burns unit over the past 10 years. Fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old. The average age was 31 years. Two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent. While scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study (19.4 per cent), flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns. Face and hands were the most common sites involved. Burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns. Eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals, gas explosions and electric flash. Twenty-six patients (14 per cent) suffered respiratory injury. Only one patient out of our series of 182 died. Progress has been made in industrial safety in the past few years but carelessness and human error still take their toll.",

            "input": "Abstract: Because scald burns are reported to be the leading cause of burn injuries to children, little is written about other etiologies of burn injury in the pediatric literature. To test the hypothesis that burns from other etiologies are more serious and require longer hospitalizations than scald burns, a retrospective chart review was undertaken. The charts of all patients less than 16 years of age who were admitted to Harborview Medical Center Burn Unit in the years 1979 to 1984 were reviewed. Four hundred sixty-four children were admitted to the regional burn center during that time. We found that children under four years of age are at greatest risk for being hospitalized for thermal injury, that the burn most commonly occurs inside the home between 6 PM and midnight, and that scalds are the most common etiology for thermal injuries in children (54%). However, 46% of the burns resulting in admission to our burn center were from etiologies other than scald injury. There was no significant correlation between etiology of the burns and length of hospital stay, rate of infection, or need for excision and grafting. Thermal injuries to children from any etiology are serious; pediatric health care providers should be aware that children may be burned in a variety of ways and should direct some of their well-child visit time to the topic of burn prevention in the home.",

Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range.

Campylobacter jejuni infection was recognized in all the ill students and caused asymptomatic infections in three others. In total, 22 (88%) of 25 students who consumed raw milk for the first time became infected as compared with none of two who had not consumed raw milk. Among ten persons who chronically consumed raw milk, none was ill, a striking difference from the 76% attack rate among the 25 acutely exposed students. The quantity of raw milk consumed was directly related to the occurrence and severity of illness. Acutely infected students showed significant rises in C jejuni-specific immunoglobulins, whereas the low antibody levels seen in unexposed persons did not rise. In contrast, acute-phase serum samples from persons with chronic exposure to raw milk showed elevated antibody levels to C jejuni. These findings indicate that chronic raw milk consumption is associated with elevated levels of C jejuni-specific serum antibodies and with immunity to symptomatic infection.",

We studied seatbelt use among drivers and front seat passengers involved in motor vehicle accidents for a 3-month period pre-legislation (Phase 1), and a 5-month period post-legislation (Phase 2), to determine if this type of compulsory law, providing civil fines of $50 for violators, changes seatbelt use behavior. The reported use rate among drivers rose from 21% pre-legislation to 47% post-legislation (p less than 0.01). The use rate among front seat passengers rose from 21% to 40% (not significantly different due to the small number of occupants recorded in this position). A highway survey (Phase 3) noted the use rate in New York City and surrounding counties to be 63%, a marked increase from the published pre-legislation value of 16%. We conclude that mandatory seatbelt use legislation is effective in significantly increasing seatbelt use and urge physicians to seek similar legislation in every state.",

The median time from initial therapy to development of secondary leukemia or MDS was 71 months (range, 7 to 331 months). The initial malignancy was hematologic in 43%. An MDS presentation occurred in 57 patients (51%), 55% of whom subsequently transformed to acute leukemia. Chromosomal abnormalities were documented in marrow specimens from 70 of 89 patients with analyzable metaphases (79%; 69% of the total group). Compared with 34 patients with metachronous secondary leukemia without prior chemotherapy or irradiation, those with therapy-related leukemia exhibited a significantly higher frequency of abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 (43% v 18%), and lower incidence of diploid karyotypes (18% v 50%). Chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were also significantly higher in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, procarbazine, and nitrosoureas (72% to 83%), compared with those who had received cyclophosphamide-based regimens (29%), other chemotherapies (14%), or irradiation alone (29%). The median overall survival from diagnosis of the secondary leukemia or MDS was 30 weeks. Survival was significantly shorter for patients with acute leukemia compared with MDS presentation (21 v 45 weeks); in the latter category, it was similar whether evolution to acute leukemia occurred or not. Of 72 patients treated with antileukemia therapy, 29% achieved complete remission (CR). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated the cytogenetic pattern to be the most important characteristic determining remission rate and survival. Other important prognostic features were the morphologic presentation (MDS v acute leukemia) for probability of achieving remission, and patient age and marrow blasts percentage for survival.",

These infants did not differ from the older children (1-20 years of age) in male/female ratio, clinical grouping, or survival rates. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma.",

This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis.",

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.",

Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.",

            "input": "Abstract: RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.",

Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power.",

Single-vessel disease was present in 64% of the patients and multivessel disease in 36%. The preceding myocardial infarction had been small to moderate in size in the majority of the patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction was more than 50% in 80% of the patients. Forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion. Angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction (average 12 +/- 7 days after infarction). The initial success rate was 89% (47/53). The success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower (29/35, 83%) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days (18/18, 100%) but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .06). There were no deaths related to the procedure. In four of the six failures, emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8% (4/53). At 6 months follow-up 26% (14/53) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina, which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery, or medical therapy. There were no late deaths. Late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients. Thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11% (6/53 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established.",

Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement.",

We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites.",

The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury.",

            "input": "Abstract: Radiographic techniques used to quantify coronary blood flow all require bolus injection of contrast material, which markedly alters the flow being measured. Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "input": "Abstract: Over the last two decades, emergency medical services in the United States have been greatly improved. Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.",

The predominant mechanism is increased negative intrathoracic pressure, although hypoxia and cardiac and neurologic factors may contribute. Laryngospasm associated with intubation and general anesthesia is a common cause of pulmonary edema in children. However, only seven cases of pulmonary edema presumably due to laryngospasm have been reported in adolescents and adults. Five of the seven had other risk factors for upper airway obstruction, and in four, the diagnosis of \"laryngospasm\" could be explained by other factors. Patients with underlying risk factors for upper airway obstruction, such as a forme fruste of sleep apnea or nasopharyngeal abnormalities, appear to be at increased risk for the development of pulmonary edema in the setting of intubation and anesthesia. This form of pulmonary edema usually resolves rapidly without the need for aggressive therapy or invasive monitoring.",

Recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting a need to change the present American Heart Association standards for artificial ventilation. These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway.",

To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity.",

The THA was revised 13 years after implantation. Thirty millimeters of calcar resorption was noted radiographically. Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.",

Right atrial pressure and other hemodynamic variables including right ventricular stroke work index were also measured before and after the pericardium was widely opened. The pericardium was grossly normal in all patients and only small physiologic effusions were present. In Group I mean pericardial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg as was mean right atrial pressure. In Group II mean pericardial pressure was 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus mean right atrial pressure of 10 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Excluding 2 of the 20 patients with outlying data, pericardial pressure showed linear correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 0.689). In Group I right ventricular stroke work index rose from 5.0 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 2.1 g-m/m2 (p less than 0.01) after pericardiotomy with no significant increase in mean right atrial pressure; similar findings in Group II were consistent with removal of external constraint. Thus, even in the absence of an abnormal effusion the normal pericardium exerts a significant pressure on the heart, which is often similar in magnitude to right atrial pressure. In certain notable exceptions, however, right atrial pressure far exceeds pericardial pressure. Such pericardial constraint has important implications for ventricular diastolic mechanics.",

All underwent extensive neurodevelopmental and educational testing. Additional information was obtained from school and parent questionnaires and interviews. Children were not placed on medication unless they demonstrated characteristic impulsive, inattentive, and/or overactive behavior in two of three environments (home, school, clinic). Fifty-two children (80%) were not placed on medication. Follow-up was completed in 80 percent, and 93 percent of these children were doing well with nonpharmacologic interventions. Initial comparison of children not placed and placed on medication revealed that age, race, SES, amount of resource help and retention could not distinguish groups. Children placed on medication had difficulties earlier in school (chi 2 = 4.88, p less than 0.05), weren't as delayed academically (chi 2 = 6.30, p less than 0.05) and had less neurodevelopmental disorders (chi 2 = 9.01, p less than 0.01). If a careful psychosocial history does not reveal impulsive, inattentive, and/or hyperactive behavior outside of school, a child should be evaluated to rule out neurodevelopmental and educational problems.",

Eight hypertensive patients and seven normotensive volunteer subjects were studied. Inulin and para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearances, natriuresis, and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly after intravenous dosing with dopamine (2 micrograms/min/kg) in both groups. These increases were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects: 31.8% +/- 3.7% vs. 16.2% +/- 1.2% for inulin clearance (P less than 0.01), 83.3% +/- 10.5% vs. 41.1% +/- 3.4% for PAH clearance (P less than 0.01), and 331% +/- 38% vs. 216% +/- 26% for natriuresis (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest hyperresponsiveness to dopamine during hypertension. This enhanced response to exogenous dopamine can be considered as a further argument favoring the existence of a deficit in dopaminergic activity during hypertension. Dopamine also induced a significant reduction in blood pressure and increased heart rate in hypertensive subjects but no significant change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in normotensive subjects.",

The mean apparent first-order elimination t1/2 for amrinone in the slow acetylators was 4.4 hours, whereas it was 2.0 hours in the fast acetylators (P less than 0.05). There was little difference in the volume of distribution at steady state. Clearance was lower in the slow acetylators, 16.6 L/hr, than in the fast acetylators, 37.2 L/hr (P less than 0.05). The AUC was higher for the slow acetylators, 4.96 micrograms X hr X ml-1, than for the fast acetylators, 2.20 micrograms X hr X ml-1 (P less than 0.01). Concentrations of amrinone and its N-acetyl metabolite in the urine from each volunteer were determined.

These high transport rates did not increase further, however, when SNGFR went to 51.2 +/- 0.7 or 50.7 +/- 0.6 nl/min after atrial natriuretic factor or glucagon administration. Anion and water transport rates in the late PCT were lower and exhibited less flow dependence. During chronic metabolic alkalosis, acidification was inhibited in the late but not early PCT. In conclusion, the early PCT is distinguished from the late PCT by having high-capacity, flow-responsive but saturable, anion- and water-reabsorptive processes relatively unaffected by alkalemia.",

Knowledge of the side-effect spectrum of the various classes of antipsychotic drugs is necessary for the clinician to arrive at a rational choice of medication.

The following basic principles of clinical psychopharmacology should be followed: Consider risk and benefits; clinical experience is prerequisite; establish the diagnosis; select the appropriate class of psychotropic drug for the primary diagnosis; within drug class, the drugs are usually equally effective for patients with the diagnosis; give a dose that is high enough to be effective; choose target symptoms that can be monitored to indicate when to stop or increase the drug; avoid use of multiple drugs when possible; drugs are only one element in a comprehensive treatment strategy. Other modalities need equally careful consideration, e.g., psychotherapy, group therapy, family treatment, and vocational rehabilitation; and consultation with other subspecialists should be sought readily when indicated.",

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from the esterified fatty acids of these lipid classes and analyzed to ascertain the proportions of methyl linoleate (18:2 delta 9,12), methyl sebaleate (18:2 delta 5,8), and methyl sapienate (16:1 delta 6). On the same subjects, 2 measures of sebum secretion rate were obtained, namely the sustainable wax ester secretion rate (WESR) on the forehead and the ratio of wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters) [WE/(CH + CE)] in the surface lipid. The proportions of methyl linoleate in FAME from the wax esters decreased, and the proportions of methyl sebaleate increased, with increased rates of sebum secretion. For both methyl linoleate and methyl sebaleate, a better correlation was obtained when the ratio of WE/(CH + CE) was used as a measure of sebum secretion rather than the WESR. The proportions of methyl linoleate in the FAME from the acylceramides were also inversely related to ratios of WE/(CH + CE). In acylceramides, linoleate was replaced by sapienate, a major fatty acid of human sebum. It appears, therefore, that sebum fatty acid composition may change with changes in sebaceous gland activity, and that sebum fatty acids can enter the epidermis and be incorporated into epidermal lipids.",

The low prevalence of cobalt and nickel sensitivity from cement was probably related to the low concentration of soluble cobalt and nickel salts in the cement.

Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport.",

Fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied. Of these, 23 patients were known diabetics, and 28 were not diabetic. The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl. These results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of D-50.",

However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W). The human preclinical testing of System 8 will start in 1988.",

The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane.",

Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.",

            "input": "Abstract: The effects of atracurium and alcuronium on the evoked mechanical and electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis were investigated in 30 adult patients. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz at intervals of 20 s. The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade. During onset of blockade by alcuronium, the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ECAP. This difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine. The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group. These findings suggest that the differences between mechanical and electromyographic measurements of neuromuscular blockade are drug-specific and are more pronounced during the onset of blockade than during its antagonism by neostigmine.",

The antagonists were administered 5 min after total ablation of the twitch response and the end-point of recovery was a train-of-four ratio of 70%. In 30 patients given vecuronium the mean time to reach this point (duration TOF70) was 66.7 min in the control group (no antagonist), 43.5 min in the group given neostigmine and 59.8 min in the group given edrophonium. The duration TOF70 was shorter in the neostigmine group than in the control (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01) groups. The duration TOF70 did not differ from control in the edrophonium group. In 29 patients given atracurium, the durations TOF70 were 66.4, 44.1 and 54.9 min in the control, neostigmine and edrophonium groups, respectively. The durations TOF70 in the neostigmine (P less than 0.01) and edrophonium (P less than 0.01), groups were shorter than control. The duration TOF70 of the neostigmine group was shorter than in the edrophonium group (P less than 0.01). These results show that profound neuromuscular blockade cannot be rapidly antagonized by either of these two agents, but if reversal is required under these circumstances, neostigmine would be the more effective drug.",

A further nine patients not given an anticholinesterase acted as a control group. In two groups (six patients for each anticholinesterase) in whom antagonism was attempted at 95-98% blockade of the tetanic response, recovery of the tetanic response after two or three doses of edrophonium 0.75 mg kg-1 i.v. was not statistically different from that in the control group; recovery after two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg i.v. was significantly faster (P less than 0.001). Recovery of the single twitch response after antagonism with edrophonium, although longer than that with neostigmine (P less than 0.01), was significantly shorter than in the control group (P less than 0.05). When edrophonium is given at the commencement of recovery, the initial rapid antagonism of tetanic block is not sustained, whereas antagonism by neostigmine is more persistent and the recovery phase is significantly shortened. In a further two groups of patients (n = 5) given atracurium 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v., antagonism was not attempted until the peak height of the tetanic contraction had reached approximately 50% of the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Ten patients each received vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 or tubocurarine 0.5 mg kg-1. Neuromuscular blockade was calculated as the percent depression of the first twitch, and was determined at the time of reappearance of the second, third and fourth twitches of the train-of-four. The pattern during recovery from blockade induced by the three neuromuscular blocking agents was similar, with T2, T3 and T4 reappearing at approximately 93%, 89% and 86% residual blockade, respectively.

When indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation, UVR (ultraviolet radiation) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous. Suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation, showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period. The degree of suppression at any time, however, was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation, indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage. Construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to UVB and UVC radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths.",

Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.",

            "input": "Abstract: Epinephrine causes platelet aggregation and secretion by interacting with alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \"desensitization\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.",

The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.",

Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA.",

These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.",

Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits.",

Limb preference and efficiency were evaluated, as well as the relationship between limb use, spontaneous, and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias, both preoperatively and postoperatively. To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively. The similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems.",

Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. Forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age, education, IQ, and sex. All patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease. Neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence, psychomotor skills, memory, visuospatial and executive functions. No global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group. Moreover, memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact. A small cluster of deficits emerged, interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning. In addition, several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body. Deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including IQ and age, both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks. Results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. As the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning, the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported.",

After the intravenous administration of a moderate dose (4 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats, the transport of slow component a (SCa) was found to be retarded, transport velocity being decreased by 17% (0.85 +/- 0.06 mm/day vs 1.03 +/- 0.06 mm/day in controls). The transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components (aFC and rFC) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg, although the relative amount of aFC was decreased by 27% (3.2 +/- 0.9% vs 4.4 +/- 1.1% in controls).

            "input": "Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.",

In this longitudinal study, involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively, we have confirmed that fluctuations in T8+ cells occur in patients with MS and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients' spouses but not their siblings, compared with unrelated controls. The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage. Our results provide indirect evidence for the role of environmental factors in determining certain immunological abnormalities present in patients with MS and illustrate the role of family studies in determining the specificity of these changes to the disease.",

There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury.",

Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.",

The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.",

In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.",

Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years.

The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer.",

These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread.",

The current investigation determined the TSA, LASA, total protein (TP), and TSA/TP values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic disease, 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases (pathologic controls), and 42 normal individuals. Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.",

The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects.",

Two patients had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. In the third case, the histologic features of the brain metastases were consistent with a neuron-specific enolase-positive, small cell anaplastic carcinoma. Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, available in two cases, were normal. The only diagnostic investigation was contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning.",

Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory.",

Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.",

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.",

Twenty-six of these patients had received 2000 rad within the week preceding surgery, and nine patients had received no preoperative treatment. The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases. Of the TCCs classified as papillary in the biopsy specimens and irradiated, 79% lacked a papillary component at cystectomy, but in no case was the invasive component eliminated or regression from muscle invasion to superficial TCC noticed. Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy. In addition, irradiation induced squamous differentiation in neoplastic cells only, without affecting the nonneoplastic urothelium.",

Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.",

Black boys had significantly higher levels of estradiol, HDL cholesterol, and apo A-I, and lower levels of androstenedione and VLDL cholesterol than white boys, independent of age and adiposity. Age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione, and moderately with DHEA-S and estradiol levels in both races. However, only in white boys was age consistently related to VLDL cholesterol (positively), HDL cholesterol (negatively), and apo A-I (negatively). Overall, testosterone was associated inversely with HDL cholesterol and apo A-I in white boys, while progesterone was related positively to apo A-I in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity. However, these relationships were found to differ with age. Partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race. A significant positive relation of testosterone to VLDL cholesterol, and inverse relations of testosterone to HDL cholesterol and apo A-I and DHEA-S to HDL cholesterol were apparent only in white boys in the 13 to 14 year age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

All pacing results were positive (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment shift) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients, whereas some or all were negative in seven. Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%).

It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm.",

Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.",

Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.",

            "input": "Abstract: Combined two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography has a high sensitivity and specificity for detection of isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects. However, muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5.6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects, 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects, and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects, the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72% and that of two-dimensional/Doppler was 38% (100% specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects.",

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema.",

            "input": "Abstract: Body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex. Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias.",

            "input": "Abstract: The short-term effects of incremental doses of procainamide (7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mg/kg) on right ventricular effective refractory period, intraventricular conduction, and induction of ventricular tachycardia were determined in 31 patients who had a history of sustained, unimorphic ventricular tachycardia. QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia.",

To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered \"complicated\" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA.",

Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis, and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 vs 1170 U/liter in control patients, p = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% vs 43% in control patients, p = .0001). Three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (6% vs 14% in the control group, p = .006). With the use of multivariate regression analysis, infarct size limitation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the ST segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms to admission, and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of less than 1.2 mV who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms.",

Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed. A study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs. Vest CPR was compared with manual CPR with either conventional (300 newtons) or high (430 newtons) sternal force. After induction of ventricular fibrillation, each technique was performed for 26 min. Defibrillation was then performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \"patchiness,\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.",

Twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 10 dogs (group I) the LAD remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 (group II) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Gd-DTPA (0.34 mM/kg) was administered to five dogs in group I at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group II 5 min after reperfusion. At 3 hr after ligation, the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 Tesla magnetic resonance imager. Reperfused hearts given Gd-DTPA demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given Gd-DTPA. This enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images. Studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with Gd-DTPA in gated spin echo images. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction.",

The event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment, and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child. Data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and EMT education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate. Forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training. Data suggest that EMS providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively. The Los Angeles EMS System for children is described. There are two levels of receiving facilities: Emergency Departments Approved for Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care Centers. The system is voluntary and has 85% of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines. Early recognition of the prearrest state, improved training, and equipping of prehospital care personnel, development of EMS services for children, dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course, as well as research in pediatric CPR may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population.",

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs.",

To overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement, better education strategies are needed. Adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement. Due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning CPR, methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement. Teaching two-rescuer CPR to lay rescuers should not routinely be done. Most adults, particularly those around high-risk individuals, should learn one-rescuer CPR. Infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children. Methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis. Whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement, thereby maximizing learning. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be widely taught to health professionals. ACLS instruction needs to be spread over time, whenever logistically possible, to enhance learning and retention. Good, validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated. Better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio.",

            "input": "Abstract: The ability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to provide adequate vital organ blood flow during prolonged resuscitation has long been questioned, as has the mechanism of blood flow during CPR. Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure \"thoracic pump\" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder. The latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation. Preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful.",

This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage.",

Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected.",

Defibrillation was attempted 2 min after the administration of bicarbonate or placebo. All animals were successfully defibrillated, but three of eight bicarbonate-treated and two of eight control animals died in electromechanical dissociation (p = NS). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred in three animals in each group (p = NS). Successful resuscitation was not dependent on treatment, arterial or mixed venous Pco2, or arterial or mixed venous pH but correlated strongly with coronary perfusion pressure (p less than .003). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred without relation to any identifiable variable. The gradient between diastolic aortic and right atrial pressures was 24 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg in treated animals over the entire 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = NS). However, among animals successfully resuscitated, mean diastolic coronary perfusion pressure averaged 27 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 20 +/- 1 mm Hg among those dying in electromechanical dissociation (p less than .02). For the final 2 min of resuscitation, after drug administration, these gradients were 31 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively (p less than .01). Microsphere determined myocardial perfusion correlated with the diastolic aortic-right atrial perfusion pressure gradient (r = .86) and was 0.43 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in survivors and 0.22 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g in nonsurvivors (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma.

The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years.

We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition.",

Twenty out of twenty healthy subjects had abundant triamterene crystals and casts in acid urine after receiving a single 100 mg dose. Casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic. Cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate. Animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney. These findings provide a possible explanation for the reported nephrotoxicity of triamterene, particularly when given to patients who are receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.",

The antithrombin III-concentration increased to 0.56 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, reaching 1.87% of normal plasma values. The antithrombin III-portion of total protein was 0.62% in plasma and 0.79% in dialysate. The fibrinopeptide A-concentration, a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml in plasma (normal range: less than 2.5 ng/ml) and 153.4 +/- 16.8 ng/ml in dialysate during regular CAPD. After the addition of 5000 U heparin the fibrinopeptide A-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. In vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin III in dialysate. We suggest that the fibrinopeptide A is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin III-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin.",

Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls.

Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained.

Excellent or good results were noted in 15 of 18 quadriceps and 7 of 10 patellar tendons. Radiographic comparison with the opposite knee disclosed incongruences between the patella and the femoral groove in the tangential view and/or cranial-caudal position of the patella in the lateral view in 13 of the quadriceps tendon ruptures and seven of the patellar tendon ruptures. Patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic, incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms. There was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement. Nevertheless, exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation. Reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture. In acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient.",

Two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated (r = 0.85) with femoral growth rate. This was significant at the p = 0.01 level. Girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys.

Ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws. The hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position. Sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation. Blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed. Antegrade Ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques. Decreased operative time, less blood loss, less technical difficulty, and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient. Femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction, circlerage to ensure stability, and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation. This mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases.",

This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.",

The calcaneus splits into a small anteromedial and a larger posterolateral fragment. Rupture of the lateral collateral ligament allows the posterolateral calcaneal fragment to move laterally to lie immediately subjacent to the distal fibula. Closed reduction is impossible. Open reduction of this rare fracture dislocation is essential. A lateral approach to the calcaneus is generally sufficient, but a second medial incision may be required.",

One technical problem occurred when large osteophytes blocked access to the facet joints. Otherwise, there were no complications and minimal morbidity. Most patients (15 of 20; 75%) had an initial response, but a much smaller number (six of 18 followed more than three months; 33%) had a lasting response. Repeat injections, when done, always led to temporary improvement but rarely to lasting relief (one of five; 20%). Three factors characterized the patients: a negative screening examination for other causes of back pain or sciatica; back pain with tenderness localized over one or more facet joints; and radiologic changes of degenerative joint disease within the facet joints. Facet joint disease may be a significant cause of low back pain. The above three criteria are useful in clinical identification of patients with this problem. Facet joint injections play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.",

Both specimens contained viable cells with patches of degenerative cells. There was a loss of disc height in the chymopapain-treated disc, but no improvement of symptoms. These results illustrated that even in well-circumscribed cases with documented disc protrusion into the spinal canal, the disc space narrowing following injection may aggravate the symptoms of nerve root entrapment, especially if a low-grade lateral recess stenosis is associated with the disc protrusion. The persistence or aggravation of symptoms probably is related to these anatomic considerations.

Group I included 17 fractures, of which nine (53%) had delayed union, malunion, or nonunion. The average time to union was 6.5 months. Seven patients had pressure sores and pulmonary emboli. Eleven fractures were noted in Group II. One delayed union (9%), one superficial wound infection that healed uneventfully, and one deep vein thrombosis were noted. The average time to union was 12 weeks. All six Group III tibias had delayed and nonunions, regardless of treatment. Nonoperative fractures healed at a prolonged rate, while open reduction and internal fixation enhanced the rate and time to union. Fractures treated with early open reduction and internal fixation, excluding Group III patients, had the least orthopedic and medical complications. Open reduction and internal fixation is a justifiable alternative to nonoperative treatment in the uncomplicated tibia fracture regardless of neurologic lesion for improved medical and fracture care.",

In the second group of 32 patients, the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary. Fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done. After a two-year follow-up examination, there were two failures and five complications. A third group of nine patients was treated with Ferguson's modification of Maquet's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision; two of the nine had complications, subsequently treated successfully by converting Ferguson's operation into the Maquet operation, as modified for Group II. The modified Maquet procedure can be an effective and reliable treatment of patellofemoral arthrosis with a relatively low incidence of complications.",

The mineralized tissue developed within clusters of giant fat cells in the spaces between the cells. Investigations with light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in these sites there was some differentiation of the fibroblastic cells in an osteogenic direction, shown by changes to more polygonal shapes, and the synthesis of well-banded collagen similar to that found in bone tissue. Differentiation may be due, in part, to increased cell density in a confined space. Growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite. Initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies, lipid, and products of cellular degeneration. Once initiated, mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures, suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization.",

A stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current BMU theory. Each of 100 trabecular \"thicknesses\" was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator. Each day, each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1:900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle. Resorption (active, 12 days; reversal phase, 27 days) was followed by formation (94 +/- 35 days) and resulted in BMU balance when resorption depth was 36.8 +/- 9.2 micron. Fenestration (thickness less than 0) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula. The original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost. This was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken, perhaps due to higher mechanical loading. Over 20 years, 14% of trabeculae were lost when the BMU balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged. About one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae, and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces. A 10% fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7% loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron, compatible with Courpron's data. Simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss, approximately 50% of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new BMUs with unchanged bone formation rate, all three followed by complete recovery of BMU balance after only two years. In each case, mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery. Prolonged osteoblast life span was the most likely explanation for the increased mean trabecular thicknesses and trabecular bone volumes seen in patients with osteoporosis, when treated with sodium fluoride plus calcium supplements or daily injections of parathyroid peptide hPTH 1-34.",

The initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena. One of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone. Progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone. In such situations, transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue. The most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms. The health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed. In certain models of osteoarthrosis, alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions. Stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation, which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load.",

Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved.

There was no effect of either agent on the incidence of osteophytes in this model.

However, neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in OA nor the effects of chronic administration of NSAIDs on the natural history of OA in humans is known. Recent studies indicate that several NSAIDs, including salicylates, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro. The effect on OA cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage. Other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo, aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself. However, no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo. In damaged cartilage the magnitude of NSAID-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue. In addition, the NSAIDs used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due, in part, to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid.",

A questionnaire study was conducted to determine the long-term outcome in 31 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic recurrent chest pain after an average 4.1-year follow-up period. Although 45 percent reported having had persistent symptoms, chest pain had disappeared in 81 percent of those followed more than 3 years. Equally reassuring is the fact that in no case did occult disease subsequently appear to account for the initial symptoms. This study supports the current clinical approach of limited diagnostic evaluation and reassurance in the management of these patients.",

Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively. In combinations, buspirone added to the effects of diazepam in Maddox wing and letter cancellation but tended to counteract diazepam effects on divided attention and learning acquisition. Subjectively buspirone prolonged diazepam-induced sedation. Increased calmness caused by diazepam was not affected by concomitant buspirone. It is suggested that combining small doses of buspirone to diazepam does not cause any additional decrement in psychomotor performance. Possible advantages of the diazepam-buspirone combination in therapeutic use are discussed.",

Fifty-six healthy male subjects were given either placebo or three equal daily doses of SQ 28,668 ranging from 25 to 1200 mg. Plasma drug concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of the plasma drug concentration-time curve was consistent with enterohepatic recirculation. The effects of SQ 28,668 on ex vivo platelet aggregation suggested that SQ 28,668 is a specific competitive antagonist of thromboxane A2 with a platelet receptor dissociation constant (estimated by Schild analysis) of about 19 nmol/L. Approximately 94% occupation of thromboxane receptors by SQ 28,668 was required to produce a small but measurable increase of the template bleeding time. Dose-ranging studies of antithrombotic drugs are difficult and expensive. For this reason, a method was developed that allows estimation of the dose of a thromboxane receptor antagonist that would be expected to be therapeutically equivalent to a given dose of aspirin.",

To determine whether pinacidil's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject's debrisoquin phenotype, eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied. Seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin, whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the N-oxide was altered by the subjects' debrisoquin phenotype. Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01). Less pinacidil was metabolized to the N-oxide metabolite in the patients with cirrhosis than in the normal individuals. Thus pinacidil's metabolism and clearance are reduced in patients with cirrhosis but are independent of debrisoquin phenotype.",

During a 12-month period, nitrendipine was used as monotherapy in 30 patients and in combination with propranolol or a diuretic in an additional 28 patients. Nitrendipine monotherapy lowered supine blood pressure from 148/97 to 136/83 mm Hg, but LV mass did not change significantly. Supine blood pressure decreased from 155/103 to 134/86 mm Hg in patients receiving combination therapy but, again, changes in LV mass were not significant.

Over the past 8 years, it has been planted extensively in Australia and is now being exported to the United States and other Western countries. Recently, an explosion in incidence of contact dermatitis due to this plant has been seen. 24 patients who were suspected of being sensitive to it were patch tested to fresh plant and extracts with confirmation of sensitivity. A cross sensitivity to Toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing. The allergen in Toxicodendron, 3 pentadecylcatechol, is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol, present in Grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in Grevillea robusta. Patch testing in patients sensitive to Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions, thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' allergy. There is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the Grevillea genus, e.g., Grevillea robusta. With the spread of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' to other markets, this problem will become increasingly common.",

After 3 applications daily for 3 days, 2% SLS aqueous solutions gave a naked eye assessment, increase in epidermal thickness and total dermal inflammatory cell response, which was greater than for a 1% SLS solution. The dermal inflammatory cell response was mainly mononuclear (lymphocytic) in nature. With the SLS reactions as control, various organic solvents were studied and ranked against the SLS reactions and internally. Trichlorethylene was the most irritant solvent, ranking as high as 2% SLS. Other chlorinated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons tested caused irritant reactions. The alcohols and acetone gave no reaction. White spirit was as irritant as trichlorethylene. Thinners were less irritant, around the level of the 1% SLS control reaction. The 4-day experimental design is a convenient and suitable animal model for screening irritant potential, and provides information relevant to the pathogenesis of irritant contact reactions.",

A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing.",

In this study, the relationship between conjunctival oxygen tension (PcjO2) and standard cardiorespiratory variables was examined during a sequential resuscitation protocol after acute hemorrhage. Anesthetized dogs were rapidly bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg and then retransfused with the shed blood in a stepwise fashion. PcjO2 fell to 2% of control values after hemorrhage and did not return to prehemorrhage values until more than 90% of the shed blood had been reinfused. PcjO2 was among the last set of cardiorespiratory variables to return to control values during resuscitation and was the last noninvasive variable to normalize. The ratio of PcjO2 to arterial oxygen tension decreased from a prehemorrhage value of 0.76 +/- 0.05 (SEM) to 0.02 +/- 0.003 after hemorrhage, and did not increase to values greater than 0.50 until resuscitation was more than 90% complete.

Both the minimum and mean values for the distance between the inner electrodes, and a variety of values for the resistivity of blood (rho) were substituted in the Kubicek's empiric formula for calculating cardiac output by transthoracic electrical impedance. Using the mean distance between the inner electrodes and a rho-value of 150 ohm X cm gave the best agreement between the methods (mean difference 0.17 +/- 2.4 L/min). Ventilation alone or with positive end-expiratory pressure did not significantly affect the bias of the estimate, but both affected its precision when compared with measurements in spontaneously breathing patients (SD of mean difference 2.4 and 3.2 L/min, respectively, vs. 1.5 L/min). The pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly higher in patients with an abnormal diastolic impedance waveform (zero-wave), but there was no relationship between wedge pressure and base impedance per unit length between the measuring electrodes.",

Whether these larger doses of dopamine also reduce urine output in newborns is not known. Therefore, we determined the effects of administering high-dose dopamine (more than 20 micrograms/kg X min) on the urine output of 15 newborn infants. Five infants were studied prospectively and ten retrospectively. In the prospective study, urine output was determined as the dose of dopamine was increased; in the retrospective study, urine output was determined as the infants were being weaned from high doses of dopamine. Both data sets demonstrate that administering high-dosage dopamine does not reduce the urine output of sick newborn infants. Therefore, we conclude that doses of dopamine previously reported to decrease urine output in adults do not do so in sick newborn infants. Consequently, when necessary, high doses of dopamine may be used in sick newborn infants to achieve cardiovascular stability without reducing urine output.",

Thirty-two neonates with respiratory distress were alternately enrolled in an experimental group (results of PtcO2 and PtcCO2 available for clinical management) and a control group (results of only PtcO2 available). Although differences were not significant, infants in the experimental group had more changes in the intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) settings during transport, and more such infants arrived at the receiving hospital with acceptable pH and PCO2 values. On arrival at the receiving hospital, two patients in the control group had acidosis and hypercarbia and were placed on IMV immediately on arrival. No such patients were encountered in the experimental group. For patients needing IMV during transport, the percentage of study time spent with PtcCO2 measurements in the normal range (35 to 45 torr) was greater for the experimental group (p less than .02). Continuous PtcCO2 monitoring during transport offers the opportunity to further decrease the risks of transporting a critically ill neonate.",

In the first four patients, CAVH was used in conjunction with either peritoneal or hemodialysis. In the fifth patient, CAVH was the sole renal replacement therapy employed; in this critically ill anuric infant, we were best able to evaluate the ability of CAVH to continuously control fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, and allow the administration of adequate parenteral nutrition. The difficulties encountered were related to anticoagulation, establishment of adequate vascular access, and selection of an appropriate hemofilter for the performance of the technique. Despite the application of suction-assistance, we were unable to effectively employ a prototype pediatric hemofilter to attain a level of plasma ultrafiltration consistent with the objectives of therapy. However, we were able to effectively and safely employ an adult hemofilter for these purposes; modifications were made in the adult hemofilter system before its application in the smallest pediatric patients. Our experience suggests that, even in critically ill infants, CAVH can be successfully applied as an effective renal replacement therapy. However, further experience is required before its potential impact on patient survival can be assessed.",

Techniques of insertion were vigorously supervised. Central and peripheral catheters were cared for by identical protocols. Overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters (353/1,024) than with centrally inserted central catheters (18/713), even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days. Pneumothorax occurred in seven out of 713 patients with centrally inserted central catheterization, one with hemothorax and two with pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tubes. Five were treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration. Three patients out of 1,496 with peripheral or peripherally inserted central catheters required phlebectomy for suppurative thrombophlebitis. We concluded that overall morbidity in critically ill patients is lower from centrally inserted central catheters than peripheral intravenous catheters, with peripherally inserted central catheters in an intermediate position. Supervision of techniques of insertion has to be kept at a high level to keep complications of central catheterization at an acceptable level. Peripheral catheter sites would be better maintained with more frequent replacement of the catheter.",

Subjective sensations of dyspnea at rest and during guarded exercise, as well as subjective feelings of calmness or anxiety were also recorded. There was no difference in mechanical lung function, but the PO2 tended to decrease and PCO2 to increase after alprazolam administration. The maximum exercise level attained and the distance covered in the 12 minute walk was unchanged.

Thus, hepatic elimination of drugs with a high hepatic-extraction ratio, which was linked to alteration in hepatic blood flow, could be reduced during mechanical ventilation. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of mechanical ventilation on pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine, which is a well-known nonrestrictive elimination drug at the hepatic level. Five patients (mean age, 58 years) with normal hepatic function and quite similar gasometric parameters before and after weaning from mechanical ventilation were studied. With a washout period of 48 hours between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous ventilation, each patient was submitted to the following protocol: lidocaine in a bolus (1.5 mg/kg intravenously), followed by infusion (1.0 to 1.7 mg/min for 120 minutes). The results were that the peak plasma concentration after the bolus during mechanical ventilation was 3.22 +/- 0.37 mg/L (mean +/- SE) vs 2.40 +/- 0.35 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.02). Steady-state plasma concentration during mechanical ventilation was 2.10 +/- 0.20 mg/L vs 1.64 +/- 0.16 mg/L during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Total clearance was 604.2 +/- 87.0 ml/min during mechanical ventilation vs 775.0 +/- 112.1 ml/min during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.01). Elimination half-life was 245.2 +/- 50.6 minutes during mechanical ventilation vs 160.0 +/- 40.6 minutes during spontaneous ventilation (p less than 0.05). Distribution volume was 188.6 +/- 50.2 L during mechanical ventilation and 183.0 +/- 50.8 L during spontaneous ventilation (not significant). These preliminary data clearly demonstrated a decrease in lidocaine elimination in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of dosage adjustment of such a highly hepatic-extracted drug in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation remains to be investigated.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures. We measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves, and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers (30 men and 30 women) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years. We found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio (mean +/- SD) was 0.72 +/- 0.19 in men and 0.77 +/- 0.18 in women. The coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women. The 95 percent confidence limits for the mid-vital capacity flow ratio were 0.65 to 0.79 for men and 0.70 to 0.84 for women. Maximum inspiratory pressures (mean +/- SD) were 129 +/- 30 cm H2O in men and 91 +/- 16 cm H2O in women, not significantly different from previous studies. Normalizing maximum inspiratory flow for maximum inspiratory pressure did not reduce the coefficient of variation, which became 29 percent in men and 30 percent in women. We conclude that the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios is wide, and it cannot be reduced by standardizing it for maximum inspiratory pressures.",

We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined.",

Within-subject changes in clearance have been generally reported in patients with acute exacerbations of disease states such as cor pulmonale or heart failure. Apparent random changes in theophylline clearance within the same patient have recently been reported. This report describes a case of suspected changes in the clearance of theophylline in a morbidly obese patient (250 kg) over a two-month period of time. Frequent dosage adjustments were required to maintain theophylline concentrations within the range of 8.2 to 27.3 micrograms/ml. Possible explanations for these changes included hypoxia and medically induced starvation. Daily theophylline doses ranged from 600 to 1600 mg/d. It is concluded that in some individuals, within-subject changes in theophylline clearance can be substantial, thus requiring frequent monitoring of theophylline concentration.",

Serum, subcutaneous adipose tissue, wound drainage, and urine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for cefamandole and pharmacokinetic parameters from the intraoperative period were compared to those obtained postoperatively. Total body clearance was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) postoperatively (297 ml/min) than intraoperatively (254 ml/min). Volume changes were unpredictable but the elimination rate constant tended to increase postoperatively. Renal clearance and percentage of urinary recovery were significantly increased (p less than 0.01) postoperatively. The patients had a mean (+/- SD) volume of the central compartment of 10.3 (+/- 2.3) L, volume at steady state of 18.3 (+/- 3.9) L, and elimination rate constant of 1.67 (+/- 0.63) h-1. Tissue concentrations of cefamandole were highest during the first hour after drug administration and were less than 1 microgram/g after 3.5 hours. Mean wound drainage concentrations ranged between 10 and 12 micrograms/ml during a dosing interval and dropped to 7 micrograms/ml 12 hours after the last dose. Intraoperative dosing of cefamandole is required to maintain subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations greater than 1 microgram/g during procedures longer than three hours in morbidly obese patients. A postoperative dose of cefamandole 2 g iv q6h will provide sustained and therapeutic concentrations in the wound drainage of morbidly obese patients.",

None of the treatments prevented ovulation. However, the combination of drugs inhibited subsequent function of the corpus luteum (CL) as assessed by serum measurements of progesterone. Administration of antihistamines did not alter pituitary secretion of LH. Injection of small quantities of diphenhydramine and cimetidine into the antrum of the preovulatory follicle also caused aberrant luteal activity, but no blockade of ovulation. Intrafollicular injection of histamine reversed the inhibitory influence of antihistamines on the CL. Antihistamines suppressed preovulatory thecal edema and antral influx of plasma transudate containing LH. Thus, the effects of antihistamines appear to have been exerted at the follicular level. Function of matured CL was not compromised by peripheral administration of antihistamines. Actions of histamine within the preovulatory ovine follicle do not appear to be a prerequisite for ovulation, but apparently do have an impact on ensuing luteal function. We propose that a hyperemic reaction to histamine in preovulatory follicles enhances vascular filtration of LH. As a consequence, maximal permeation of the avascular granulosal layer of the follicle by LH leads to a normal luteinization response.",

When progesterone-treated (2.5 mg/day, 3 days) rats received an intraluminal instillation of oil or a needle scratch stimulation in one uterine horn, the stimulated horn had an increase in wet weight and cytoplasmic protein relative to the contralateral horn. Under these conditions, IgG levels increased 10-fold in the lumen of the stimulated horn. This response was selective for IgG, because induction of DCR had no effect on accumulation of IgA or SC in the stimulated horn. The progesterone-induced accumulation of IgG after DCR was further enhanced by estradiol. The addition of a small amount of estradiol (0.2 microgram) on day 3 of a 4-day progesterone pretreatment resulted in further increases in both the wet weight of the stimulated horn and the concentration of IgG in the lumen. The amount of IgG in the lumen of the stimulated horn was 5-fold greater than that in the stimulated horn after progesterone alone. Levels of IgA and SC, however, remained unchanged with this treatment. These results indicate that movement of IgG into the uterine lumen occurs as a part of the DCR and that both an appropriate endocrine balance and physical stimulation are essential for maximal IgG accumulation. Further, they suggest that IgG may play a central role in early pregnancy, which results in the successful implantation of the blastocysts.",

Full thickness human skin grafted into the back of immunoincompetent, nude, congenitally athymic mice heals in about 6 to 10 weeks and survives the life of the mice. Mice have no sweat glands in the back so this system provides a useful model for study of the physiology and pathology of human sweat glands. The graft can be induced to sweat and the sweat collected for analytical studies. Presumably normal skin obtained from 7 individuals undergoing reconstructive surgery was grafted successfully into 11 mice. On 49 occasions sweat was induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis and collected for 45 min. The chloride concentration was 12.9 +/- 6.7 meq/liter, values typical of normal human sweat. Nine mice bearing grafts were injected with rabbit anti-human PRL (hPRL). The chloride concentration of sweat obtained a day later was significantly elevated. The concentration generally increased after a second and sometimes a third injection of anti-PRL. The average maximum sweat chloride obtained was 61.9 +/- 8.25 meq/liter. Serum of rabbits that had not been exposed to hPRL was prepared and diluted in the same way as the anti-hPRL. The chloride concentration of sweat of 3 mice that received the preparation for several days remained unchanged at the low normal level. We conclude that depletion of PRL increases the concentration of chloride in human sweat.",

We then withdrew the P (but not the E2) implants and removed uteri 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days later. Uterine tissues were assayed biochemically for ER content, fixed for histology and frozen for immunocytochemistry of ER with monoclonal antiestrophilins. On day 0, ER levels in endometrium were low [1330 +/- 201 (n = 9) fmol/mg DNA]. An increase in total receptor was evident by 3-4 days of P withdrawal 2762 +/- 190 (n = 6) fmol/mg DNA; P less than 0.001]. Total receptor concentrations increased linearly with time from 0.5-7 days of P withdrawal (r = 0.88). On day 0, staining for nuclear ER in the glandular epithelium and stroma of zones I, II, and III of the endometrium was negative. Beginning at 12-24 h and continuing through 4 days of P withdrawal, nuclear staining became detectable and increased in intensity only in endometrial stromal fibroblasts and myometrial smooth muscle cells. The glandular epithelium of the endometrium did not develop nuclear staining until 5-7 days of P withdrawal, coincident with a 10-fold increase in the mitotic index of the epithelium of the upper zones. Thus, the increase in endometrial ER levels that occurred during the first 5 days of an induced luteal-follicular transition took place almost exclusively in stromal fibroblasts.",

The relative amounts of 9 K CaBP messenger RNA (mRNA) were assayed by dot-blot hybridization and the relative amounts of 9 K CaBP by RIA. Both inhibitors were injected at doses which significantly inhibited by 80-95% [35S]methionine or [3H]uridine incorporation into protein and RNA, respectively. In vitamin D-deficient rats, a single 1,25(OH)2D3 injection (650 pmol/100 g BW) resulted in a rapid production of 9 K CaBP mRNA which was significantly detectable as early as 3 h, and was followed by an increase of 9 K CaBP levels. Injection of actinomycin D (25 micrograms/100 g BW) 1 h before 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and repeated every 4 h did not prevent the hormone-induced elevation of duodenal CaBP mRNA, even when the actinomycin dose was doubled and given 2 h before hormonal treatment. alpha-Amanitin (2 micrograms/100 g BW) also failed to block the hormonal stimulation. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (25 micrograms/100 g BW) did not cause any change in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced CaBP mRNA but blocked the CaBP increase after hormone injection. Thus, transcription inhibitors did not prevent the in vivo hormone-induced elevation of 9 K CaBP mRNA, which suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases 9 K CaBP synthesis by increasing 9 K CaBP gene expression at one or more posttranscriptional steps. More precise data will be obtained by measuring the rate of 9 K CaBP gene transcription on isolated nuclei from rat duodenum.",

Anterior pituitaries from ovariectomized rats were incubated for short periods in medium 199, with or without the steroid. Dopamine (DA) receptors in partially purified pituitary membranes were quantified by equilibrium binding using [3H]spiperone; the PRL released into the incubation medium was analyzed by RIA. Addition of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M 17 beta E2 to the incubation medium of anterior pituitaries rapidly and reversibly decreased the number of DA receptors (P less than 0.01 to 0.001), while increasing PRL release, in a dose-related fashion. The maximal effect on both receptor numbers and PRL secretion was obtained with 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. This effect involved no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM in presence or in absence of 17 beta E2). This estrogen-induced decrease in DA-binding capacity was apparently not the result of the occupation of spiperone binding sites by the steroid, since after a 30-min incubation with 10(-8) M [3H]17 beta E2, no radioactivity was detectable on the partially purified membranes. Moreover, the presence of 17 beta E2 at the same time as the labeled D2 ligand did not modify the kinetics of association or dissociation of spiperone with pituitary membranes. This decrease in anterior pituitary DA receptor content and the increase in PRL release were already significant after a 7-min incubation in the presence of 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. Finally, these effects of 17 beta E2 were not mimicked by its 17 alpha-stereoisomer, nor by progesterone, or testosterone. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 17 beta E2 on PRL secretion may be due, at least in part, to the desensitization of anterior pituitary cells to DA. The steroid may produce this desensitization directly by decreasing the number of D2. The short latency of this effect likely discards the possibility of a genomic action of 17 beta E2.",

Treatment with (Bu)2cAMP and retinol for 12-24 h and with basal medium for an additional 8 days stimulated mitotic activity in type A spermatogonia and induced differentiation of germ cells. However, (Bu)2cAMP alone did not induce differentiation of type A spermatogonia. Moreover, when cryptorchid testes were treated with (Bu)2cAMP for longer than 3 days in the presence or absence of retinol, differentiation of type A spermatogonia did not take place; disintegration of the seminiferous tubules occurred instead. When the cryptorchid testes were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing a fixed concentration of retinol and varying concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP from 0.001-0.4 mM, there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells and type A spermatogonia. Likewise, at a fixed dose of (Bu)2cAMP and increasing concentrations of retinol, a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells occurred. However, the number of type A spermatogonia was decreased. The addition of puromycin, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D to the medium completely blocked retinol-(Bu)2cAMP-induced differentiation of the germ cells. The present results suggest that cAMP and retinol trigger biochemical events promoting the synthesis of specific macromolecules involved in the proliferation and differentiation of type A spermatogonia.",

Moreover, immunocytochemical studies suggested an increase in the VIP content in the hypothalamus of lactating rats. We investigated whether this increase is regulated at the level of gene transcription. A sensitive RNA detection assay that uses in vitro transcribed RNA probes corresponding to specific exons of the VIP gene was devised to study VIP gene expression. Using this method, an approximately 2000-base long RNA containing the coding sequences for VIP was detected in rat hypothalamus. This RNA also contains the coding sequences for the VIP-related peptide PHM/I (peptide histidine methionine amide or isoleucine amide). An identical VIP-encoding RNA was previously identified in the rat cerebral cortex. A 2-fold increase was observed in hypothalamic VIP mRNA during lactation. In addition, the levels of this mRNA increased in the hypothalamus at the time of sexual maturation. Taken together, our results suggest a physiological regulation of VIP gene expression associated with its potential role as a neuroendocrine hormone.",

Preincubation of maternal thyroid tissue slices for 2 h with excess iodide (30 microM) resulted in a 31% reduction in the subsequently measured thyroid-medium radioiodide concentration ratio. In contrast, similar iodide pretreatment had no significant effect on fetal iodide transport. In all other respects, fetal iodide transport, although it was 10 times higher, did not differ significantly from maternal transport activity. Combined radiolabeled maternal (125I) and fetal (131I) rabbit thyroid tissue was eluted on Sephadex G-25 columns. Fractions were analyzed for both 125I and 131I activity, and the maternal to fetal ratios (125I/131I) were determined for each fraction. The majority of iodoproteins eluted with the void volume, and the 125I/131I ratio was constant in these fractions. Thereafter, two peaks of elevated 125I/131I activity could be observed. Peak A eluted below lysozyme (Mr = 14,300) and above insulin (Mr = 6,000), with an apparent mol wt of 8,000 to 10,000. A second peak, peak B, eluted from the column at a site similar to that of MIT or a protein of Mr of 2,000. Ascending paper chromatography of this latter peak of 125I/131I activity and MIT was carried out in two solvent systems. In both systems, peak B comigrated with MIT. These findings suggest that the failure of fetal thyroid tissue to exhibit autoregulation may be associated with the reduced iodination of a compound with an approximate Mr of 8,000 to 10,000. The role of this substance in iodide transport remains to be identified. The reason for the apparent increase in the labeling of MIT observed in maternal vs. fetal tissue is unknown.",

Thyroid slices were pretreated for 60-120 min in the presence or absence of either excess (30 microM) sodium iodide, inhibitors of protein synthesis, or both. Tissue was then washed in the presence of 2 mM methimazole to prevent subsequent iodination reaction and remove excess iodide. Iodide transport activity was finally evaluated by measurement of the ratio of tissue to medium iodide concentrations in 90-min incubations. Addition of 0.1 mM cycloheximide during the preexposure of thyroid tissue to excess iodide had no effect on either control levels of iodide transport or iodide-induced autoregulation. However, if thyroid tissue was treated with cycloheximide alone for 1 h before preexposure to excess iodide, there was a significant reduction in the degree of iodide-induced induced autoregulation. Similar results were obtained with pretreatment of the tissue with 0.5 mM puromycin and 1 microgram/ml emetine. These findings suggest that protein synthesis is involved in the mechanism of thyroid autoregulation of iodide transport. Cycloheximide had no effect on the ability of excess iodide to reduce TSH-stimulated cAMP formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-isoelectric focusing and Sephadex G-25 column chromatography employing dual-isotope comparison of iodoprotein labeling of control and cycloheximide-treated tissue suggest that the ability of cycloheximide to suppress iodide-induced autoregulation is associated with the reduced iodination of an 8- to 10-kilodalton soluble component of the thyroid gland.",

Adenylate cyclase activity was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3, particularly in cells from the midvillus.

Animals infused with 1,25-(OH)2D3 exhibited mild hypercalcemia (11.2 vs. 10.2 mg/dl in controls), a 136% increase in the serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (187 vs. 79 pg/ml), and a 59% decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (12 vs. 29 ng/ml).

Analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mRNAs, 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pIs identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells. The additional mRNA codes for glucocortin, whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported. mRNA inductions for proteins 1, 2, and 1N are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h, whereas the mRNAs for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h. The mRNA for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h, but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly. The parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mRNA levels underlie the cellular changes. Other hormones, such as estradiol, testosterone, and T3, at 10(-6) M and deoxycorticosterone at 10(-8) M do not induce these messages. Partial inductions of 1 and 2, but not 1N, are seen with deoxycorticosterone at 10(-6) M, consistent with its classification as a partial glucocorticoid agonist. Cycloheximide does not block the rise in mRNA for the most rapid inductions, 1, 2, and 1N. The results indicate that dexamethasone rapidly and specifically induces 6 thymus cell mRNAs in addition to the one coding for glucocortin. The cycloheximide results suggest that at least 3 of these represent primary steroid hormone responses.",

            "input": "Abstract: 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) affects the sensitivity of pituitary cells to several neurohormones as LHRH, TRH, or dopamine, presumably by modulating receptor coupling mechanisms. We attempted to pinpoint the membrane processes underlying this modulation and studied the effect of E2 on pituitary membrane phospholipid methylation. Anterior pituitary membranes prepared from ovariectomized (ovx) or ovx plus E2-treated rats were assayed for phospholipid methylation. Methylated phospholipids were separated by TLC. Incorporation of [3H]methyl groups into phospholipids increased with membrane concentration and incubation time with S-adenosyl-L-methyl [3H]methionine; it was not Mg2+ dependent and was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, methyltransferase inhibitor. pH was found to be critical. Formation of phosphatidyl-monoethanolamine, phosphatidyl-dimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine was markedly stimulated by treatment with E2. The effect increased progressively when animals were killed 15 h to 5 days after E2 implantation. The response involved a shift in the maximum velocity (Vmax) although there was no change in the available substrate for the methylating enzyme. This change in Vmax probably reflects changes in the amount of the methylating enzyme itself. Administration of 17 alpha-estradiol, an inactive stereoisomer of E2 was ineffective, pointing to a stereospecific interaction. After differential centrifugation of pituitary membranes, the highest specific methyltransferase activity was found in light mitochondrial (L) and microsomal (P) fractions and the lowest in nuclei (N) and the heavy mitochondrial (M) fractions. After sucrose density gradient centrifugation, methylated phospholipids were preferentially recovered from fractions corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or secretory granules. E2 treatment for 5 days did not modify the subcellular distribution of methyltransferase activity but stimulated it in all fractions; in contrast, it did not modify the activity of the other enzymes measured as fraction markers. Under the same experimental conditions, phospholipid methylation in membranes prepared from cortex, and anterior and mediobasal hypothalamic structures was not affected by the steroid, with the exception of a slight increment of [3H]methyl incorporation into mediobasal hypothalamic membrane phospholipids after 5 days of E2 treatment. These results indicate that E2-induced changes in pituitary responsiveness might be concomitant with selective effects of the steroid on specific membrane enzymatic activities involved in coupling mechanisms.",

            "input": "Abstract: From a single cell fusion, five stable hybridomas secreting antiovine placental lactogen (oPL) antibodies were obtained. Three of these secrete immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass, and the other two secrete IgM class antibodies. Ascites fluids were raised in mice for each clone and were used as the antibody component for the development of solid phase RIA. Three solid-phase RIAs were successfully established using individual IgG subclass monoclonal antibodies, but the IgM class antibodies were ineffective. In all three individual solid-phase RIAs, the binding of [125I]iodo-oPL to the immobilized antibody was inhibited by unlabeled oPL, but not by ovine pituitary PRL (oPRL), ovine GH (oGH), or ovine pituitary extract. Two of the IgG subclass antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of [125I] iodo-oPL to PRL receptors(s) and to GH receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland and liver, respectively. One of these two IgG subclass antibodies was more effective at inhibiting the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland, whereas the other one is more effective in inhibiting the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s) in rabbit liver. These antibodies, however, could only weakly inhibit the binding of [125I]iodo-oPRL to rabbit mammary gland and were ineffective in inhibiting the binding of [125I]iodo-oGH to rabbit liver. The addition of monoclonal antibodies in both radioreceptor assay (RRA) for PRL (RRA-PRL) and for GH (RRA-GH) did not affect the parallelism of the displacement curve of oPL standard. Our results suggest that oPL might contain two distinct binding sequence(s): one responsible for the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) and the other responsible for the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s). These two binding sequences might overlap or be located adjacent to one another. The interaction of monoclonal antibodies with these binding sequences of oPL may block the binding of oPL with PRL and GH receptor(s). Alternatively, our studies suggest that the monoclonal antibodies do not bind to hormone receptor(s)-binding sequence(s) in oPL, but the interaction between oPL and monoclonal antibody might alter the conformational structure of the oPL which will consequently lead to a lower binding of oPL to PRL and GH receptor(s).",

            "input": "Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes by a mechanism that is calcium dependent. In the present studies we have examined whether calmodulin participates in this response to T3. Initial experiments provided evidence that calmodulin is involved in regulating the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in this tissue. Thus, compared with findings in freshly prepared membranes, dialysis of thymocyte plasma membrane preparations for 20 h at 4 C decreased their calmodulin concentrations from an initial value of approximately 600 ng/100 micrograms protein by about 50% and decreased adenylate cyclase activity by approximately 80%. Although storage of the same preparations under comparable conditions resulted in no change in calmodulin content, it caused an approximate 30% decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Addition of calmodulin had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in fresh or stored membrane preparations, but produced a dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity in preparations that had been dialyzed. Further, when added to freshly isolated membranes, three calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, calmidazolium, and calmodulin antibodies, all produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was completely reversed in all cases by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous calmodulin. The stimulation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity that T3 induced in fresh membrane preparations was present in membranes that had been stored, but was absent in those that had been dialyzed. In addition, the response to T3 in fresh membranes was inhibited or abolished by all three calmodulin antagonists. Both in dialyzed membranes and in the presence of antagonists, the response to T3 was restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. We conclude that calmodulin influences the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in rat thymocytes and ultimately mediates the stimulation of enzyme activity that T3 produces. Such mediation very likely explains the calcium-dependent nature of the stimulatory effect of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity.",

To establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function, we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls. Cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of LH 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy. There was no change in serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine during the 4 months of the study. Cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy (P less than 0.01). In addition, the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast, that is, the activity of bone-forming cells, was decreased (P less than 0.01). Parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy. No changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure, formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls. These data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function. Osteoblastic insufficiency appears to play a major role in the maintenance of bone loss occurring after ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs.",

All animals were prepared with intraatrial Silastic catheters and bled every 15 min for 8 h (0800-1600 h). Normal male littermates displayed a characteristic low frequency, high amplitude pattern of GH secretion with bursts of GH occurring every 2.5-3 h and separated by prolonged trough periods where GH values remained low or undetectable (less than 5 ng/ml) for 45-90 min. Normal female littermates showed a characteristic high frequency, low amplitude pattern of GH secretion with pulses of GH occurring every hour. Compared to normal male littermates, females had lower individual GH peak amplitudes and shortened GH-trough periods which contain higher GH levels. GH-secretory profiles displayed by testicular-feminized animals qualitatively and quantitatively resembled those of the normal female littermates. These data suggest that androgen receptors are necessary for the expression of masculine GH-secretory patterns.",

In 21-day-old female rats, E was found to increase MBH DA levels and turnover and serum PRL concentrations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Changes were observed by 1 day, and after 3 days of E treatment (1 microgram/day), MBH DA levels increased 2-fold (to 1300 pg/mg tissue), and DA turnover rates increased 5-fold (to 1170 pg/mg tissue . h). The AEs tamoxifen, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and LY117018 (50 micrograms/day for 3 days) weakly stimulated uterine weight gain and significantly suppressed the uterotropic action of E. The AEs LY117018, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and tamoxifen competed with E for binding to the MBH estrogen receptor and displayed relative binding affinities of 190%, 185%, 6.7%, and 1.4%, with E set at 100%; these affinities are similar to those found for uterine estrogen receptors. The AEs increased DA turnover rates only 2-fold, and they antagonized the E-induced 5-fold increase in DA turnover rates very successfully. In animals treated with bromocriptine, E and AE failed to increase the low serum PRL levels, yet they evoked significant (approximately 2-fold) increases in DA turnover rates and nearly 2-fold increases in MBH DA content. Hence, a part of the actions of E and AE on MBH DA appears to be exerted independently of changes in circulating PRL and may occur by direct action of these compounds on the estrogen receptor system present in the MBH. In addition, these studies reveal that AEs behave as partial estrogen agonists/antagonists in terms of their effects on MBH DA turnover.",

For 3 h after iv bolus injection into euthyroid rats, 125I-labeled rTSH was determined by acid precipitation in serum and various organs, and unlabeled TSH was measured by RIA. The MCR of TSH from normal pituitary extracts (0.53 +/- 0.02 ml/min) was similar to that of unlabeled purified rTSH (0.52 +/- 0.03), while those from hypothyroid pituitary extracts (0.32 +/- 0.03) and hypothyroid sera (0.33 +/- 0.01) were decreased. The reduced MCR of TSH from hypothyroid pituitaries was due to a decreased distribution volume (8.4 +/- 0.6 ml) compared to that from normal pituitaries (11.4 +/- 0.7) and hypothyroid sera (10.9 +/- 0.8). The decreased MCR of circulating TSH from hypothyroid sera reflected an increase in its rt1/2 (12.6 +/- 0.5 min) vs. that from both normal (5.1 +/- 0.5) and hypothyroid (5.7 +/- 0.4) pituitaries. The rt1/2 of secreted TSH from incubated hypothyroid rat pituitaries (8.5 +/- 0.9) was intermediate between those of circulating and pituitary forms of hypothyroid rTSH. The clearances of intact bovine TSH (bTSH) and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) were compared. The dg-bTSH MCR was found to be increased (0.71 +/- 0.02 ml/min) compared to that of bTSH (0.59 +/- 0.02), primarily due to a decreased rt1/2 for dg-bTSH (3.8 +/- 0.1 min) vs. bTSH (4.7 +/- 0.2). Uptake of purified [125I]rTSH was highest in the kidney at all times, varying from 43% of the injected dose at 5 min to 54% at 180 min. We conclude that in the euthyroid rat, 1) the metabolic clearance of TSH differs between pituitary and serum forms and appears to depend on specific molecular features that vary with the physiological state of the animal from which the TSH is derived; 2) since chemical deglycosylation increased the clearance of TSH, we speculate that the chemical basis for changes in TSH clearance may be related to alterations in its carbohydrate structure; and 3) for normal pituitary TSH, the kidney is the major organ of clearance.",

Double barreled cannulae were implanted unilaterally and bilaterally in the medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), central gray, or interpeduncular nucleus. Testing was conducted using a sequential paradigm; facilitation tests commenced after 44 h of estrogen priming. P-filled cannulae placed in the VMH region facilitated lordosis behavior in 42% and 60% of unilaterally and bilaterally implanted females, respectively. In the anterior hypothalamus, only P implants adjacent to the VMH area effectively promoted receptivity. Lordosis behavior was also observed in 20-36% of females with P implants in the medial preoptic area. P implants in central gray and interpeduncular nucleus regions had no significant facilitating effect on sexual behavior. Tests for inhibition occurred 24 h after facilitation testing and consisted of a pretest, followed by systemic P administration and a behavioral test 4-5 h later. During the pretest for inhibition, females that were receptive in the facilitation test attacked males more rapidly than previously nonreceptive animals and showed decrements in lordosis scores after systemic P delivery. This biphasic effect of P completely inhibited receptivity among several animals in the VMH group. Additional experiments, however, investigating the biphasic effect of P implants in the VMH suggested that the occurrence of copulation in the facilitation test may have been involved in mediating the subsequent increase in aggressive behavior and the suppression of sexual responsiveness in the inhibition test. Nevertheless, a final experiment showed that when P was implanted sequentially in the VMH, facilitation and, more importantly, a later reduction in lordosis behavioral scores occurred even when copulation was eliminated in the facilitation test. P implants in mesencephalic regions exerted no significant inhibitory effect on receptivity. These findings demonstrate that the biphasic action of P in the female hamster is regulated by nerve cells located in the diencephalon, especially in the VMH region.",

At 37 C [125I]T3 uptake increased asymptotically; at 60 min the muscle contained 10% of the total [125I]T3 or 0.238 +/- 0.021% per mg wet tissue. At 0 C the [125I]T3 uptake was 1/5 of that at 37 C. The specific [125I]T3 uptake, determined by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 10 microM unlabeled T3 from the total [125I]T3 uptake, attained a plateau after 60 min. Washout experiments, done by first incubating the muscle for 60 min at 37 C or 0 C with [125I]T3 and then at 0 C for 3 h with unlabeled T3, showed that 21 +/- 2% or 58 +/- 4% of the radioactivity, respectively, was released, indicating an intracellular location of the hormone after incubation at 37 C. Addition of increasing concentrations of L-T3, D-T3 and L-T4 caused a progressive inhibition of the [125I]T3 uptake; the 50% inhibitory concentrations being 400 nM, 7 microM, and more than 15 microM, respectively. Preincubation of soleus muscles with metabolic inhibitors almost completely inhibited [125I]T3 specific uptake, with oligomycin and antimycin causing 98 +/- 4% and 81 +/- 3% reduction, respectively. Monodansylcadaverine and bacitracin, inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis, reduced the specific [125I]T3 uptake in a dose-dependent manner up to 67 +/- 3% and 62 +/- 2%, respectively. These results indicate the presence of a saturable, stereospecific, and energy-dependent process responsible, at least in part, for T3 uptake in rat skeletal muscle. This specific T3 uptake may be a receptor-mediated endocytosis process.",

            "input": "Abstract: Angiotensin II (AII) binds to specific receptors in the lactotroph and stimulates PRL secretion from isolated rat pituitary cells. Since estrogens exert major regulatory actions on PRL secretion, the effects of estradiol (E2) on pituitary AII receptors and PRL responses were studied in vivo and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. In female rats, treatment with E2-containing Silastic capsules for 4 days caused a significant increase in PRA from 1.3 to 3 ng/ml X min and a 38% decrease in the binding of [125I]AII to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions (P less than 0.01). In vitro studies showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells with 1 nM E2 for 4 days caused a 57 +/- 6% decrease in AII receptor concentration with no change in binding affinity. Reduction of AII receptors by E2 in 4-day cultures was dose dependent and was demonstrable with E2 concentrations that occur in plasma during the estrous cycle (0.01-1 nM). The decrease in AII receptors in cells incubated with 1 nM E2 was near maximum after 24 h of culture, and results were similar when receptor concentrations were calculated per unit protein or per cell. Despite the substantial decrease in AII receptors, E2 treatment did not specifically decrease the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to AII stimulation. Thus, PRL responses to AII (10 nM) or TRH (100 nM) were unchanged after 1 day of E2 treatment and were increased after 4 days of treatment. These findings demonstrate that E2 has a direct inhibitory action on expression of pituitary AII receptors that is not accompanied by a decrease in AII-stimulated PRL secretion. In the rat pituitary, estrogen modulation of postreceptor events is the predominant determinant of lactotroph responsiveness during stimulation of PRL release by AII.",

Using monoclonal antibodies, we have quantitated and characterized the corresponding proteins of the cell compartment. Using pulse-chase experiments, we have shown that about 40% of the 52K protein is secreted, the majority being successively processed into a 48K and a 34K protein. This last protein is very stable. The processing is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and leupeptin, suggesting that it occurs in acidic vesicles, such as lysosomes or endosomes. Estradiol increased the intracellular level of immunoreactive 52K related proteins by 4-fold. Its effect is, however, more obvious in the medium, since there is a constitutive level in the cell. The stimulatory effects of estradiol on [3H]mannose and [35S]methionine incorporation into these proteins were similar and the endoglycosydase H sensitivity of the proteins was not altered, suggesting that estradiol did not modulate the glycosylation step. Antiestrogens did not stimulate synthesis and glycosylation of the 52K related proteins. Estradiol also increased the stability of the 52K precursor as well as that of total proteins. We conclude that the secreted 52K protein is the precursor of two cellular proteins of 48K and 34K. Estradiol stimulates both the intracellular accumulation of these proteins and the secretion of the precursor.",

In these previous studies, preincubation of intact cells or ghosts with testosterone (5 X 10(-11) M) converted female-source reticulocyte membranes to male-type responsiveness to thyroid hormone (inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity). Preincubation of reticulocyte membranes with 17 beta-estradiol (5 X 10(-11) M) converted male-source membranes to female-type responsiveness (stimulation by L-T4 of membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity). Using this sex steroid-sensitive thyroid hormone-dependent membrane enzyme system, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of analogs of sex steroids and unrelated steroids. 5 beta-Androstanes were active compared to testosterone in assays using female-source membranes, while 5 alpha-androstanes were less active. Within the 5 beta-androstanes, activity was dependent on at least one hydroxyl group at the C3- or C17-position. Nongonadal steroids tested were less active, establishing specificity of the sex steroid effect in assays using female-source membranes. Assayed in male-source membranes, estrone and 3-hydroxy-1,3,5-(10)7-estratraen-17-one (equilin) were active compared for estrogen effect with 17 beta-estradiol, while estriol was less active. The activities of hydrocortisone and aldosterone were 76% and 71%, respectively, in this system. These structure-activity relationships are distinct from those described for gonadal steroid-cytoplasmic binding proteins or nuclear interactions, and represent a novel sex steroid-thyroid hormone effect on activity of a membrane enzyme.",

The effects of cAMP-related drugs on POMC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were assessed in primary cultures of intermediate (IL) and anterior rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium. 8-Bromo-cAMP (1 mM), but not 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM), induced a 2-fold increase in IL and anterior lobe cell after 2 days of treatment. A similar increase was obtained with the adenylate cyclase-activating drugs forskolin (1 microM) and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724 (100 microM). At 48 h, all these treatments had increased beta-endorphin accumulation in the medium and transiently decreased the cellular beta-endorphin content in IL cells, suggesting a parallel effect of cAMP-related drugs on secretion and biosynthesis. Incubating the cells with the Ca++ channel antagonists D600 (50 microM), verapamil (50 microM), and the dihydropyridine nifedipine (0.1 microM) decreased basal POMC mRNA levels, whereas the dihydropyridine BAYK 8644 (0.1 microM), which activates the Ca++ channel, increased POMC mRNA levels after 2 days. In addition, nifedipine decreased the stimulatory effect of forskolin, whereas BAYK 8644 further stimulated the forskolin-increased POMC mRNA levels in IL cells. We conclude that both Ca++ and cAMP may regulate the gene expression of POMC.",

However, the source(s) and specific action(s) of calcium in the secretory process have not been identified. Also undefined are the mechanisms by which regulators of PRL cell function may alter calcium distribution. In the present investigation, the elevation of medium K+ concentration during static incubations to a depolarizing concentration (56 mM) produced no change in cumulative PRL release over control levels during the 18-20 h of incubation. During perifusion incubation, exposure to high K+ concentrations briefly stimulated (less than or equal to 10 min) and then depressed PRL release. In contrast, reduced medium osmotic pressure elicited a rapid elevation in PRL release that was sustained for 2 h or more. D600, a calcium entry blocker, at 10(-5) M diminished the K+-induced pulses of PRL release. The same concentration, however, did not alter the release of PRL evoked by reduced osmotic pressure. In contrast, CoCl2, which blocks a range of calcium-mediated processes in addition to calcium influx, suppressed PRL release during perifusion and static incubations in hyposmotic medium. These findings suggest that while PRL secretion from the tilapia pituitary is calcium dependent, calcium entry through voltage-regulated plasmalemma channels may not be a prerequisite to the actions of reduced osmotic pressure.",

Recent studies show that daylength during the prenatal period is perceived by the fetus and that this perception can profoundly influence postnatal reproductive and somatic development. Using the photoperiodic Djungarian hamster, we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone, melatonin, in this prenatal perception of daylength. Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus. Infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights. These results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus.",

Treatment with rat PRL caused dose-related increases in the percentage of mammary cells that released casein and the average size of casein plaques that formed. The assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity (156 fg rat PRL per assay slide) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of PRL released from individual cells. By combining this \"plaque bioassay\" with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive PRL, it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells. The results of three separate studies revealed major differences among PRL secretors in these potency estimates. Given the existence of PRL variants with different biological and immunological efficacies, these findings suggest that PRL cells differ from one another in the molecular form(s) of hormone released.",

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits.",

This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy.",

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction). Thus, the equal activity of native IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of IGF-I (compared to IGF-II) suggest that the type II receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in L6 myoblasts.",

            "input": "Abstract: These studies were designed to characterize constitutive steroidogenesis in Leydig tumor cells. Constitutive steroidogenesis was investigated by comparing constitutively active R2C Leydig tumor cells to trophic hormone-responsive MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. Unlike the MA-10 cells, R2C cells appeared to synthesize steroid hormones independently of the cAMP-protein kinase pathway. Although the adenylate cyclase of R2C cells could be stimulated in the expected manner by cholera toxin, cAMP concentrations in these cells were low, and R2C cell steroidogenesis could be dissociated from other cAMP-dependent processes. Two cAMP-dependent processes in steroidogenic cells, protein kinase activation and lactate formation, showed low basal activities in R2C cells and could be stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP with a dose dependence similar to that detected in MA-10 cells. Steroid hormone biosynthesis parallelled these other cAMP-dependent processes in MA-10 cells, but not in R2C cells. Cycloheximide, however, caused similar dose-dependent inhibition of steroidogenesis in both the R2C and MA-10 cells. Using a cell component bioassay, it was shown that R2C cells constitutively synthesize an extramitochondrial cycloheximide-sensitive factor that is functionally identical to the factor produced in response to hCG in MA-10 cells. This factor enhanced mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis. Thus, constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells could be explained by the cAMP-independent but cycloheximide-sensitive constitutive production of an extramitochondrial factor that activated mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis.",

            "input": "Abstract: Although an action of corticosteroids to inhibit glucose transport is well known, the mechanism by which this is brought about has been unclear. Some evidence has suggested an action on insulin receptors, but a postbinding or postreceptor effect has also been reported. As hydrogen peroxide acts at a postbinding site to stimulate glucose transport, studies were carried out in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to determine whether corticosteroids would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced glucose transport. In this cell type, both insulin and hydrogen peroxide produced a marked increase in glucose transport after a 30-min incubation. The increase produced by hydrogen peroxide, as well as insulin, was inhibited by previous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone. These findings give further support to the conclusion that dexamethasone has effects on glucose transport at a postbinding site. As changes in membrane lipids influence the movement and/or activity of glucose transporters, and dexamethasone alters membrane lipids, dexamethasone-induced changes in the lipids of the plasma membrane may be important in the mediation of the steroid effect upon glucose transport.",

            "input": "Abstract: A peptide that is recognized by antibodies to human somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (Sm-C/IGF-I) has been partially purified from cultured Sertoli cells prepared from sexually immature rats. The mol wt of this peptide is about 25,000, as determined by gel filtration chromatography and immunoblot analysis of samples resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing indicated that the isoelectric point of this peptide was near neutrality. However, a smaller peptide of mol wt 8,000 that cross-reacted with antibodies to Sm-C/IGF-I, was released after gel filtration in acetic acid. Similarly, reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column under acidic conditions released a Sm-C/IGF-I immunoreactive peptide of 8,000 mol wt. This smaller species apparently resulted from the dissociation of this peptide from a binding protein. Unlike the larger neutral form, the isoelectric point of the smaller peptide was 9.8. This pI is similar to the GH-dependent Sm-C/IGF-I peptide isolated from rat serum. The small peptide, unlike the larger form, reacted in a parallel manner to human Sm-C/IGF-I in the Sm-C/IGF-I RIA and radioreceptor assays. In addition, the 8,000 mol wt peptide behaved as a progression factor in the BALB/c-3T3 assay and competed with [125I]Sm-C/IGF-I for binding to the type I Sm-C/IGF-I receptor from cultured rat Sertoli cells. In summary, results of this study demonstrate that rat Sertoli cells in culture secrete a peptide that is the rat equivalent of human Sm-C/IGF-I.",

            "input": "Abstract: Cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis in the outer (zona fasciculata/glomerulosa) and inner (zona reticularis) zones of the adrenal cortex were examined in the guinea pig. It is known from previous studies that the content of cholesterol in the inner zone is considerably lower than that in the outer zone, although basal low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity is similar in the two zones. To further explore cholesterol metabolism in the guinea pig adrenal cortex, the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, has been examined for which this paper forms the initial report. It was found that the basal specific activity of HMG-CoA reductase was similar in the outer and inner adrenocortical zones (approximately 230 pmol mevalonate formed/min X mg microsomal protein). The administration of ACTH caused 4- and 5-fold increases in HMG-CoA reductase activity in the outer and inner zones, respectively. In fact, the increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity with ACTH treatment was always greater for the inner zone than for the outer zone. This is in contrast to LDL receptor activity, which does not increase in the inner zone as it does in the outer zone with ACTH treatment. When dexamethasone was administered, HMG-CoA reductase activity decreased in the outer zone by about 50%, while there was no change in reductase activity in the inner zone. The latter finding is similar to what happens with LDL receptor activity during dexamethasone administration. Why suppression of endogenous ACTH had no effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity in the inner zone while exogenous ACTH administration caused a marked increase in enzyme activity is not clear, but may be related to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. Based on the use of sodium fluoride in solutions to block HMG-CoA reductase phosphatase, evidence is presented which indicates that a pharmacological dose of ACTH alters the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of HMG-CoA reductase in the inner adrenocortical zone, but not in the outer cortical zone.",

To determine whether the rat system serves as a general model for prodynorphin processing in the mammalian posterior pituitary, we examined the steady state levels of prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides in the posterior pituitary systems of representatives of three diverse orders of mammals: guinea pig (order Rodentia), pig (order Artiodactyla), and rhesus monkey (order Primates). In each species studied there was evidence for species-specific deviations from the rat model. The most pronounced differences were observed with respect to the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8). In rodents, rats, and guinea pigs, under steady state conditions, the molar ratios of these forms are approximately 1:2 and 2.5:1, respectively. However, in the pig and rhesus monkey, the molar ratios of these forms are 10:1 and 14:1, respectively. Thus, under steady state conditions, the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8) appears to be a minor event in porcine and rhesus monkey posterior pituitary. Species-specific variations were also observed with respect to the steady state levels of alpha-neo-endorphin and dynorphin B-(1-13). In addition, the results of these studies suggest that the conversion of prodynorphin-derived opioids to leu-enkephalin probably represents a minor event in the species studied.",

Pituitary glands from both sexes at different ages were monodispersed with 0.1% trypsin. Freshly dispersed cells were incubated in Cunningham chambers for measurement of the fraction of plaque-forming cells and the size of plaques formed, or attached to glass slides for measurement of the fraction of cells staining for PRL by ICC. The percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5% of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54% in the females at proestrus and about 37% in the males. Sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter. The mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1,100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15,600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6,700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age; then fell to the adult levels of about 5,500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3,200 microns 2 in males. Sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent. The results from ICC closely matched those from the plaque assay, except at 5 days of age and in the adult males. At 5 days, the fraction of cells staining for PRL was twice that of cells forming plaques. In adult male rats there were about 47% immunostained PRL cells but only about 39% plaque-forming cells. This difference, however, disappeared after estrogen treatment. These results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent.",

Uterine flushings (UTF) and endometrium (ENDOM) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts (n = 9) were collected on days 10, 12, and 14 (n = 3). Protein, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.05), Na+, and K+ (P less than 0.01) increased linearly in UTF of pregnant gilts. Ca2+ changed biphasically, with higher concentrations (P less than 0.01) in pregnant gilts on day 12. Endometrial cAMP and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy. The UTF norepinephrine (NE) concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14, while endometrial NE increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. The UTF of pregnant gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) concentrations of dopamine (DA), which peaked on day 12 and then decreased (P less than 0.01) by day 14. DA in UTF of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. A catecholamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, in ENDOM (P less than 0.05) and UTF (P less than 0.01) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. The turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher (P less than 0.05) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts. Effects of acute administration of exogenous E (0.5 mg) were also studied. The UTF and ENDOM were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0, 30, 60, and 360 min (n = 3) post-E or post-saline-ethanol (C) injection (n = 9). Potassium, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.01), and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased rapidly (30 min) after E injection. The K+ level changed biphasically, with increased concentrations again at 360 min. Plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min, whereas cGMP remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when E, Ca2+, K+ (P less than 0.01), and Na+ (P less than 0.03) were increased. ENDOM NE (P less than 0.05) and UTF DA (P less than 0.05) were lower in E-treated gilts. Additionally, the turnover rate was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) for NE and DA in the UTF of E-treated gilts. An increase in Ca2+ in UTF preceded increases in protein secretions (except plasmin inhibitor) and may play a role in E-stimulated endometrial epithelial secretory vesicle exocytosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

We have examined the effects of five other estrogens: estriol, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol. All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses.",

The monolayer permeability to [3H]inulin decreased rapidly during the initial 3-5 days of culture for the Sc isolated from 18- and 14-day old animals, then remained stable in all media except DFM. Morphological examination revealed the presence of tight junctions between neighbouring Sc in both age groups, indicating their de novo formation. Secretion of Trf was lowest in DFM and steadily declined. In all other media, Trf secretion peaked on day 5 and remained relatively constant after day 7. Medium 7F only slightly and inconsistently increased the secretion, whereas 8F was always highly stimulatory compared to 6F. Supplementation of 6F with serum resulted in the greatest Trf secretion. In the case of ABP, three different secretion patterns were noted depending on the medium composition; secretion was greatest in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. The medium supplements also differentially affected the polarity of Trf and ABP secretion. The ratio of Trf secreted to the outer and inner compartments (OC/IC) was approximately 2.0 in DFM and was not influenced by supplements in 6F, 7F, and 8F. However, in serum-containing media, the OC/IC ratio gradually increased with time to about 5.0 on day 13. The average OC/IC ratio of ABP was 1.7 in DFM and, in contrast to Trf, declined to 0.7 in other serum-free media. Serum supplementation reversed and increased the ABP ratio to about 6.0 on day 13. These data indicate that Sc grown on permeable supports form confluent monolayers that limit the diffusion of macromolecules, most likely due to the formation of tight junctions. The monolayer permeability as well as the total and polarized secretion of Trf and ABP are differentially regulated by hormones and serum factors.",

Controls received either 0.01 M PBS (1 ml, im; n = 2) or 0.01 M gel-PBS (gel; 1 ml, os; n = 2) in cervical os. One relaxin-treated (im) heifer calved at 4 h and 36 min after treatment; thus, data from this heifer were not included in subsequent analysis. Relaxin-treated heifers showed an acute elevation in relaxin, a precipitous decrease in progesterone, and a significant (P less than 0.05) elevation of E1 and 17 beta-E2. Plasma relaxin levels were 4.95, 1.5, and 0.24 ng/ml at 0.5 h in RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and control animals, respectively. Peripheral plasma relaxin peaked between 23-31 ng/ml 1-2.5 h before returning to less than 0.5 ng/ml 5-12 h after treatment. Relaxin administration accounted for 70%, 73%, and 58% of the progesterone, E1, and 17 beta-E2 variability between treatments, respectively. An abrupt decrease (P less than 0.01) in progesterone preceded the rises (P less than 0.05) in E1 and 17 beta-E2 at 1.5, 2-2.5, and 2-3.5 h, respectively. Maximum progesterone deviations from the pretreatment mean concentration were -5.43, -3.05, and -0.92 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls. Progesterone rebounded from 36% to 61% and 62% to 79% of respective pretreatment means for RLX-IM and RLX-OS. Peak elevation of E1 was 407.3, 306.5, and 71.5 pg/ml and that of 17 beta-E2 was 82.2, 35.8, and 7.8 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that a pharmacological dosage of relaxin induces an acute depression of progesterone secretion beginning within 90 min in beef heifers during late pregnancy. We suggest that these early and marked luteolytic effects of relaxin on progesterone secretion in cattle could be by direct or indirect actions via mechanisms that are yet unknown.",

            "input": "Abstract: In order to investigate the localization of nuclear T3 receptors in adult rat brain, we have developed a technique for separating neuronal and glial nuclei, and compared nuclear T3 binding in both fractions. Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus.",

In the first experiment, short day anestrous females were transferred to long days to detect hormonal changes associated with recovery of cyclicity. Morning and afternoon blood samples were taken at increasing durations in long days. Females autopsied at their first vaginal estrus after transfer to long days differed from long day estrous controls only in their lower uterine weights. Some females at all durations exhibited signs of recovery, though they had not yet shown estrus. They did not display afternoon gonadotropin surges and had low circulating progesterone but high estradiol levels, stimulated uteri, and enhanced follicular development. Results of the second and third experiments provided evidence that the daily gonadotropin surges are not the cause per se of anestrus, and that changes in estrogen secretion are essential for the transition to and from anestrus. Phenobarbital blockade of the daily surges in anestrous females did not result in increased follicular growth and estrogen secretion. Furthermore, daily afternoon injections of gonadotropins it appears that the daily surges in anestrous hamsters simply reflect low estradiol levels. It is still not known what signal promotes rapid follicular maturation during the recovery from anestrus. Once initiated, however, this recovery appears to occur within a few days, with a rapid cascade of events. First, follicular development and estrogen secretion resume, and the daily LH surges cease. Then, progesterone levels decline, and an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins is triggered.",

            "input": "Abstract: TSH is a glycoprotein hormone whose carbohydrate content varies among different species. Although recent studies suggest that variants of TSH deficient in carbohydrate occur naturally, the significance of the carbohydrate moiety of TSH in respect to its thyrotropic function is unclear. The present studies were undertaken, therefore, to examine this question. A highly purified preparation of bovine TSH (bTSH) was deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses of the original and deglycosylated preparations indicated that approximately 85% of the carbohydrate originally present had been removed and that the protein moiety was unaltered. As judged from TSH radioreceptor assays, bTSH and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) bound to human thyroid membranes with equal affinity, since both caused a half-maximal inhibition of [125I]bTSH binding at approximately equal concentrations. Nonetheless, dg-bTSH at optimal concentration displayed only about one third the activity of intact TSH in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membranes. dg-bTSH also antagonized the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of intact bTSH in this system, but only weakly, since abolition of the bTSH effect required an approximately 40-fold higher concentration of dg-bTSH. In cultures of FRTL5 cells, a cloned line of follicular cells derived from normal rat thyroid, both intact and dg-bTSH enhanced cell growth, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated cAMP release in the medium, but the response elicited by dg-bTSH was much less than that caused by equal concentrations of the intact hormone. In accord with the findings in the in vitro assays, dg-bTSH evoked a much smaller response than bTSH did in the in vivo mouse assay. It is concluded that although not required for receptor recognition, the carbohydrate moiety of bTSH is essential for the full expression of its biological activity.",

In vitro incubation of granules with reduced glutathione (GSH) results in the production of monomeric hormones and increased hormone release. We tested the hypothesis that increases in intragranular osmolality due to conversion of oligomers to lower mol wt forms are key to granule rupture. Hormone release was measured after granule incubations in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of raffinose or sucrose. PRL release at pH 7.8 with 0.7 M raffinose was reduced to 43.5% of the control value, whereas GH release ranged from 70-100% of the control value. Augmented release stimulated by 2 mM GSH was also diminished by raffinose, to 17.9% (PRL) and 75.6% (GH) of control values. The IC50 for raffinose inhibition of PRL release was 0.62 M; this shifted to 0.38 M in the presence of 2 mM GSH. Raffinose also blunted the granule response to GSH at all other GSH concentrations tested and decreased stimulated release at pH 9 as well as at 7.8. Interference with the ability to maintain an osmotic gradient, a maneuver accomplished by partial disruption of granule membranes with 0.5% deoxycholate treatment, reduced or abolished the raffinose inhibition. Molecular sizing of granule fractions on Superose-6 (Pharmacia) indicated that PRL monomers remaining in the pelletable granule fraction increased with raffinose about 2-fold under both basal and GSH-stimulated conditions. These data support the concept that thiol:disulfide equilibria may be important in PRL and GH storage and secretion by their influence on intragranular osmolality. In exocytosis in vivo, osmotically mediated granule rupture may be triggered by thiols during granule:plasma membrane fusion.",

The chicks were fed for 3 weeks a vitamin D-deficient diet but were supplemented with radioactive labeled vitamin D3. The chicks were then divided into two groups. In the first group the right tibia was fractured, whereas the second group served as nonfractured control group. During the following days of fracture healing, the metabolites of [3H]vitamin D3 were measured in callus, epiphysis, diaphysis, plasma, duodenum, and kidney. Histological examination of calluses and bones, measurements of intestinal absorption of calcium, and renal production of dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D3 were performed as well. The levels of the dihydroxylated metabolites were increased in the calluses and the levels of [3H]24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were found to coincide with the formation of cartilaginous tissue and with the renal production of this steroid. In the duodenum of the fractured chicks, the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 dropped significantly during the first week after fracture, coinciding with reduction in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In the plasma during those 3 weeks of healing process the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were far below normal. These findings indicate that during the process of fracture repair, changes in the metabolism and expression of vitamin D are taking place in order to meet the new requirements of the body under stress condition of skeletal fracture.",

MDA-MB-157 cells were shown to express the alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme produced by normal breast tissue, and the activity of this isoenzyme increased 3-fold after a 72-h treatment of these cells with 10(-7) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], 2-fold after treatment with 10(-6) M hydrocortisone (HC), and 5-fold after treatment with both hormones. BT20 cells did not express the isoenzyme phenotypic to breast, but ectopically expressed the isoenzyme phenotypic to term placenta and other embryonic tissue. Treatment of BT20 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 results in a 30% decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity of the embryonic isoenzyme. There was a 2-fold increase in activity after treatment with HC, and enzyme activity was similar to control values after treatment with both hormones. For both cell lines, changes in alkaline phosphatase activity correlated with changes in nanograms of isoenzyme per mg cellular protein, as measured by RIA. Increases in enzyme activity were inhibited when the cells were incubated simultaneously with the steroids and cycloheximide. Studies with receptors in each cell line showed that both cell lines bound 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that a 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding protein with the same mol wt as the D3 receptor was present in both. The BT20 cells also express a larger mol wt protein which binds 1,25-(OH)2D3 but is not as specific for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 isomer. HC receptors were similar in quantity and binding affinity in both cell lines.",

Radioautographs of two-dimensional gels of the in vitro translational products of RNA were quantitated by computer-assisted videodensitometry and analyzed by multivariate statistics. Of the 250 spots observed, each presumably representing the translational product of a separate messenger RNA, 21 were responsive to changes in hormonal state. Eighteen increased and two decreased at some stage in the transition from the hypothyroid to the hyperthyroid state. One spot changed in a biphasic manner. Eight products responded to the lipogenic diet, six increasing and two decreasing. Six of these eight spots responded in a similar fashion to thyroid hormone administration. As previously shown for liver, there appears to be a substantial overlap between the genomic response to carbohydrate and thyroid hormone administration. Whereas the carbohydrate-generated changes are largely included in the thyroid-hormone induced alterations, the majority of thyroid hormone responsive changes are not duplicated by the diet. Multivariate analysis showed a clear separation of each state from the others and revealed that it was necessary to monitor only nine spots to achieve an effective separation of the states analyzed.",

Maximal binding capacity was measured by in vivo saturation analysis. Nuclear receptor occupancy at endogenous levels of T3 and T4 in euthyroid rats was estimated from the equilibrium nuclear to serum ratio of tracer T3, and the locally generated nuclear T3 to serum T4 ratio after injecting tracer T3 and T4. These ratios were multiplied, respectively, by the endogenous concentrations of T3 and T4 as measured by RIA. The maximal binding capacity was 0.65 ng T3/mg DNA, and saturation was 71%. Fifty-five percent of the nuclear T3 was generated locally, and 45% was derived from circulating T3. BAT is, hence, comparable to the liver in number of receptors (approximately 5000/cell) and to the pituitary with regard to saturation and relative contributions of locally generated T3 and plasma T3 to nuclear T3. These results suggest that BAT may be an important target for thyroid hormones and, along with other data, that alterations in the activity of the type II 5'-deiodinase of this tissue may influence the saturation of nuclear T3 receptors.",

            "input": "Abstract: The effect of prolonged osmotic stimulation on the oxytocin (OT) mRNA levels of OT-producing neurons was investigated in separate hypothalamic nuclei of the rat. After drinking 2% NaCl for 2 weeks, a 2-fold increase in the OT mRNA content was found by Northern blot analysis of microdissected supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The same samples showed a similar change in vasopressin (VP) mRNA levels. This treatment resulted in a 70% depletion of both OT and VP from the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and a marked increase in OT and VP plasma levels. Analysis of the OT mRNA concentration by quantitative in situ hybridization showed that the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus responded similarly, with a 1.5-fold increase in OT mRNA after 7 days of osmotic stimulation. These results demonstrate that OT gene expression in the magnocellular neurons of the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus is sensitive to this osmotic stimulus, as is the VP gene of magnocellular neurons in the SON and PVN. The responsiveness of OT-producing neurons may point to a role for OT in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance.",

            "input": "Abstract: One of the earliest responses of the thyroid cells to TSH is macropinocytosis with formation of intracellular colloid droplets. We demonstrate here that increasing stimulation with TSH not only elicits a highly individual macropinocytotic response among different follicular cells but that the fraction of TSH-responsive cells is also a function of the TSH dose. After pretreatment with T4, mice and rats were injected ip with bovine TSH and killed 2 h later. The macropinocytotic response to TSH was evaluated on periodic acid-Schiff-stained 3-microns sections of the thyroids in terms of droplet number per 25 follicles and, in addition, by assessing recruitment, i.e. percentage of droplet-containing cells. Both variables increased with increasing TSH stimulation until they reached a plateau at about 9 mU TSH in mice and at about 300 mU TSH in rats: the percentage of droplet-containing cells gradually increased in mice from 2% (no TSH) to 67% (9 mU TSH) and in rats from 11% (no TSH) to 54% (300 mU TSH). Overall pinocytotic response as well as thyrocyte recruitment could be modified by extra- and intrathyroidal factors: for example, pretreatment of the mice with an iodine-deficient diet increased the maximal percentage of droplet containing cells to nearly 90%. Obviously, two separate components of the macropinocytotic response of the thyroid gland to TSH can be distinguished: the first is the gradually increasing fraction of droplet-containing cells, the second is the well known increase of the number of colloid droplets in each TSH-responsive cell with progressive TSH stimulation. Recruitment of thyrocytes with a gradually increasing natural threshold to a hormonal stimulus appears to be a fundamental mechanism in the thyroid gland and possibly in other organs.",

This was caused by excessive polytherapy in one case and by the use of the inappropriate drug (for that type of epilepsy) in four other cases. In the sixth case, the appropriate anticonvulsant was used, but it induced multiple astatic-myoclonic seizures. This phenomenon of drug-induced seizures is apt to occur particularly in certain types of childhood epilepsy that are refractory to therapy and are accompanied by slow spike-wave discharges in the EEG, such as the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",

The density of IEDs peaked during non-REM stages and was significantly reduced during REM stage. Mean plasma PRL concentrations in epileptic patients, when sampled at 30-min intervals, showed a moderate but significant elevation during non-REM (p less than 0.001) and awake stages (p less than 0.005), but not during REM stage, when compared with 10 nonepileptic control subjects studied in a similar fashion. The data obtained in this physiologically controlled environment indicate that the cumulative effect of IEDs may modify PRL regulatory mechanisms, resulting in a modest elevation of plasma concentrations independent of ictal discharges.",

The percentage of partial seizures (67%) was significantly increased in proportion to a series of 100 adult epilepsy patients, with a comparable age distribution. In 10 patients (including three patients with symptomatic epilepsy), the attacks appeared before the MS symptoms. The mean follow-up after the first seizures was 19.3 years. In 10 patients, the seizures disappeared totally during the surveillance until September 1985. Our results show an increased comorbidity between MS and epilepsy.

This lack of correlation may be due to variations in the metabolic activity of the endometriotic implants present at different stages of the disease. Because prostaglandin F (PGF) has been implicated as a hormonal mediator of the clinical symptoms of endometriosis, PGF synthesis and content was measured in implants from 14 patients with mild, moderate, severe, or extensive disease. To assess whether PGF production was related to the status of implants, the authors classified implants, based on gross and histologic criteria, as petechial or reddish; intermediate or brown; or powder-burn or black. PGF production of implants from patients with mild or moderate disease was greater than that of implants from patients with severe or extensive disease (P less than 0.05), and PGF content was similar for all stages of endometriosis. Petechial implants produced twice the amount of PGF than intermediate implants (P less than 0.05), which in turn produced more PGF than powder-burn implants (P less than 0.05). Powder-burn implants did not have the in vitro capacity to produce PGF, and the amount of PGF contained in implants of all classes was similar. Therefore, endometriotic implant PGF production and possibly other biochemical activities are dependent on the physical status of the implant. The classification of implants by morphologic appearance may afford additional assistance in determining the prognosis of the disease and in the examination of the subtle effects of the disease on symptoms.",

Laser CO2 microsurgical salpingostomies were performed on 76 patients between January 1979 and January 1984. All of the patients underwent a preoperative assessment, which included hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopy, to formulate a preoperative classification based on a point system. The patients were divided into four groups according to tubal damage, with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 58.3% in grade I, 36.6% in grade II, 9.5% in grade III, and 0% in grade IV. The patients were divided into four groups according to adhesions, with a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy rate of 38.8% with no adhesion, 32.0% with mild adhesions, 26.6% with moderate adhesions, and 5.5% with severe adhesions. From these results, a preoperative management is proposed for patients being considered for either distal tubal microsurgery or in vitro fertilization.",

This was followed by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase. In the second case follicular growth was abrupted by premature LH surge. This surge was triggered by early rise of E2 level while the follicle was still small in size. In the third case luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome was diagnosed, on ultrasound examination.

The subsequent histories of 144 women who did not return for surgery were examined, to determine whether failure to return might have screened, selectively, the women at greatest risk of regret. High levels of subsequent unwanted conception and pregnancy wastage were found in the nonreturn group. Institutional factors were often implicated in failure to return.

The hCG levels of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hCG levels at 7 and 8, 19 and 20, and 37 and 38 days after ET. In a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hCG levels of normal singleton IVF pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton IVF pregnancies. The observed cyclic hCG secretion may be indicative of early embryo deaths. This observation supports the contention that multiple ET results in significantly more multiple implantations than previously appreciated.

Time-course studies indicated that maximal cAMP response to hCG was obtained in 1 to 3 hours. Both basal and hCG-stimulated P accumulation continued to rise for up to 24 hours.

Some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery. The authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens. To ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis, unilateral anastomosis was done primarily. In a few cases, cross-over anastomosis was necessary. In cases of reoperation, if possible, this was performed on the same side. When the epididymal duct system was found empty, the contralateral epididymis was explored. Patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation. From 1980 to 1984, 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy. At follow-up evaluation, 35 (85%) presented sperms in repeated tests. Fifteen of these patients (37%) have fathered children. Patients with postoperative normospermia and no antisperm antibodies had an excellent fertility prognosis. The single-loop dissection technique provides anatomic specificity and a high percentage of patent anastomoses and does not interfere with the possibilities of reoperation.",

The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level. Thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.",

Ten more rats had implants that were left untreated. The results were compared with those of ten rats that had sham surgery with implantation of fat in the uterine mesenteries. Reproductive performance was better in control animals with sham surgery than in animals with endometrial implants. Maximum restoration of fertility was achieved with indomethacin. Microsurgery and danazol therapy both were effective in preventing residual endometriosis, but the animals tended to be less fertile after treatment. Adhesions were most pronounced after diathermy and least pronounced after microsurgery or indomethacin therapy. In rats treated with indomethacin, persistent endometriotic cysts were invariably smaller near the site of intraperitoneal injection: this suggests a local antiprostaglandin effect.",

Seven patients with virilization and hyperandrogenism of various causes were evaluated with the use of sequential studies: testosterone stimulation and suppression tests; computerized tomography (CT); selective venous catheterization; and 131I-iodomethyl-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy. Comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of these localization studies with the ultimate diagnoses in this group of virilized women showed that: endocrinologic suppression/stimulation studies are of limited value in tumor localization and helpful only in patients with steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies; both selective catheterization and CT scanning may provide spurious localization data; and NP-59 scintigraphy, by depicting both the anatomic localization and functional androgen hypersecretion, may provide the most significant localization data in the evaluation of patients with virilizing syndromes.",

The overall mean duration of infertility for these women was 5.68 +/- 0.33 years (mean +/- standard error) and their mean age was 30.20 +/- 0.46 years. Fifty-two of these women had primary infertility. Three treatment protocols were evaluated. Twenty-five women with unexplained infertility (Group A) received low-dose bromocriptine (1.25 to 2.5 mg) at bedtime for the first 18 days of the cycle; 18 women with unexplained infertility (group B) received 100 mg of pyridoxine continuously; and 16 women receiving clomiphene citrate (group C) also received bromocriptine in a manner similar to that for group A. All subjects were followed for six treatment cycles or until pregnancy occurred. The estimated cumulative pregnancy rate after six treatment cycles was 65% for groups A and C, which is significantly higher than the 22% rate for group B (Lee-Desu statistic = 4.66, P = 0.03). Women treated with bromocriptine were 2.3 times more likely to conceive than women treated with pyridoxine. Furthermore, those infertile galactorrheic women whose random prolactin level was greater than or equal to 15 ng/ml were most likely to conceive. Expressible galactorrhea in women with unexplained infertility and high normal prolactin concentrations may serve as a clinical sign indicating those women who may benefit from low-dose bromocriptine treatment administered at bedtime.",

The dose of norethindrone required to elicit secretory phase activity was about 0.35 mg/day.

No antibodies against endometrial glycoproteins or against \"progestin dependent endometrial protein\" (PEP) were found in any serum or peritoneal fluid sample. Levels of PEP were not different in serum from women with moderate to severe endometriosis (n = 6), with mild endometriosis (n = 21), or from disease-free cycling controls (n = 19). PEP levels in peritoneal fluid from mild endometriosis and from controls did not differ but were elevated ten times in fluid obtained in the secretory phase from women with moderate to severe disease. This suggests that PEP levels in peritoneal fluid reflect the extent of ectopic endometrial growth. The salient finding was a heretofore undescribed protein (mol wt 70,000) in secretory phase peritoneal fluid samples (18/20) and its absence during the proliferative phase (0/35).",

Eleven of 24 (45.8%) women attempting conception following conservative laparoscopic removal of an ectopic gestation from the sole remaining fallopian tube established an intrauterine pregnancy. In this same group, seven patients (29.2%) had a second ectopic pregnancy. The fertility results were also analyzed according to the previous history. The postoperative intrauterine pregnancy rate was 85.5% among 62 patients without a history of infertility (group I), compared with 41.1% among 56 patients with a history of infertility or a previous ectopic pregnancy (group II). The subsequent ectopic pregnancy rate in group I was 16.1% versus 28.6% in group II.

The increase in sperm output seems to be associated with relaxations of myoid cells, which lead to dilatation of stenotic areas of seminiferous tubules, occurring discontinuously, and subsequent maintenance of good tubular fluid flow.

Biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure, rectum, and any visualized tumors were taken. The specimens were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to detect neutral mucins, high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins, fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin, and fluoresceinated Ulex europeus agglutinin. None of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa. However, Ulex europeus agglutinin, which bound to only 3% of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study, bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals, reaching a maximum of 90% positivity by 13-16 wk. Moreover, Ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93% of tumors. Mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum (but not the splenic flexure) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals, but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia. We conclude that Ulex europeus agglutinin binding is a consistent feature of premalignant colonic mucosa in dimethylhydrazine-treated rats.",

Results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male F344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, or Mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation. Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation. It is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans.",

Of 128 isolates, multiple serotypes were defined and all were biochemically typical for Yersinia enterocolitica. Other agents were seen in 20 patients; of these, seven were Yersinia fredriksenii and six were Clostridium difficile. Diarrhea (80%) and abdominal pain (64%) were common, whereas other features such as fever (9%) and bloody stools (8%) were unusual. Use of antibiotics (24%) or opiates (28%) in the month before culture was common. The terminal ileum was seen radiographically in 20 patients, but only two barium studies showed abnormalities. Fiberoptic endoscopy and biopsy studies, done in greater than 50% of the cases, showed minimal or no changes in most patients. However, 3 patients had pseudomembranous colitis with concomitant Clostridium difficile cytotoxin and 7 had diffuse severe colitis. New culture techniques, and possibly geographic differences, have contributed to the high isolation rates of this organism. Yersinia enterocolitica occurs sporadically, involves a variety of serotypes, and is associated with a broader clinical spectrum than was formerly appreciated.",

Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity was measured in gastric and duodenal aspirates from 5 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency secondary to alcoholism and in aspirates from 5 alcoholics without evidence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (controls). Samples were collected under fasting and postprandial conditions. All patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency had nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in gastric and duodenal aspirates. Lipolytic activity in gastric aspirates was not significantly different between the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the controls during the fasting and postprandial periods. Pancreatic insufficiency was associated with significantly (p less than 0.05) higher nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in the duodenum under fasting conditions. No significant difference between the groups was found in postprandial nonpancreatic lipolytic activity. Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity accounted for approximately 90% of total lipolytic activity at the ligament of Treitz in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as opposed to 7% in the control subjects. These observations suggest a significant role for nonpancreatic lipolytic activity (lingual lipase and gastric lipase) in fat digestion in patients with pancreatic insufficiency secondary to chronic alcohol abuse.",

In this report, we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100% ethanol. There was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron. Capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa. Pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine, 30 mg/100 g, or intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.5 mg/100 g, significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended. Pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.2 mg/100 g, afforded no significant protection. We conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100% ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa, and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine, or with a large dose of prostaglandin F2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries.",

Acid clearance was measured at 5 cm. above the manometrically located lower esophageal sphincter (LES) after injecting a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 15 cm. above the LES. The acid was labeled with 200 mu Ci of 99mTc-sulfur colloid. Acid clearance was also measured at 10 cm. above the LES after injection of a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 20 cm. above the LES. Acid clearance at 5 cm. above the LES was faster in GER patients with no HH compared to GER patients with HH and asymptomatic HH subjects. Acid clearance was faster at 10 cm. than 5 cm. above the LES in all HH and non-HH subjects studied. In non-HH subjects, each swallow resulted in an increase in pH (a monophasic pH response) at 5 and 10 cm. above the LES. In symptomatic as well as asymptomatic HH subjects, swallows resulted in an initial fall followed by a rise in pH at 5 cm. above the LES (a biphasic pH response). Radionuclide studies showed reflux of the isotope-labeled acid into the esophagus followed by clearance (a biphasic response) accompanying swallows in 15 of the 20 HH subjects. Swallow-induced reflux was not detected by radionuclide scanning in non-HH subjects. Based on these observations, we conclude that during acid clearance a small amount of acid is trapped in the HH sac and refluxes into the esophagus during subsequent swallows when there is relaxation of the LES, and these repeated episodes of acid reflux from the HH account for the delayed acid clearance observed in GER patients with HH.",

Three hydrolysates of egg white and an equivalent amino acid mixture were perfused at 30 mmol/L and 100 mmol/L in two separate experiments. Two hydrolysates (OH1 and OH2) contained mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, whereas the third (OH3) comprised tripeptide to pentapeptides as judged chromatographically. Nitrogen absorption was significantly slower from the higher chain length mixture, OH3, than from the short chain mixtures, OH1 and OH2, at both concentrations. Similarly, several amino acid residues were absorbed less well from OH3 than from OH1 and OH2. These data demonstrate that the chain length of heterogeneous mixtures of peptides affects absorption of nitrogen and individual amino acid residues, and suggest that brush border hydrolysis of tetrapeptides and pentapeptides limits absorption from enzymic hydrolysates of protein which simulate the composition of the postprandial luminal contents.",

The alpha-epitope was localized to the pepsin region of the molecules. The two major alpha-PG I isozymogens (Pg 3 alpha and Pg 5 alpha) and the major beta-PG I isozymogen (Pg 4 beta) were demonstrated to contain net charge differences located in the respective pepsin and activation peptide regions.

            "input": "Abstract: We studied radiolabeled fecal bile acid excretion in 11 normal subjects and 17 patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea for three major purposes: to establish normal values for this test in the presence of increased stool volumes (induced in normal subjects by ingestion of poorly absorbable solutions); to test for bile acid malabsorption in the patients and to correlate this with an independent test of ileal function, the Schilling test; and to compare the results of the bile acid excretion test with the subsequent effect of a bile acid binding agent (cholestyramine) on stool weight. In normal subjects fecal excretion of the radiolabel was increased with increasing stool volumes. As a group, patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea excreted radiolabeled bile acid more rapidly than normal subjects with induced diarrhea (t1/2 56 +/- 8 vs. 236 +/- 60 h, respectively, p less than 0.005). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between t1/2 of radiolabeled bile acid and Schilling test results in these patients. Although 14 of 17 patients absorbed labeled taurocholic acid less well than any of the normal subjects with comparable volumes of induced diarrhea, cholestyramine had no statistically significant effect on stool weight in the patient group, and in none of the patients was stool weight reduced to within the normal range. In summary, most patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea have bile acid malabsorption (as measured by fecal excretion of labeled bile acid), but they do not respond to cholestyramine therapy with a significant reduction in stool weight. Although the significance of these findings was not clearly established, the most likely interpretation is that bile acid malabsorption is a manifestation of an underlying intestinal motility or absorptive defect rather than the primary cause of diarrhea.",

The effect of cisapride on gastric emptying of solids was studied in 9 diabetic patients, all of whom had delayed gastric emptying of indigestible solids (gastroparesis). Six patients had chronic nausea and vomiting, and 3 had no symptoms. Cisapride (5 mg) was given intravenously 15 min before ingestion of a 400-kcal test meal and 10 indigestible solid radiopaque markers. On separate days and in random order each patient also received intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) or placebo 15 min before ingestion of the meal and markers. Mean gastric emptying of radiopaque markers, assessed by serial radiographs of the gastric region, was accelerated by metoclopramide and cisapride, but the difference reached significance only with cisapride (p less than 0.05). There was considerable intersubject variability in gastric emptying responses to cisapride and metoclopramide. No side effects occurred with either drug. This study indicates that acute, intravenous administration of cisapride accelerates gastric emptying of indigestible solids in patients with diabetic gastroparesis.",

These regional differences were used to characterize pharmacologically CCK receptors on smooth muscle cells and neurons of the gastric fundus, gallbladder, and ileum of the guinea pig. In circular and longitudinal ileal smooth muscle, tetrodotoxin was used to separate direct from neurally mediated contractile effects. Cholecystokinin receptors on smooth muscle cells were found in all locations. The muscle cells displayed a decreasing order of sensitivity to the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin as expressed in the median doses, and to the selective cholecystokinin antagonist, proglumide, as expressed in the inhibitory dissociation constants. The median doses of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ranged from 5.5 nM in gallbladder muscle to 185 nM in circular ileal muscle; the corresponding inhibitory dissociation constants of proglumide ranged from 180 to 437 microM [corrected]. Cholecystokinin receptors on cholinergic neurons were confined to circular and longitudinal ileal muscle; the neurons were 80-300 times more sensitive to the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (D50's 0.5 and 2.3 nM) than the corresponding muscle cells, and 19-21 times more sensitive to proglumide (inhibitory dissociation constants, 20 microM [corrected]). The results provide clear evidence of cellular heterogeneity of cholecystokinin receptors (i.e., difference in sensitivity between muscle cells and neurons from the same location) as well as regional heterogeneity (i.e., difference in sensitivity between muscle cells from various locations).",

Furthermore, the amount of HBcAg was positively correlated with the amount of free viral DNA in the liver tissue. In contrast, HBsAg was well expressed not only in the liver with free viral DNA, but also in the liver with integrated DNA.

The plasma levels and hepatic uptake of the steroids dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, estradiol, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were assessed. Systemic plasma levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced, whereas those of androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol were significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated in men with alcoholic cirrhosis when compared to controls. Sex hormone binding globulin levels were also significantly elevated (p less than 0.01). The hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the degree of liver function impairment as shown by the linear significant relationship between their hepatic extractions and that of indocyanine green (r = 0.74-0.92, p less than 0.05; except for dihydrotestosterone, r = 0.17, not significant). In addition, the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the binding affinity to sex hormone binding globulin. The higher the affinity for sex hormone binding globulin, the lower the hepatic uptake influenced by liver function impairment. It was estimated that hepatic clearances accounted for only 20%-50% of the metabolic clearance of sex steroids. No significant relationship between plasma levels of sex steroids and their hepatic clearance was found. We show here that in alcoholic cirrhosis the extent of hepatic uptake of sex steroids depends partly on the degree of liver function impairment and partly on the degree to which they are bound to sex hormone binding globulin. Production rate or peripheral metabolism, or both, rather than hepatic uptake alone may account for the altered circulating levels of sex steroids.",

Cirrhotic patients were categorized into two groups, with and without \"hepatitis\" using a criteria to define \"hepatitis\" that included only degrees of inflammation, necrosis, and Mallory bodies that had a prognostic weight in terms of mortality in 1 yr. This classification resulted in a sharp separation between a group of 42 patients with cirrhosis without \"hepatitis\" and with low mortality, both at 1 yr (7.1% +/- 4.0%) and at 5 yr (31% +/- 7%), and another group of 98 patients with cirrhosis and \"hepatitis\" and a high mortality both at 1 yr (26.5% +/- 4.5%, p less than 0.01), and at 5 yr (47% +/- 5%, p less than 0.02). Importantly, the 1-yr mortality in patients with cirrhosis and no \"hepatitis\" was not statistically different from that of patients with no cirrhosis or \"hepatitis\" (most of whom had only fatty liver) both at 1 yr (6.9% +/- 3.3%) and at 5 yr (24% +/- 6%). There were marked differences in several variables between cirrhosis with and without \"hepatitis\" [combined clinical and laboratory index: no \"hepatitis\": 4.9 +/- 0.7, with \"hepatitis\": 7.8 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01; score of collagen in space of Disse: no \"hepatitis\": 2.1 +/- 0.4, with \"hepatitis\": 3.7 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.01; hepatocyte cross-sectional surface area: no \"hepatitis\": 682 +/- 51 micron 2, with \"hepatitis\": 841 +/- 31 micron 2, p less than 0.01]. These findings were more severe in the transjugular group than in the percutaneous group.

Selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease. Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment. Remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). Major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment (59% vs. 29%, p less than 0.05). We conclude that 50% of patients who enter remission during initial therapy may ultimately achieve a sustained remission, especially if their disease is of short duration and adequately suppressed during treatment. Relapse does not affect long-term prognosis, but retreatment is associated with more side effects.",

Evidence for the presence of estrogen and androgen receptors was made apparent by high concentrations of silver grains over the nuclei of the cells of these tissues. Androgen receptors were largely confined to the nuclei of the smooth muscle cells of the tunica muscularis of the gut wall and the connective tissue interstitial cells of the liver, pancreas, stomach, and intestines. Estrogen receptors were prominent in the nuclei of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the liver, pancreas, gut, and the majority of the endocrine islet cells.

These established methods were then compared with estimates of total colonic and segmental transits based on a single abdominal film, taken on the fourth day. The single-film technique correlated well with values obtained from the previous, but more inconvenient, methods. Using the simpler approach, colonic transit was assessed in 49 additional healthy subjects, for a total group of 73. Total colonic transit was 35.0 +/- 2.1 h (mean +/- SE); segmental transits was 11.3 +/- 1.1 h for the right colon, 11.4 +/- 1.4 h for the left colon, and 12.4 +/- 1.1 h for the rectosigmoid. Men had significantly shorter transits for the whole colon than did women (p less than 0.05), and this difference was apparent to some extent in the right (p = 0.06) and left colon (p = 0.07) but not in the rectosigmoid. Age did not influence transit significantly nor did a small dose of supplemental fiber. The technique is simple, convenient for clinical usage, and reduces the exposure to radiation to acceptable levels. There should be a role for this approach in the evaluation of colonic transit in selected patients.",

To determine the pattern of colonic blood flow in vivo and the role of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, immune complex-mediated colitis and delayed hypersensitivity-mediated colitis were induced in rabbits. Organ blood flow was determined in conscious animals by radiolabeled microspheres before and after cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthetase inhibition. Colonic blood flow was twofold higher in colitis than in control animals. Thromboxane synthetase inhibition with dazoxiben caused a slight further increase of colon perfusion in animals with colitis, but thromboxane receptor blockade had no effect. Prostaglandin inhibition with indomethacin and ibuprofen did not affect blood flow in controls, but in animals with colitis these drugs markedly reduced colonic blood flow to the level of control animals. The data demonstrate that vasodilatory prostaglandins enhance colonic blood flow in acute colon inflammation.",

To determine when M cells first appear, when they first transport reovirus, and if reovirus adheres to and is endocytosed by other epithelial cells in the first postnatal week, we examined neonatal mouse intestine by transmission electron microscopy after reovirus type 1 exposure. At 2 days M cells accounted for 0.9% of dome epithelial cells. By 9 days M cells had increased to 7.4%. Reovirus type 1 adherence to the surface of villus and dome epithelial cells showed marked variation in 2-6-day-old animals, but by 7 days only a few absorptive cell profiles had adherent reovirus. Adherence to greater than 50% of M-cell profiles occurred in all but 2 animals, but adherence to the majority of Peyer's patch absorptive cell profiles was present only in some 4- and 5-day-old animals. Adherence to a majority of undifferentiated cell profiles occurred in some animals at all ages. Membranous epithelial cells endocytosed reovirus at all ages but only at 2 days did rare villus and dome absorptive cells endocytose reovirus into the apical cytoplasm. Thus, adherence of reovirus to the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells is nonselective in newborn mice but becomes more selective within the first postnatal week with adherence by day 7 to most M-cell profiles, to a substantial but variable number of undifferentiated cell profiles, but to few absorptive cell profiles.",

Fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum, the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals (i.e., mismatched sensory input). An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness.

We studied oesophageal motor activity in 30 consecutive patients meeting standard diagnostic criteria for primary anorexia nervosa (Feighner et al; DSM III). Seven were found to suffer from achalasia instead of primary anorexia nervosa, one from diffuse oesophageal spasm and one from severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and upper oesophageal sphincter hypertonicity, while partly non-propulsive and repetitive high amplitude, long duration contractions prevailed in the lower oesophagus of another six. In four patients with oesophageal dysmotility not responding to therapy and in 12 of 15 patients with normal oesophageal manometry, gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied. Emptying was normal in only three but markedly delayed in 13 cases (half emptying times 97-330 min, median: 147 min, as compared with 21-119 min, median: 47 min, in 24 healthy controls). In eight patients, the effects of domperidone 10 mg iv and placebo were compared under random double blind conditions. Half emptying times were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01) by domperidone. Conclusions: symptoms of disordered upper gastrointestinal motor activity may be mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa; clinical evaluation of patients with presumed primary anorexia nervosa should rule out the possibility that disordered oesophageal motor activity underlies the symptoms; delayed gastric emptying is a frequent feature in primary anorexia nervosa and might be returned to normal with domperidone.",

Ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring showed clearly abnormal reflux in 11 of 22 patients (50%). Nine patients had macroscopic endoscopic changes and a further 11 biopsy changes alone, of oesophagitis which was thus present in 80% overall. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly less in irritable bowel patients than in age and sex matched controls, but upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was comparable in the two groups and disordered peristalsis was not found. Oesophageal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome are mainly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux predisposed to by a subnormal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, rather than by oesophageal spasm.",

Sham feeding induced a significant increase in gastric acid secretion from 1.29 to 7.73 mmol/h (p less than 0.02). Jejunal absorption of water decreased significantly from 41.0 to 26.8 ml/30cm/h (p less than 0.02), sodium from 2.60 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.05, and chloride from 2.68 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.02). During the hour after sham feeding gastric acid secretion and jejunal absorption returned towards basal values. These results suggest that vagal stimulation may have influenced jejunal absorption of salt and water in man and supports the possibility that the autonomic nervous system has a physiological role in the control of intestinal mucosal function.",

Fructose absorption was quantified with lactulose standards. Significant hydrogen production (greater than or equal to 20 ppm rise of breath hydrogen) was found after challenge with 10% solutions of 50, 37.5, 25, 20, and 15 g fructose in eight, seven, five, four and one subjects, respectively. One subject showed malabsorption after a 10 g dose and possibly also 5 g fructose. In contrast, no malabsorption could be detected in any of the 10 subjects after ingestion of 100 g, 75 g, or 50 g sucrose or a mixture of 50 g glucose and 50 g fructose. After ingestion of mixtures of 50 g fructose +25 g glucose and 50 g fructose +12.5 g glucose malabsorption was present in three and seven subjects, respectively. Symptoms during all challenges were mild, or absent. It is concluded that in the healthy state the absorption capacity of fructose given alone ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g. The absorption capacity of fructose given as sucrose is much higher. Glucose stimulates fructose uptake in a dose dependent fashion. The possible existence of more than one intestinal transport system for fructose is considered. The elucidation of the clinical relevance of the findings is important.",

Metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole concentrations fell as the diarrhoea improved and neither substance was detectable in the faeces of five patients after recovery.

Thirty eight of these lesions were neoplastic, but the remaining 11 patients had inflammatory non-neoplastic lesions (pseudotumours). These could not be distinguished from the neoplasms on endoscopic appearances. The cholangiopancreatograms were similar except that the diameter of the pancreatic duct tended to be higher in the tumour group and gall stones were present significantly more often in the patients with pseudotumour. Endoscopic biopsy correctly diagnosed 28 of 34 ampullary carcinomas. Two of the 11 pseudotumour patients were subjected to surgical excision biopsy because of suspicious histological features of endoscopic biopsy. In the neoplastic group 19 patients underwent Whipple's procedure, seven surgical bypass, seven endoscopic sphincterotomy only and five died without successful biliary drainage. The overall one year survival was 44.7%. By contrast, the patients with pseudotumours were clinically well at a median follow up 24 months (range 12-41 months), after endoscopic sphincterotomy except for one 89 year old patient who died 22 months later from unrelated causes.",

In these patients, we observed an endoscopic aspect, consisting of multiple small erythematous areas, outlined by a subtle yellowish network (resembling a mosaic), mainly located in the proximal part of the stomach. We tested the value of this sign by comparing two groups: 100 patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, and 300 control patients without signs of liver disease or portal hypertension. This endoscopic pattern was observed in 94 of the patients with cirrhosis, whereas oesophageal varices were seen in 78 only. In contrast, only one patient of the control group had this aspect. Moreover, this sign was also found in seven of eight patients with non cirrhotic portal hypertension, but was seen neither in 100 patients with chronic alcoholism but without liver disease, nor in 10 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts. These endoscopic changes might be because of mucosal and/or submucosal oedema and congestion highlighting the normal areae gastricae pattern and related to raised portal pressure. We conclude that the mosaic pattern of the gastric mucosa is a sensible and specific sign for diagnosis of portal hypertension, whatever the cause.",

In patients of group A, cardiac index was significantly lower than that of group C and systemic vascular resistance was higher, but not significantly so, than that of patients with liver failure. Wedged hepatic venous pressure was significantly lower in the former group than in the latter. In patients in group B, corresponding values fell between those of groups A and C. Azygos blood flow averaged 0.477 +/- 0.242 l/min (mean +/- SD) in group A and it was significantly lower than in groups B and C (0.642 +/- 0.224 and 1.061 +/- 0.476 l/min, respectively). In the three groups, acute administration of propranolol induced statistically significant changes in systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics. In patients of group C but not of group B, the mean value of azygos blood flow after propranolol remained significantly higher than in group A. Moreover, the fraction of azygos blood flow to cardiac output decreased in groups A and B while slightly increased in group C. This study shows that in patients with cirrhosis, the degree of liver failure may be a determinant for the haemodynamic responses to drugs acting on portal hypertension.",

Using the extent of acid secreting areas gastric ulcers were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. Duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid secreting areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers, and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers with extensive acid secreting areas when compared with placebo, but not of the gastric ulcers without extensive acid secreting areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid secreting areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but has little or no influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers associated with low acid secretion.",

Other areas reviewed included artificial cells containing enzymes, multienzymes, immunosorbents, cell cultures and other areas. Artificial cells can be formed as membrane coated adsorbent or microencapsulated adsorbent, enzymes and cells. The large surface to volume relationship and the ultrathin membrane of artificial cells allows the rapid equilibration of metabolites. Artificial cells containing enzymes, ion exchange resin and activated charcoal have been used for hemoperfusion. The microencapsulated or membrane coated absorbents, enzymes, cells, immunosorbents and other material are prevented from releasing unwanted material into the circulation and prevented from adverse effects on blood cells. Because of the problem of charcoal in releasing emboli and depleting platelets we first developed coated activated charcoal hemoperfusion for clinical application. This has been used extensively in clinical studies. The artificial cell approach has also been applied to a number of other hemoperfusion approaches. The lack of space only allows this paper to summarize some of the approaches originated from this research centre.",

First, a structural model with mathematical description of the different diffusion steps was developed. Exact quantification appeared very difficult, resulting in insufficient fit of predicted and measured concentration curves. Moreover, the mathematics turned out simple, since the concentration courses could be described with one exponential power. Therefore, a formal model was developed, assuming linear isotherms and adsorption, proportional to the average concentration in the column. With this model predicted in-vitro inlet and outlet concentrations could be fitted to the measured data accurately. A relation between both models is given under the condition of high intraparticle mass transfer, which is allowed in case of powder adsorbents. It can be concluded that structural models do not yield predictive tools for optimization of device geometry. A formal model with two constants determining device performance enables device optimization with the help of some in-vitro experiments.",

Limitations of plasma exchange, however, exist. Membrane plasma filtration provides a practical alternative. Solute removal can be made selective by the choice of operating conditions as temperature and the selection of the membrane/module design. The optimal temperature range is a function of the plasma type, solute concentrations and membrane system. Operation at below physiologic temperature (cryofiltration) is particularly suited for the removal of cold aggregative solutes, while operation at near or above physiologic temperature is more suited for the separation of solutes having large size differences at normal physiologic temperature. Membrane filtration is simple and safe to perform, is more selective than plasma exchange, does not require plasma product infusion and is more versatile than selective sorption in its applications.",

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve.",

Most have interpreted this to be a product of decreasing central nervous system sensitivity to the normal stimuli that maintain ventilation, whereas other factors such as increasing airflow resistance could also contribute to this reduction in respiration. To improve our understanding of these events, we measured ventilation and occlusion pressures (P0.1) during unstimulated ventilation and rebreathing-induced hypercapnia during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Eighteen subjects (10 males and 8 females) of whom seven were snorers (5 males and 2 females) were studied. Ventilation was reduced during both NREM and REM sleep (P less than 0.05), but this decrement in minute ventilation tended to be greater in snorers than nonsnorers. Unstimulated P0.1, on the other hand, was maintained or increased during sleep in all groups studied, with males and snorers showing the largest increase. The hypercapnic ventilatory response fell during both NREM and REM sleep and tended to be lower during REM than NREM sleep. However, the P0.1 response to hypercapnia during NREM sleep was well maintained at the waking level although the REM response was statistically reduced. These studies suggest that the mechanism of the reduction in ventilation and the hypercapnic ventilatory response seen during sleep, particularly NREM sleep, is likely to be multifactorial and not totally a product of decreasing central respiratory drive.",

            "input": "Abstract: Respiration in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) is known to be highly variable. The purpose of this study was to investigate the source of this variability and to determine which ordering principles remained operative in REM sleep. In unrestrained, naturally sleeping cats we recorded the electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, neck electromyogram, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) and computed its moving average (MAdi). As a reference, we first examined MAdi during \"tonic\" REMS, since breathing is fairly regular in this state. \"Control\" ranges for peak amplitude (PEMG), inspiratory time (TI), duration of postinspiratory inspiratory activity, expiratory time, and the calculated inspiratory slope (PEMG/TI) were determined by overlaying individual breath traces of the time course of MAdi during tonic REMS to form a composite tracing. Next, the time course of the EMG during individual breaths in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and a complete period of consecutive breaths in REMS (both tonic and phasic) were compared with this tonic REMS composite. The number of eye movements per breath was tabulated as an index of phasic activity. The inspiratory slopes during SWS and tonic REMS were similar. However, during phasic REMS, many breaths displayed either increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) in slope compared with the \"typical\" breaths seen in tonic REMS. The occurrence of these altered slopes increased with the frequency of phasic events. TI was inversely related to the slope of the EMG, which tended to minimize changes in PEMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Lipolytic activity in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats was enhanced in response to 1 microM isoproterenol and 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP but not in adipocytes from trained SHR. Decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated (1 microM) cAMP accumulation were evident in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats but not in adipocytes from trained SHR. Basal and agonist-induced lipolysis in fat cells isolated from both normotensive rats and SHR immediately following a 60-min run was increased in both sedentary and trained rats. Adenylate cyclase activity in fat cell membranes was blunted in sedentary and trained SHR both in the absence and presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylyl imidophosphate. No apparent differences existed in antagonist affinity of binding sites for the antagonist dihydroalprenolol in normal rats or SHR. Evidence for a change in affinity of agonist isoproterenol might be indicated based on the enhanced potency of isoproterenol to stimulate lipolysis in trained normal rats. beta-Adrenergic receptor density and antagonist affinity were not different in normotensive rats and SHR in response to training. However, displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in adipocytes from SHR required greater concentrations of isoproterenol compared with adipocytes from normotensive rats, further suggestive of increased agonist affinity of binding sites in normal rats. These data suggest a postreceptor lesion of the lipolytic pathway in adipocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats, possibly at the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Both total breath iEMG and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) increased, remained at a high level for a certain period of time, and then started to fall. A change in the pattern of iEMG within a breath was observed during loaded breathing. The increase in total-breath iEMG was associated mostly with an increase in iEMG3, or the last part of the EMG power within each inspiration. Similarly, the decrease in total breath iEMG was primarily due to a decrease in iEMG3. We conclude that, in sheep subjected to severe IFR loads for prolonged periods the marked increase in total-breath iEMG at the beginning of loaded breathing and the marked decrease in this iEMG at the time of decrease in Pdi are largely due to changes in iEMG that occur during the latter third of each breath. We speculate that during loaded breathing the recruitment pattern of diaphragmatic muscle fibers changes during the course of an inspiratory effort.",

We have studied the effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS), exogenous VIP, and isoproterenol (Iso) on human airways in vitro. We have also studied a related peptide, peptide histidine methionine (PHM), which coexists with VIP in human airway nerves, and in separate experiments studied fragments of the VIP amino acid sequence (VIP1-10 and VIP16-28) for agonist and antagonist activity. Human airways were obtained at thoracotomy and studied in an organ bath. In bronchi EFS gave an inhibitory response that was unaltered by 10(-6) M propranolol but was blocked by tetrodotoxin, whereas in bronchioles there was little or no nonadrenergic inhibitory response. VIP, PHM, and Iso all caused dose-dependent relaxation of bronchi, VIP and PHM being approximately 50-fold more potent than Iso. VIP, but not Iso, mimicked the time course of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation. In contrast bronchioles relaxed to Iso but not to VIP or PHM. Neither propranolol nor indomethacin altered the relaxant effects of VIP or PHM, suggesting a direct effect of these peptides on airway smooth muscle. Neither of the VIP fragments showed either agonist or antagonist activity. We conclude that VIP and PHM are more potent bronchodilators of human bronchi than Iso and that the association between the relaxant effects of these peptides and nonadrenergic inhibitory responses suggests that they may be possible neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways.",

            "input": "Abstract: Newborn rats were maintained in an hypoxic chamber (10% O2 in N2) from the day of birth up to 2 wk of postnatal life. Body weight (BW) and nose-tail length were less in the hypoxic exposed (H) rats than in control (C) animals growing in air. Hematocrit rose from about 37% to about 51%. Oxygen consumption (VO2), measured with a manometric method, was lower in H than in C rats; the difference remained at 5-7 days even after normalization by BW. At 5-7 days ventilation, measured with an airflow plethysmograph, was much more elevated in H rats (whether breathing 10% O2 or air) than in C rats, with an increase in both tidal volume and frequency. This indicates that the biphasic ventilatory response, characterized by an initial rise and then a fall of ventilation toward normoxic values, commonly observed in newborns during acute hypoxic challenge is an immediate but only transient response. The dry lung weight-to-BW ratio and alveolar size were larger in H than in C rats. Lung volumes at 20 cmH2O were similar, despite the smaller BW of the H rats. Hence, in the rat, chronic hypoxia in the immediate postnatal period increases O2-carrying capacity, decreases metabolic demands, increases alveolar O2 availability, and promotes structural changes in the lung that protect the gas exchange area and optimize the structure-function relationship of the lung. These results may also suggest that the lung structural alterations with chronic hypoxia should not be attributed to changes in VO2 but, eventually, to the ventilatory action of the organ.",

Therefore, in chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed dogs, we recorded airflow, airway pressure, arterial pressure, and heart rate while electrically stimulating a phrenic nerve. Total lung resistance was calculated breath by breath. The phrenic nerve was stimulated at 3, 5, 20, 70, 140, and 200 times motor threshold and the compound action potential was recorded. Stimulation of the phrenic nerve at three and five times threshold, which activated groups I, II, and a few group III fibers, had no effect on any of the variables measured. Stimulation at 20 times threshold, which activated many group III fibers and groups I and II fibers, reflexly decreased resistance. Stimulation at 70, 140, and 200 times threshold, which activated groups I-IV fibers, evoked progressively greater decreases in lung resistance. The reflex bronchodilation evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation was unaffected by propranolol or phentolamine but was abolished by atropine. We conclude that activation of groups III and IV phrenic nerve afferents reflexly decreased total lung resistance by withdrawing cholinergic tone to airway smooth muscle.",

Anemia was induced in nine healthy male subjects by repeated venesections. The stored blood was retransfused after 9 wk (range 8-11 wk). Exercise tests were performed before venesection in the control state (C), in the anemic state (A), and 48 h after retransfusion (R). Hemoglobin concentration levels were 146 +/- 10 g/l in C, 110 +/- 7 g/l in A, and 145 +/- 9 g/l in R. Maximal O2 uptake was 4.55 +/- 0.6, 3.74 +/- 0.7, and 4.45 +/- 0.6 l/min in C, A, and R, respectively. A decrease in heart rate of 7 beats/min (P less than 0.01) and in cardiac output of 2 l/min (P less than 0.05) at maximal exercise occurred in the anemic state compared with control values. These decreases were not reversed but, rather, were further accentuated after retransfusion. The adaptive response to submaximal exercise (cycling at 150-175 W) in anemia was mediated to the amount of 50% by an increase in cardiac output (mainly an increase in heart rate) and 50% was due to increased O2 extraction in the peripheral tissue. In conclusion, long-term anemia was found to decrease the heart rate and cardiac output at maximal exercise. Furthermore the close correlation between hemoglobin concentration and maximal O2 uptake in humans is confirmed.",

The equation is reexpressed in currently accepted terminology, and it is shown that the equation serves well as a basic model of normal walking. Employing this model to analyze VO2/step leads to the elaboration of a three-compartment model of the metabolic cost of walking. This three-compartment model provides a rational estimate of the fraction of walking's metabolic cost that powers the actual walking movement. Doubt is expressed that \"comfortable speed of walking\" is definable in energy terms. It is suggested that the requirements of maintaining balance while walking may determine both the comfortable speed of walking and the curvilinearity of the relationship between ground-speed and freely chosen step frequency of walking.",

Because of the cellular complexity of the airways, receptor characterization in whole tissue is unfeasible. Therefore, we utilized homogenates of disaggregated gland cells isolated from cat trachea and the muscarinic antagonist [1-3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to characterize glandular muscarinic receptors. Receptors of isolated cells were functionally intact as assessed by carbachol (10(-4) M) stimulation of O2 consumption 86 +/- 6% (+/- SE, n = 20). Stimulation was dose dependent (mean effective concentration = 3.5 microM), inhibited by atropine [dissociation constant (KD) = 4.2 nM] but not phentolamine nor propranolol. Specific binding of [3H]QNB to cell homogenates was saturable, of high affinity (KD = 36 pM) and to a single population of receptors. Maximum binding was 58 fmol/10(6) cells or about 35,000 receptors per cell. Estimated affinities for muscarinic agents were in the micromolar range for agonists and nanomolar range for antagonists. Histamine, alpha-adrenergic, and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists did not inhibit specific binding. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors on tracheal gland cells are of high affinity and density.",

The permeability-surface area of urea was calculated from multiple indicator dilution curves using two separate injectates for each hematocrit level. One injectate contained only 125I-albumin as the vascular reference tracer and the other contained both 51Cr-erythrocytes and 125I-albumin as the vascular reference tracers; both contained [14C]urea as the permeating tracer. The results strongly indicate that the phenomenon of \"erythrocyte trapping\" of urea does not affect the calculation of urea permeability-surface area product provided the appropriate albumin-erythrocyte composite reference tracer is utilized in its calculation.",

            "input": "Abstract: Ethane washout during low tidal volume (25-100 ml) high-frequency (3-40 Hz) ventilation (HFV) was studied in seven excised dog lungs. The lungs were initially equilibrated with 1% ethane, and then the concentration of ethane was monitored by mass spectrometry from multiple anatomic sites along the tracheobronchial tree during washout. We observed that the lung changed from a uniform distribution of ethane concentrations to a nonuniform distribution by a three-phase process. The first phase was nearly complete within the first 15 s and probably corresponds to concentration gradients being established in the central airways. During the second phase of washout, which lasted for several minutes, the concentrations in the various alveolar regions diverged. In the final phase, the regional concentrations remained at fixed ratios, and washout from all sites in the lung was at a constant fractional rate. These data are consistent with a model in which the duration of the second phase and the magnitude of the regional concentration differences established in this phase are dependent on both the magnitude of differences between regional transport paths and the nature of regional coupling by a common transport path to the airway opening.",

Inspiratory pressures were measured with an esophageal balloon catheter and three catheters located at different sites along the upper airway: supralaryngeal airway, oropharynx, and nasopharynx. Peak inspiratory pressure differences between catheters allowed assessment of pressure gradients across three airway segments: lungs-larynx-retroepiglottal airway (esophageal-supralaryngeal pressure), hypopharynx (supralaryngeal-oropharynx pressure), and transpalatal airway (oropharynx-nasopharynx pressure). In five patients, hypopharyngeal obstruction was present, and in four patients no hypopharyngeal obstruction existed. In these four patients the site of obstruction was located at the level of the palate. In a given subject, the site of obstruction was the same during repeated measurements. The presence or absence of hypopharyngeal narrowing during sleep was not predictable from gradients measured across different segments of the upper airway during wakefulness. We conclude that the site of physiological upper airway obstruction varies among patients with obstructive sleep apnea and is not predictable from pressure measured during wakefulness. We speculate that uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may not relieve obstructive apneas in patients with hypopharyngeal obstruction.",

Six men and one woman (age 23-46 yr) underwent 45 min of standing immersion to the neck preceded by 45-min standing without immersion, first dehydrated, and then 105 min later after rehydration with water. Immersion caused an isotonic expansion of the plasma volume (P less than 0.001), which occurred independently of hydration status. Suppression of PRA (P less than 0.001) and PA (P less than 0.001) during both immersions also occurred independently of hydration status. Suppression of plasma vasopressin was observed during dehydrated immersion (P less than 0.001) but not during rehydrated immersion. It is concluded that plasma tonicity is not a factor influencing PVP suppression during water immersion.",

In addition to standard polysomnography for sleep staging and respiratory pattern monitoring, esophageal pressure, tidal volume (VT), and airflow were measured via an esophageal catheter and pneumotachograph, respectively, with the latter attached to a tight-fitting face mask, allowing calculation of total pulmonary system resistance (Rp). During stage I/II NREM sleep minimal period breathing was evident in two of the subjects; however, in four subjects during hypoxia and/or relief from hypoxia, with and without added resistance, pronounced periodic breathing developed with waxing and waning of VT, sometimes with apneic phases. Resistive loading without hypoxia did not cause periodicity. At the nadir of periodic changes in VT, Rp was usually at its highest and there was a significant linear relationship between Rp and 1/VT, indicating the development of obstructive hypopneas. In one subject without added resistance and in the same subject and in another during resistive loading, upper airway obstruction at the nadir of the periodic fluctuations in VT was observed. We conclude that periodic breathing resulting in periodic diminution of upper airway muscle activity is associated with increased upper airway resistance that predisposes upper airways to collapse.",

Peak diaphragmatic activity (EMGdi) had a curvilinear relationship with TI during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that TI shortened as EMGdi decreased during the ventilatory phase (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05) and it prolonged as EMGdi increased during the occlusive phase (r = 0.89, P less than 0.02). However, EMGdi vs. TI for the occlusive phase was shifted to the right of that for the ventilatory phase, reflecting the relatively longer TI during upper airway occlusion. TI also had a linear relationship with pleural pressure (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001) that remained unchanged during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that it prolonged as negative inspiratory pressure increased. These results indicate that respiratory timing is continuously modified in patients with occlusive apnea as inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during NREM sleep and suggest that this modification is due to the net effects of changing inspiratory neural drive and afferent input predominantly from upper airway mechanoreceptors.",

The different modulations observed are discussed in respect to vagal components of the epithelial layer. Responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium, which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions. This prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, whereas substance P induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea. Serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations, which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists. A relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized, possibly dependent on substance P-ergic innervation. Muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses, independently on the presence of the epithelial layer. 4-Aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin, which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade. Epithelial-dependent contracting and relaxing factors are thus suggested in rat trachea.",

[3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown. The [14C]glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats.",

Airway responsiveness to antigen and histamine was characterized by the doses that increased the airflow resistance of the total respiratory system to twice the control values (ED200). Highly significant correlations were found between airway responsiveness and cutaneous responsiveness to antigen and other immunologic characteristics (e.g., IgE and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) in all dogs. In ragweed-sensitized dogs, there was an inverse correlation between immunologic responsiveness (reflected by the cutaneous response to antigen and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) and nonimmunologic responsiveness of airways (histamine ED200: r = 0.73, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.75, P less than 0.01, respectively). Antigen ED200 was also correlated with histamine release from lung after antigen inhalation (r = 0.74; P less than 0.01).

In 4 divers, rectal (Tre) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures and rate of O2 consumption (VO2) were measured during diving work in summer (27 degrees C water) and winter (14 degrees C water). Thermal insulation and energy costs of diving work were estimated. In summer, comparisons were made of subjects clad either in wet suits (protected) or in swimming trunks (unprotected), and in winter, they wore wet suits. The average Tre in unprotected divers decreased to 36.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C at the end of 1-h diving work, but in protected divers it decreased to 37.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C in 2 h in summer and to 36.9 +/- 0.1 degree C in 1.5 h in winter. The average Tsk of unprotected divers decreased to 28.0 +/- 0.6 degrees C in summer and that of protected divers decreased to 32.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C in summer and 28.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C in winter. Average VO2 increased 190% (from 370 ml/min before diving to 1,070 ml/min) in unprotected divers in summer, but in protected divers it rose 120% (from 360 to 780 ml/min) in summer and 110% (from 330 to 690 ml/min) in winter.

These earlier approaches suffer from several drawbacks: useful information about the relationships between the error components in a closed-loop system is not fully utilized; the response intercept cannot be directly estimated; and the normalization procedure required in some methods may fail under certain circumstances. This paper proposes a new, general method of simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data when the errors in both variables are specifically related by the system structure. A direct extension of the least-squares approach, this method [directed least squares (DLS)] reduces to ordinary least-squares methods when either of the measured variables is error free and to the reduced-major-axis (RMA) method of Kermack and Haldane (Biometrics 37: 30-41, 1950) when the magnitudes of the normalized errors are equal. The DLS estimators are scale invariant, statistically unbiased and always assume the minimum variance. With simple modifications, the method is also applicable to paired data. If, however, the relation between error components is uncertain, then the RMA method is optimal, i.e., having the least possible asymptotic bias and variance. These results are illustrated by using various types of closed-loop respiratory response data.",

This could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction. It was associated with increased velocity of shortening. We now report that, by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system, quick releases were applied to control and sensitized TSM at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction. From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening. It is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early, rapidly cycling bridges. The bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles.",

The locations were identified with respect to the innervation zone and the tendonous portion of the tibialis anterior muscle. Considerable modifications in the median frequency and conduction velocity parameters were noted. The highest values of the median frequency occurred at the region of the innervation zone and tendonous insertion of the muscle, and decreased proportionally with distance from these areas. The rate of change of median frequency was not effected by electrode location. Estimates of conduction velocity were most stable in a region between the distal tendon and the adjacent innervation zone. This region also provided the best linear fit when comparing conduction velocity to median frequency estimates. The implications for signal detection procedures are discussed.",

At present, no report of a direct comparison of the relative merits of these techniques has been made. Authorities in favor of trunk-only bath rewarming base their proposal on the assumption that core temperature afterdrop would be minimized by preventing peripheral vasodilation when the subject's limbs are not immersed in the rewarming bath. In the present study, trunk-only and whole-body bath rewarming are compared by rewarming eight mildly hypothermic male subjects twice, once via each technique. It was concluded that trunk-only rewarming is not superior to whole-body bath rewarming as a therapy for mild immersion hypothermia, based on the findings that no significant differences existed between the two techniques, either in size or duration of core temperature afterdrop, or in rate of rewarming.",

Respiratory air flow, esophageal pressure, and intramuscular GG electromyograms (EMG) were recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Both tonic and phasic inspiratory GG-EMG activity was recorded in each of the infants. On occasion, no phasic GG activity could be recorded; these silent periods were unassociated with respiratory embarrassment. GG activity increased during sigh breaths. GG activity also increased when the infants spontaneously changed from oral to nasal breathing and, in two infants, with neck flexion associated with complete upper airway obstruction, suggesting that GG-EMG activity is influenced by sudden changes in upper airway resistance. During sleep, the GG-EMG activity significantly increased with 5% CO2 breathing (P less than or equal to 0.001). With nasal airway occlusion during sleep, the GG-EMG activity increased with the first occluded breath and progressively increased during the subsequent occluded breaths, indicating mechanoreceptor and suggesting chemoreceptor modulation. During nasal occlusion trials, there was a progressive increase in phasic inspiratory activity of the GG-EMG that was greater than that of the diaphragm activity (as reflected by esophageal pressure excursions). When pharyngeal airway closure occurred during a nasal occlusion trial, the negative pressure at which the pharyngeal airway closed (upper airway closing pressure) correlated with the GG-EMG activity at the time of closure, suggesting that the GG muscle contributes to maintaining pharyngeal airway patency in the micrognathic infant.",

Although the most common symptom is pain in the skeletal joints, no direct study of nitrogen exchange in this region has been undertaken. For this study, nitrogen tagged with radioactive 13N was prepared in a linear accelerator. Nine human subjects rebreathed this gas from a closed circuit for 30 min, then completed a 40- to 100-min washout period breathing room air. The isotope 13N was monitored continuously in the subject's knee during the entire period using positron detectors. After correction for isotope decay (half-life = 9.96 min), the concentration in most knees continued to rise for at least 30 min into the washout period. Various causes of this unexpected result are discussed, the most likely of which is an extensive redistribution of gas within avascular knee tissues.",

Exercise training resulted in a significant increase in the mean specific activity of cyclic AMP-PDE (pmol X min-1 X mg-1) from the whole homogenate and S48 fraction at cyclic AMP concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 microM and in the P48 fraction at 8 and 16 microM cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP-PDE kinetic plots according to Lineweaver-Burk for the calculation of Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax) were nonlinear, indicating both a low and high enzyme form. The Michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high Km form of cyclic AMP-PDE in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low Km form of the P5 particulate fraction. The Vmax of the high Km form of the P48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control. Phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals. These changes in specific activity, Michaelis constants, and Vmax of cyclic AMP-PDE from crude homogenates of isolated fat cells from exercise trained animals may account for the decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP following catecholamine stimulation of isolated fat cells from trained rats.",

We were interested in whether, and to what extent, Tar-Tre differences could lead to errors in arterial blood gas corrections. At control environmental temperatures (Ta) of 5 degrees C in the winter and 21 degrees C in the summer, Tar and Tre (37.1 degrees C) did not differ (P greater than 0.05). Elevating winter or summer Ta by 10-18 degrees C for 2-days or lowering summer Ta by 9 degrees C (2-days) did not change Tar or Tre (P greater than 0.05). Furthermore, elevating inspired PCO2 to 42 Torr for 15 min did not alter Tar or Tre from control (P greater than 0.05). During treadmill exercise, at 1.8 mph 5% grade, Tar and Tre did not change significantly (P greater than 0.05) from rest by 11 min of work. At 3 mph 5% grade, Tar increased progressively by 0.3 degrees C (P less than 0.05) while Tre tended to increase 0.1 degree C by 11 min.

Finally, by 6 min of heavy exercise at 8 mph 20% grade, Tar increased 2 degrees C (P less than 0.05) while Tre increased 0.5 degree C (P less than 0.05).

This behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia, with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees C, usually to a new, steady level. Both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of N2O or N2 used. The effects of N2O on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible. There was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation, suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia. Since both gases elicited changes in behavioral thermoregulation promoting rather than opposing the onset of hypothermia, it is concluded that they may have acted to lower the level at which deep body temperature was being regulated.",

Since systemic venous pressure (SVP) must be overcome before pulmonary lymph can flow, variations in SVP may affect lymph flow rate and therefore the rate of fluid accumulation within the lung. The importance of this issue is evident when one considers the variety of clinical interventions that increase SVP and promote pulmonary edema formation, such as volume infusion, positive-pressure ventilation, and various vasoactive drug therapies. We recorded pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), left atrial pressure (LAP), and SVP in chronic unanesthetized sheep. Occlusion balloons were placed in the left atrium and superior vena cava to control their respective pressures. The superior vena caval occluder was placed above the azygos vein so that bronchial venous pressure would not be elevated when the balloon was inflated. Three-hour experiments were carried out at various LAP levels with and without SVP being elevated to 20 mmHg. The amount of fluid present in the lung was determined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio method. At control LAP levels, no significant difference in lung fluid accumulation could be shown between animals with control and elevated SVP levels. When LAP was elevated above control a significantly greater amount of pulmonary fluid accumulated in animals with elevated SVP levels compared with those with control SVP levels. We conclude that significant excess pulmonary edema formation will occur when SVP is elevated at pulmonary microvascular pressures not normally associated with rapid fluid accumulation.",

The average active elastance and resistance of the respiratory system were, respectively, 64.0 cmH2O X l-1 and 5.4 cmH2O X l-1 X s.

To test this \"rate-of-living theory\" we examined the effect of raising energy expenditure by means of cold exposure on the longevity of rats. Male 6-mo-old SPF Long-Evans rats were gradually accustomed to immersion in cool water (23 degrees C). After 3 mo they were standing in the cool water for 4 h/day, 5 days/wk. They were maintained on this program until age 32 mo. The cold exposure resulted in a 44% increase in food intake (P less than 0.001). Despite their greater food intake, the cold-exposed rats' body weights were significantly lower than those of control animals from age 11 to 32 mo. The average age at death of the cold-exposed rats was 968 +/- 141 days compared with 923 +/- 159 days for the controls. The cold exposure appeared to protect against neoplasia, particularly sarcomas; only 24% of the necropsied cold-exposed rats had malignancies compared with 57% for the controls. The results of this study provide no support for the concept that increased energy expenditure decreases longevity.",

With intact vagi, nicotine caused a dose-dependent increase in central airway resistance (Rc) similar to the increase in peripheral airway resistance (Rp) at concentrations ranging from 4 to 64 micrograms/kg. However, the responses of both Rc and Rp fell progressively when sequential doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg were administered. With intact vagi and the administration of propranolol, there was a greater increase in Rp than in Rc at a nicotine dose of 64 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.05). With vagotomy, the responsiveness of both central and peripheral airways to nicotine decreased with doses of nicotine less than 64 micrograms/kg, but with doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg the suppressive effect of nicotine on both Rc and Rp was less than that seen with intact vagi. Under conditions in which the vagi were cut and atropine administered, the responsiveness of nicotine was even further depressed. Combinations either of atropine and chlorpheniramine or atropine and phenoxybenzamine also completely blocked reactions to nicotine. Additionally reactions to nicotine were completely blocked by hexamethonium. These results suggest that nicotine increases both Rc and Rp mainly through a vagal reflex and stimulation of the parasympathetic ganglia.",

Internal temperature (esophageal temperature, Tes), mean skin temperature (Tsk), local chest temperature (Tch), and local chest sweat rate (msw) were continuously recorded. The control of sweating was best described by the slope of the linear relationship between msw and Tes and the threshold Tes for the onset of sweating. The slope of the msw-Tes relationship decreased 27% (P less than 0.01), from 1.80 to 1.30 mg X cm-2 X min-1 X degree C-1 during BB. The Tes threshold for sweating (36.8 degrees C) was not altered as the result of BB. These data suggest that BB modified the control of sweating via some peripheral interaction. Since Tsk was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced during BB exercise, from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees C, we evaluated the influence of the reduction in local skin temperature (Tsk) in the altered control of sweating. Reductions in Tch accounted for only 45% of the decrease in the slope of the msw-Tes relationship during BB. Since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with BB, as estimated from the energy balance equation, was also reduced 18%, compared with control exercise, we concluded that during BB the reduction in sweating at any Tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local Tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland.",

This was done using a technique to simultaneously determine total and perfused regional arteriolar and capillary morphology. Conscious Long-Evans rats served as unbled controls or were bled 65 mmHg or to 40-45 mmHg and stabilized for 30 min. Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using [14C]iodoantipyrine in half of these animals and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was injected in the other half for determination of perfused cerebral microvascular morphometric indexes. The total microvasculature was labeled postmortem via an alkaline phosphatase stain. Regional cerebral blood flow was significantly increased in animals bled to 65 mmHg. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, cerebral blood flow was reduced 50% (from 59 +/- 28 to 26 +/- 11 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, mean +/- SD) with no regional redistribution. For all treatments, total capillary density ranged from 400 to 500 capillaries/mm2, and in controls 47% were perfused. Animals bled to 65 mmHg did not mobilize their unperfused microvascular reserve even though they showed a slight tendency to do so. During hemorrhage to 40-45 mmHg, this percent increased significantly to 57% with the largest increase occurring in the pons. Approximately 51% of arterioles were perfused in controls and this was not different compared with the percent perfused during hemorrhage. Despite the overall lack of mobilization of unperfused arterioles, some regions within the brain significantly mobilized their reserves with severe hemorrhage, e.g., hippocampus (78%), hypothalamus (67%), and medulla (73%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The subjects were 28 young men, 16-18 yr old. Arterial elasticity was evaluated by measuring the carotid to femoral pulse-wave velocity (c) at rest. The slope, S(c) of the relation between c and the diastolic blood pressure was studied during a cold pressor test to test vascular reactivity. The relationship between heart rate (HR) and work load was determined using a cycle ergometer; the variables measured were the slope of this relation S(PWC) and the power output at a HR of 170 min-1 (PWC170). The PWC170 ranged from 1.8 to 4.6 W/kg, and values of c ranged from 3.9 to 6.8 m/s. A strong inverse linear relation was found between c and PWC170 (r = -0.76), whereas the HR at rest was positively related to both c (r = 0.68) and PWC170 (r = 0.74). There was no relationship between HR at rest and the slopes S(c) and S(PWC); the latter two variables depend mainly on the sympathetic response. These results show the importance of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the cardiovascular system, particularly arterial elasticity, in human adaptations to muscular exercise.",

Similar density fluctuations were observed in the blood leaving isolated, perfused lobes of dogs that were ventilated cyclicly. Employing an analysis that balanced the erythrocyte and plasma flows through distensible capillaries containing blood with a tube hematocrit lower than the hematocrit in large blood vessels, we derived a relationship to estimate from the density fluctuation the change in pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc). For mechanical ventilation, the maximum change in density over one ventilation cycle increased from 0.084 +/- 0.01 to 0.47 +/- 0.05 (SE) g/l as the frequency decreased from 29 to 6 cycles/min. These density changes were estimated to be the result of an 1-16% change in Vc. A larger tidal volume for the mechanical ventilation led to a larger density fluctuation. The maximum density change of spontaneous respiration of 6 cycles/min was one-sixth of the mechanical case, indicating a much smaller change in Vc during spontaneous respiration. When the airway flow resistance was increased for spontaneous respiration, larger density fluctuations were observed.",

GH3 cells (10(6)) were subcutaneously injected into 150-g female Wistar-Furth rats to initiate the tumor. After 17 days, the tumor-bearing rats gained 5.7 g body wt/day compared with 2.0 for the nontumor-bearing rats. The left gastrocnemius muscle was surgically removed from both nontumor and tumor groups. The gastrocnemius was removed from the tumor group after an increased growth rate was achieved. Seven days after surgery, the animals were killed and plantaris muscles were removed. The wet weight of the left plantaris muscle increased 45.6 and 44.0% over the unoperated contralateral control (right side) in the nontumor and tumor groups, respectively. The right control plantaris muscle in the tumor group was 63% heavier than the right control plantaris from the nontumor group; however, the proportion of body weight for plantaris was similar between the two groups. The effect of gastrocnemius ablation and tumor treatment on plantaris weight was additive, and the percent increase over the unoperated contralateral control side was similar between the two groups. These data demonstrate that skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs in adult animals in which growth has been stimulated by a growth hormone-secreting tumor and could suggest that the muscle growth response caused by the tumor is operating by a mechanism different than work-induced hypertrophy.",

Rib cage, as well as abdominal, strapping caused a significant decrease in vital capacity (respectively, -36 and -34%), total lung capacity (TLC) (-31 and -27%), functional residual capacity (FRC) (-28 and -28%), and expiratory reserve volume (-40 and -48%) and an increase in specific airway conductance (+24 and +30%) and in maximal expiratory flow at 50% of control TLC (+47 and +42%). The decrease of residual volume (RV) was significant (-12%) with rib cage strapping only. Abdominal strapping resulted in a minor overall increase in Rrs, whereas rib cage strapping produced a more marked increase at low frequencies; thus a frequency dependence of Rrs was induced. A similar pattern, but with lower absolute values, of Rrs was obtained by thoracic strapping when the subject was breathing at control FRC. Xrs was decreased, especially at low frequencies, with abdominal strapping and even more with thoracic strapping; thus the resonant frequency of the respiratory system was shifted toward higher frequencies. Partitioning Rrs and Xrs into resistance and reactance of lungs and chest wall demonstrated that the different effects of chest wall and abdominal strapping on Rrs and Xrs reflect changes mainly of chest wall mechanics.",

Muscle fiber type proportions (I, IIa, and IIb), fiber areas and activities of several enzyme markers of different energy metabolic pathways were determined from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis. Results indicated that Caucasians had a higher percent type I (8%, P less than 0.01) and a lower percent type IIa (6.7%, P less than 0.05) fiber proportions than Africans. No significant differences were observed between the two racial groups in the type IIb fiber proportion or in the three fiber type areas. Enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic [creatine kinase (CK)] and glycolytic [hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] metabolic pathways had significantly higher activities (about 30-40%) in the Black African group than in the Caucasian group (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was noted in the activities of oxidative enzymes [malate dehydrogenase (MDH), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH)]. Consequently, the PFK/OGDH ratio was significantly elevated in Africans (P less than 0.05). The racial differences observed between Africans and Caucasians in fiber type proportion and enzyme activities of the phosphagenic and glycolytic metabolic pathways may well result from inherited variation.

Resting ventilation (VE) and progressive ventilatory responses to isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia were measured in six normal men. Compared with a control saline infusion given single blind on the same day, adenosine stimulated VE [mean increase: 1.3 +/- 0.8 (SD) l/min; P less than 0.02], lowered resting end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) (mean fall: -3.9 +/- 0.9 Torr), and increased heart rate (mean increase: 16.1 +/- 8.1 beats/min) without changing systemic blood pressure. Adenosine increased the hypoxic ventilatory response (control: -0.68 +/- 0.4 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1, where %SaO2 is percent of arterial O2 saturation; adenosine: -2.40 +/- 1.2 l X min-1 X %SaO2-1; P less than 0.01) measured at a mean PETCO2 of 38.3 +/- 0.6 Torr but did not alter the hypercapnic response.

Since the inotropic effect of digitalis appears to be related to cell membrane transport of calcium, we studied the effect of digoxin on diaphragmatic contractility in 20 anesthetized dogs. The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min. In 10 other dogs (group B) 0.2 mg/kg was administered. All measurements were performed during control and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after digoxin administration. In group A, digoxin plasmatic level at 60 min reached a therapeutic range in all dogs (1.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml), whereas in group B, digoxin plasmatic level was higher (8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml). No significant change in cardiac output and Qdi was noted after administration of digoxin, either in the dogs of group A or those of group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "input": "Abstract: Postoperative dysfunction of the diaphragm has been reported after upper abdominal surgery. This study was designed to determine whether an impairment in diaphragmatic contractility was involved in the genesis of the diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after upper abdominal surgery. Five patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery were studied. The following measurements were performed before and 4 h after surgery: vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Diaphragmatic function was also assessed using the ratio of changes in gastric pressure (delta Pga) over changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi). Finally contractility of the diaphragm was determined by measuring the change in delta Pdi generated during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves (Pdi stim). Diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in all the patients after upper abdominal surgery as assessed by a marked decrease in delta Pga/delta Pdi from 0.480 +/- 0.040 to -0.097 +/- 0.152 (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery compared with preoperative values. VC also markedly decreased after upper abdominal surgery from 3,900 +/- 630 to 2,060 +/- 520 ml (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after upper abdominal surgery compared with the preoperative values. We conclude that contractility of the diaphragm is not altered after upper abdominal surgery, and diaphragmatic dysfunction is secondary to other mechanisms such as possible reflexes arising from the periphery (chest wall and/or peritoneum), which could inhibit the phrenic nerve output.",

Glucose (Glc), E2, and hGH levels were determined from serial blood samples taken from an intravenous catheter. Glc did not change significantly during exercise, but different trends for the runners (increases) vs. controls (decreases) resulted in higher (P less than 0.01) postexercise levels in the runners. Resting hGH was higher (P less than 0.05) in the FRs and FCs than the MRs and MCs, respectively, and continued to be higher in the FCs (vs. MCs) during the first 30 min of exercise. The MRs achieved higher peak hGH levels and exhibited higher values than the MCs throughout exercise and recovery. There were no statistically significant training differences in the females. The strongest predictors for peak hGH were absolute work load and group (runners vs. controls), both of which combined accounted for 32-36% of the variability (P less than 0.01) in hGH response. Significant sex-related variables (sex, resting E2) accounted for 11-19% of the variability in peak or percent change in hGH, with E2 having a positive effect at rest but a negative effect during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "input": "Abstract: When dog lung lobes were perfused at constant arterial inflow rate, occlusion of the venous outflow (VO) produced a rapid jump in venous pressure (Pv) followed by a slower rise in both arterial pressure (Pa) and Pv. During the slow rise Pa(t) and Pv(t) tended to converge and become concave upward as the volume of blood in the lungs increased. We compared the dynamic vascular volume vs. pressure curves obtained after VO with the static volume vs. pressure curves obtained by dye dilution. The slope of the static curve (the static compliance, Cst) was always larger than the slope of the dynamic curve (the dynamic compliance, Cdyn). In addition, the Cdyn decreased with increasing blood flow rate. When venous occlusion (VO) was followed after a short time interval by arterial occlusion (AO) such that the lobe was isovolumic, both Pa and Pv fell with time to a level that was below either pressure at the instant of AO. In an attempt to explain these observations a compartmental model was constructed in which the hemodynamic resistance and vascular compliance were volume dependent and the vessel walls were viscoelastic. These features of the model could account for the convergence and upward concavity of the Pa and Pv curves after VO and the pressure relaxation in the isovolumic state after AO, respectively. According to the model analysis, the difference between Cst and Cdyn and the flow dependence of Cdyn are due to wall viscosity and volume dependence of compliance, respectively. Model analysis also suggested ways of evaluating changes in the viscoelasticity of the lobar vascular bed. Hypoxic vasoconstriction that increased total vascular resistance also decreased Cst and Cdyn and appeared to increase the vessel wall viscosity.",

During passive inflation, both parts of the diaphragm shortened and abdominal cross-sectional area increased. During passive deflation, both parts of the diaphragm lengthened and abdominal cross-sectional area decreased. We subsequently used the relationship between costal and crural diaphragmatic length, respectively, and abdominal cross-sectional area during passive inflation-deflation to predict the length changes in the costal and crural diaphragm during quiet breathing before and after bilateral phrenicotomy. In the intact animal the inspiratory shortening in the crural diaphragm was almost invariably greater than predicted from the relationship during passive inflation. During inspiration after phrenicotomy the crural diaphragm invariably lengthened, whereas the costal diaphragm often shortened. In general there was a good correlation between the measured and predicted length change for the crural diaphragm (r = 0.72 before and 0.79 after phrenicotomy) and a poor one for the costal diaphragm (r = 0.05 before and 0.19 after phrenicotomy).",

            "input": "Abstract: To study the relationship between lung weight and lymph flow, we used an in situ, isolated sheep lung preparation that allowed these two variables to be measured simultaneously. All lungs were perfused for 4.5 h at a constant rate of 100 ml X min-1 X kg-1. In control lungs, the left atrial pressure (Pla) was kept at atmospheric pressure. In experimental lungs, Pla was kept atmospheric except for a 50-min elevation to 18 mmHg midway through the perfusion. During this period of left atrial hypertension, pulmonary arterial pressure rose from 18 to 31 mmHg, lymph flow rose from 3 to 12 ml/h, and the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio (pi L/pi P) fell from 0.7 to 0.48. After left atrial pressure was returned to control, pulmonary arterial pressure, lymph flow, and pi L/pi P all returned to control levels. The rate of weight gain after the return of left atrial pressure to control was also the same as that in the control group. However, during the period of left atrial hypertension 135 ml of fluid were filtered into the lung, and this large increase in lung weight remained after the pressure was lowered. The presence of this substantial excess lung water despite control values for vascular pressures, lymph flow, rate of weight gain, and pi L/pi P suggests that the absolute amount of lung water has little influence on the dynamic aspects of lung fluid balance. These results are consistent with a two-compartment model of the interstitial space, where only one of the compartments is readily drained by the lymphatics.",

Gas transport efficiency was estimated by measuring the rate of CO2 removed from the lungs (Vco2) achieved during 45-s bursts of HFV applied before (control 1), during, and after (control 2) electrical stimulation of the transected vagi. During vagal stimulation the heart rate was maintained by electrical pacing. During the 15-s phase of vagal stimulation pulmonary impedance increased from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 2.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s, and Vco2 increased. When the electrical stimulation of the vagi was stopped, impedance and Vco2 returned to prestimulation values. Vco2 was always higher during electrical stimulation of the vagi when HFV of a fixed volume was applied over a range of frequencies or when a fixed oscillation frequency was used over a range of tidal volumes. The effects of vagal stimulation on HFV-mediated gas transport were quite similar to the effects of moving the locations of the bias flow inlet and outlet into the lung such that tracheal volume was decreased by 20 ml, an amount equivalent to estimated change in control airway volume thought to occur during vagal stimulation. We simulated the effects of vagal stimulation and decreased tracheal volume on Vco2 by using a previously described model of HFV-mediated gas transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Heart rate response in normal subjects reveals considerable variability, reflected by a relatively broadband interbeat interval power spectrum. A reduction in this autonomically modulated variability would be predicted to cause a narrowing of the spectrum. We retrospectively analyzed data from 10 aerobically conditioned men (age range 35-49 yr) who had undergone orthostatic tolerance testing with lower body negative pressure pre-bed rest and after 7-10 days of bed rest, while on placebo and after intravenous atropine. Spectra were derived by Fourier analysis of 128 interbeat interval data sets. Spectral power was estimated by computing the root-mean-square (rms) values (mean +/- SD) for the band encompassing the 2nd to 64th harmonics from subjects with a sufficient number of beats: placebo rms is 93 +/- 33 ms for pre-bed rest and 84 +/- 38 ms for bed rest (NS, n = 6); atropine rms is 63 +/- 24 ms for pre-bed rest and 40 +/- 23 ms for bed rest (P less than 0.01; n = 7). These data suggest that atropine \"unmasks\" a deconditioning effect of bed rest in athletic men, evidenced by a reduction in interbeat interval spectral power not apparent with placebo. Spectral analysis offers a useful means of quantitating the effects of bed-rest deconditioning and autonomic perturbations on cardiac dynamics.",

Isolated lungs were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solutions containing no inhibitor, PD 100,000 (mol wt 100,000), PD 5,000 (mol wt 5,000), or low-molecular-weight inhibitors (Prontosil or acetazolamide). The time course of effluent perfusate pH equilibration was measured in a stop-flow pH electrode apparatus. Pulmonary CO2 excretion (Vco2) was monitored by continuously recording expired CO2 concentration. The lungs were ventilated with room air and perfused at 37 degrees C with KRB prebubbled with 5% CO2- 20% O2- 75% N2. The results obtained show that both the low-molecular-weight inhibitors and PD's caused postcapillary pH disequilibria (delta pH) in effluent perfusate. However, only acetazolamide and Prontosil caused a reduction in Vco2. These results suggest that there is an intravascular CA, presumably associated with endothelial cell membranes, that is accessible to all inhibitors used and is responsible in part for equilibration of the CO2- HCO3- -H+ reactions in the perfusate but, under the conditions used, does not affect CO2 excretion; and there is an extravascular (possibly intracellular) CA that can be inhibited by low-molecular-weight inhibitors, is primarily responsible for enhanced CO2 transfer across the alveolar-capillary barrier (perhaps via facilitation of CO2 diffusion), and is in part responsible for pH equilibration.",

It has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of TE is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR) activity during expiratory loading. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while PSR's were simultaneously recorded. Both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume (VE) and increased expiratory duration (TE). The TE for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent VE. Thus two different VE-TE relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads. When TE was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory, a single linear relationship was observed. PSR activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as VE decreased and TE increased. A single linear relationship resulted when the number of PSR spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated TE for all types of loads. These findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of TE with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in PSR discharge. These results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of TE is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of PSR activity during the expiratory phase.",

Two postures required full support of body weight by the arms: arms up, hanging from a bar, and arms down with hands gripping parallel bars. Three involved muscles that flex and extend the trunk: a partial sit-up position while supine and nearly maximal spinal extension and flexion while standing. Changes at the inspiratory and expiratory volume extremes were recognized by having the subjects do two VC efforts: the first standing and the second in the posture in question while continuing to breathe on the spirometer. Control observations in which the second of a VC pair was performed in an unstressed posture allowed correction for the influence of rebreathing. The changes in corrected VC were small, the greatest being an average reduction of approximately 8% in the partial sit-up position. During full support of body weight by the arms, the VC was slightly increased due to a significant increase in the inspiratory extreme and no change in the expiratory extreme. Spinal extension produced small increases in lung volume at both extremes with no significant change in VC, whereas spinal flexion did not influence the upper extreme but did increase lung volume at the lower extreme. The changes are discussed in terms of trunk muscle action.",

Fourteen healthy men were exposed to three different experimental conditions: arm immersion, body immersion, and control. The men always sat upright while both upper extremities hung vertically at their sides. During arm immersion, one forearm was completely immersed for 30 min in either cold water (28 degrees C, n = 7) or warm water (38 degrees C, n = 7). This cold-warm water protocol was repeated on separate days for exposure to the remaining conditions of body immersion (immersion of 1 forearm and all tissues below the xiphoid process) and control (no immersion). Blood samples were simultaneously drawn from cannulated veins in both antecubital fossae. Hematocrit difference (Hct diff) was measured by subtracting the nonimmersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct dry) from the immersed forearm's hematocrit (Hct wet). Hct diff was approximately zero when the men were exposed to the control condition and body immersion in warm water. In the remaining conditions, Hct wet dropped below Hct dry (P less than 0.01, 3-way analysis of variance). The decrements of Hct diff showed there were differences between venous hematocrits in immersed and nonimmersed regions of the body, indicating that changes of the whole-body hematocrit cannot be calculated from a large-vessel hematocrit soon after immersing the lower body in cold water.",

Diaphragmatic force output, as assessed by Pdi, followed the periodic changes in EMGdi but during the occlusive phase the increase in Pdi was more than the increase in EMGdi. This increase in Pdi was essentially due to an increase in Ppl, since Pga and EMGdi had a linear relationship (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001) that did not change during the occlusive and ventilatory phases. Abdominal muscle recruitment evident in Pga and abdominal motion tracings during the occlusive phase when paradoxical rib cage motion was observed suggested that this increase in diaphragmatic efficiency was likely due to a change in diaphragmatic length-tension characteristics. These results demonstrate that, in patients with occlusive apneas, the diaphragm is the predominant respiratory muscle during NREM sleep and that its function is supported by abdominal muscle recruitment.",

            "input": "Abstract: Previous resistive load detection (RLD) studies have ignored the nose, the usual route of breathing. Weber's law predicts the delta R50 (the added load detectable on 50% of presentations) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance (R0) and thus the delta R50/R0 ratio (the Weber fraction) is constant. We have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load, we wondered if the nose might play a role in RLD. To determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in R0 in the range of normal nasal resistance (RN), we determined R0 and delta R50 using standard techniques under the following conditions: nose vs. decongested nose, nose vs. nose with added external R0 (3.0 and 8.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s), nose vs. anesthetized nose, nose vs. mouth, and mouth vs. mouth with added load (3 cmH2O X l-1 X s). We found that decongestant decreased RN [4.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) to 3.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05] and delta R50 (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05). When an external load of 3 cmH2O X l-1 X s was added to the nose, delta R50 did not change significantly (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s), but the Weber fraction decreased (0.28 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 between 35 and 40 Torr. In one group, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences. In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery. Whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control, 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia (9% O2 in N2), and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery, respectively. The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected. This suggested that the excess O2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an O2 deficit.",

We also assessed whether LTC4 and LTD4 increased the permeability to albumin in cultured monolayers of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In Ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs, LTC4 resulted in increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and the pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap) measured as the equilibration pressure after simultaneous pulmonary arterial and venous occlusions. Pulmonary venous resistance (Rv) increased to a greater extent than arterial resistance (Ra) in both Ringer-perfused and blood-perused lungs challenged with LTC4. The greater increase in PVR in blood-perfused lungs corresponded with a greater elevation of lung effluent thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentration. The LTC4-stimulated increase in PVR was prevented by pretreatment with meclofenamate (10(-4) M). LTD4 also induced rapid increases in Ppa and Pcap in both Ringer-perfused and blood-perfused lungs; however, Ppa decreased before stabilizing at a pressure higher than base line. The increases in Rv with LTD4 were greater than Ra. The LTD4-stimulated increases in Ra and Rv also paralleled the elevation in TxB2 concentration. As with LTC4, the increases in Ppa, Pcap, PVR, and TxB2 concentration were greater in blood-perfused than in Ringer-perfused lungs. Pretreatment with meclofenamate reduced the magnitude of the initial increase in Ppa, but did not prevent the response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We hypothesized that tachycardia mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation acted to defend VO2max at high altitude. Propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude (4,300 m) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol (80 mg three times daily) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo (lactose). Compared with sea-level values, the VO2max fell on day 2 at high altitude, but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups (26 +/- 6 vs. 32 +/- 5%, P = NS) and VO2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued. During 30 min of submaximal (80% of VO2max) exercise, propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects. The maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of O2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation, arterial O2 saturation, or hemoglobin concentration. Rather, it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the O2 uptake with each heartbeat. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal O2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.",

Three autologous infusions of 1 unit (U) whole blood (450 ml/U) were administered sequentially 2-7 days apart. Maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) increased from 5.04 l/min at control (C) to 5.24 l/min after 2 U (R2) and 5.38 l/min after 3 U (R3). Cardiac output during treadmill running at 91% control VO2max was 28.2 l/min at C, 29.8 l/min at R2, and 33.1 l/min at R3. Corresponding heart rates were unchanged, and stroke volume was increased at R3. Peak lactate concentration was reduced, and arterial acid-base status improved at R2 and R3 after standardized bouts of intense exercise. Arterial blood pressures and electrocardiograms during exercise were not affected by erythrocythemia. We conclude that the reinfusion of up to 3 U of autologous blood into highly trained endurance runners who have normal hematology does not adversely affect their cardiovascular response to maximal exercise. In addition, the increases in VO2max following reinfusion of 2 U, and again after 3 U, suggest that the aerobic power of the working muscles was not surpassed at these levels of erythrocythemia.",

Upon exposure of the homogenate to 37 degrees C in the pH meter, phosphocreatine and ATP were rapidly degraded to 35 and 60% of control concentrations after 30 s. Attempts at chemically arresting this hydrolysis were unsuccessful. Therefore we examined the significance of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm measurement in human biopsies taken at rest and following intense electrical stimulation. To accomplish this, pHm was measured at 0 degree C, where extensive hydrolysis did not occur. On the same homogenate, pHm was measured at 0 degree C with phosphagens and at 0 and 37 degrees C after phosphagen hydrolysis. The effect of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm at 0 degrees C was used to estimate this effect at 37 degrees C. In resting samples, phosphagen hydrolysis produced a nonsignificant acidification of 0.008 pH units and, in electrically stimulated samples, a nonsignificant alkalinization of 0.033 units. Measurements of homogenate PCO2 suggested that most of the CO2 remained in the sample during pHm measurement at 37 degrees C. The present work substantiates the use of the homogenate technique as an accurate and practical method for the estimation of intracellular pH in resting and exercise human muscle samples.",

Little is known about airflow characteristics of the complex nasopharyngeal airway of humans and experimental animals. Airflow characteristics in the nasopharyngeal airways of an adult male baboon (13.9 kg body wt) were investigated with thermistor probes and the findings compared with flow visualization, using a cinephotographic technique. A clear, acrylic, hollow cast of a baboon nose was made, and thermistor probes were inserted to record air velocity in the cast lumen using a wind tunnel to propel air through the cast. An identical cast was studied by passing water through the cast, with pulses of dye to reveal flow, and cinephotography was used for determination of flow velocities and flow patterns. Flow rates adjusted on the basis of a Reynolds conversion showed good correlations between the two methods, whereas cinephotography revealed areas of turbulence and vortex-like flow not detected by thermistor probes. These results suggest that water flow may provide useful information in complex airways where airflow cannot be determined by other methods.",

In the system model, arterial load is described by a modified windkessel load.

The ejection patterns of the model closely resemble the observed ejection patterns. Also, the model predictions for changes in the values of the system parameters are qualitatively correct.

            "input": "Abstract: The results of forty core-decompression procedures that were performed for ischemic necrosis of the femoral head in thirty-one patients over a four-year period were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the effectiveness of the procedure. The data did not support the published rates of success of the procedure for Stage-1 and Stage-2 lesions. With a mean length of follow-up of eighteen months, 60 per cent of the hips that had a decompression prior to collapse of the femoral head demonstrated progression of the lesion and were judged to be a failure by clinical or radiographic criteria. Computerized tomographic scans and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be 100 per cent sensitive for diagnosis in preoperative testing; isotopic bone-scanning was less sensitive (80 per cent). Functional intraoperative testing by the method of Ficat did not provide added sensitivity or specificity to the results of the preoperative bone scan. A postoperative or intraoperative fracture occurred in four hips, for an incidence that exceeded any in previously published reports. We concluded that core decompression should be considered a relatively ineffective procedure with significant morbidity.",

In a retrospective study that was done to assess our ability to determine whether displacement of the ligament (a Stener lesion) was present, we reviewed our accumulated experience with patients who had an injury of this ligament who were treated surgically between 1972 and 1984. Since our method of evaluation changed in 1977, we compared the preoperative and operative diagnoses in the twenty patients who were treated surgically from 1972 through 1976 with those in the twenty patients who were so treated from 1977 through 1984. Considering all forty patients who were treated operatively, sixteen (40 per cent) had a typical Stener lesion, and in two others (5 per cent) the ulnar collateral ligament was rolled up on itself and lying beneath the adductor aponeurosis. From 1972 through 1976, stability was tested with the metacarpophalangeal joint in complete extension or in varying amounts of flexion. Of the twenty thumbs that were evaluated by this technique and were treated surgically, 20 per cent had a Stener lesion. From 1977 through 1984, stability was tested with the joint in full flexion because of the findings in anatomical studies that were completed in 1977; the incidence of a Stener lesion in the twenty thumbs that were treated by repair or reattachment of the ligament during this time was 70 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Each of the eighteen compartment syndromes was documented by measurements of intracompartmental pressure that were obtained by the saline-injection technique, and all were treated by four-compartment fasciotomy. The incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted, grade-III open injury to a pedestrian. The physician must maintain a high index of suspicion to detect a compartment syndrome in the patient who has multiple trauma, as its clinical signs and symptoms may be masked by a closed injury of the head or the need for ventilatory support or prolonged anesthesia for other surgical procedures.",

The sensory changes include burning pain, numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation, while the motor changes range from weakness to complete paralysis. The episodes are transient and complete recovery usually occurs in ten to fifteen minutes, although in some patients gradual resolution occurs over a period of thirty-six to forty-eight hours. Except for burning paresthesia, pain in the neck is not present at the time of injury and there is complete return of motor function and full, pain-free motion of the cervical spine. In our series, routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine were negative for fractures or dislocations in all patients. However, the roentgenographic findings did include developmental spinal stenosis in seventeen patients, congenital fusion in five patients, cervical instability in four patients, and intervertebral disc disease in six patients. Spinal stenosis was determined by two different roentgenographic methods. The first was the standard method, and the second was a ratio method devised by us. Both measurements were made at the level of the third through the sixth vertebral body on a routine lateral roentgenogram of the cervical spine that was available for twenty-four of the thirty-two patients and for a control group of forty-nine male subjects of similar age who did not have any neurological complaints. Using the ratio method, a measurement of less than 0.80 indicated significant spinal stenosis in the group of twenty-four patients for whom roentgenograms were available, as compared with a ratio of approximately 1.00 or more in the control group. There was statistically significant spinal stenosis (p less than 0.0001) in all of the patients as compared with the control subjects by both methods of determining spinal stenosis. A survey of 503 schools participating in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football in the 1984 season found that 1.3 per 10,000 athletes had a history that was suggestive of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord. The phenomenon of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord occurs in individuals with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine, congenital fusion, cervical instability, or protrusion of an intervertebral disc in association with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal. We postulate that in athletes with diminution of the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal the spinal cord can, on forced hyperextension or hyperflexion, be compressed, causing transitory motor and sensory manifestations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In order to isolate the effects of diet on fracture-healing, we developed a method for producing a standard closed femoral fracture with minimum-soft-tissue injury. Three groups of animals were studied. Group I was a control group, in which the rats did not undergo an operation. The rats in Group II underwent intramedullary pinning of the right femur, but no fracture was created. The rats in Group III underwent pinning identical to that used for Group II, after which a closed, transverse femoral fracture was produced. Immediately after surgery, the animals in each group were subdivided into five diet-treatment subgroups. Subgroup A received a regular diet; Subgroup B received a protein-free diet; and Subgroup C received a mineral-free diet that was lacking in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D. Subgroup D received a protein-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirement of protein, and Subgroup E received a mineral-supplemented diet that was composed of three times the calculated requirements of calcium and phosphorus as well as a therapeutic dose of vitamin D, equivalent to that used in the treatment of osteomalacia. At the end of five weeks, the animals were killed and the right femur of each one was subjected to torsion-testing to failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A left total hip arthroplasty was performed in forty dogs. Thirty of the dogs had a titanium-alloy femoral prosthesis that had had one of three types of commercially pure titanium porous material applied along the length of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stem: ten with sintered fiber-metal, ten with sintered beads, and ten with plasma flame-spray coating. The remaining ten dogs had a femoral component that was circumferentially coated with commercially pure titanium that was plasma flame-sprayed along the length of the stem. In each group, five animals were killed at one month and five were killed at six months. Ingrowth of bone into all three types of porous coating was observed, indicating secure fixation of all components. By six months, there was more ingrowth of bone and new medullary bone adjacent to the proximal and distal aspects of the stems compared with the middle level of the stems in all groups. No significant difference in ingrowth of bone was observed in the beaded surface (25.2 per cent) and the fiber-metal surface (16.6 per cent) at one month, but at six months there was significantly less ingrowth into the beaded surface (23.3 per cent) than into the fiber-metal surface (37.3 per cent). In all groups, a proximal-to-distal gradient of loss of cortical bone was observed by six months. The group of dogs that had the stem with the circumferential coating experienced more severe loss of bone than did the three groups that had a stem with a partial coating. The magnitude of loss of bone was dependent on the extent rather than the type of porous coating.",

Fourteen of the fractures were treated with tension-band wiring and one, with an AO buttress plate. The patients were evaluated for pain, range of motion, strength, and function of the involved shoulder and the radiographic result at an average of fifty-four months after the injury. At follow-up, the shoulders had an average of 126 degrees of active elevation, 29 degrees of active external rotation, 81 degrees of active abduction, and internal rotation to the second lumbar vertebra. The only early complication was failure of fixation in the patient who had been treated with a buttress plate. In two patients, radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head later developed, and one of them required revision to a hemiarthroplasty. In conclusion, we recommend operative treatment for the healthy, active individual who has a three-part fracture of the proximal part of the humerus. We found that the best results with these difficult fractures are obtained using tension-band wiring.",

All of the patients had degenerative joint disease. Survivorship analysis was used to calculate a predicted cumulative rate of success for this series of total hip replacements over ten years of follow-up. This method of analysis of the data was chosen because it provides a prediction of the expected durability of a total hip arthroplasty in any individual patient. The need for revision because of loosening or infection or else radiographic evidence of migration of a component was the criterion for failure. Two revisions were performed for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. One infection necessitated revision, and radiographic evidence of loss of fixation was seen in one additional acetabular component and one femoral stem. Life-table calculations predicted that the survivorship of all of the total hip replacements in this series would be 87.6 per cent at ten years of follow-up. Based on the results of the application of this method of analysis to the current series, we concluded that a primary cemented total hip replacement, when performed for coxarthrosis, can be expected to function durably in an active middle-aged patient.",

Rotatory fixation without anterior displacement of the atlas (Type I) has been reported in only a few cases in which there has been a prolonged interval between injury and diagnosis. The majority of these cases eventually required cervical fusion for persistent deformity or instability. Two cases are presented in which this diagnosis was made early with the aid of rotated odontoid radiographs, tomography and computerised axial tomography. Treatment by a short period of halter traction achieved reduction and early return of function. The authors conclude that early recognition and treatment of this rare condition may prevent the subsequent deformity and instability for which cervical fusion has been required.",

We have tried to determine if differences in neurological response could be detected and measured clinically, and have compared the threshold of detection of vibratory sensation in 20 girls with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with that in 20 clinically normal age-matched controls. A highly significant reduction of the threshold of detection of vibration was seen in the scoliotic group compared to the controls (p less than 0.001). Curve magnitude did not correlate with this threshold for either the upper (r = 0.172) or lower extremity (r = 0.126). Significant asymmetry between right- and left-sided thresholds to vibration was demonstrated in the scoliotic group. Our study supports the concept that an aberration in the function of the posterior column pathway of the cord may be of primary importance in the aetiology of idiopathic scoliosis. A clinically practical test to measure this function is presented.",

We have conducted a prospective study of the serial changes in the MRI appearance of the intervertebral disc after chemonucleolysis with the enzyme chymopapain. Fourteen patients were studied after single-level chemonucleolysis and the results compared with a control group of 17 discs in six patients who had diagnostic discography without enzyme insertion. A consistent pattern of gradual loss of signal from the nucleus pulposus culminating in complete loss of nuclear signal was seen in all cases after chemonucleolysis. Chymopapain therefore produced MRI changes analogous with premature gross disc degeneration. The rate at which this occurred varied; complete loss of signal took at least six weeks. Transitory minor end-plate changes were present in five patients, probably representing a mild chemical discitis. No similar changes were seen in the discography group.",

Associated injuries were more severe in car occupants who were not wearing seat belts but the incidence of femoral fracture was not significantly different. The mean velocity change (delta-V) causing femoral fracture was 26 mph (42 km/h) and there was a higher incidence of femoral shaft fracture when delta-V was over 30 mph. Estimates of forces needed to cause fracture were higher than those found in cadaver studies.

In 10 patients (13 limbs) with this pattern of muscle activity, equinus deformity was treated by hemitransplantation of the tendo calcaneus. At follow-up, which was beyond the end of growth in seven limbs, there was no recurrence of deformity in nine. In three of the four failures, a technical fault may have caused loss of activity in the transplanted part of the tendon. The two-stage operation described is recommended in the management of this pattern of paralytic deformity.",

Eleven of the acetabular components migrated cranially and three femoral components migrated distally. This migration was most rapid during the first four months after operation. Our findings support the possibility that mechanical loosening is initiated by thermal injury during polymerisation of the cement; the less frequent migration of the metallic femoral component compared with the polyethylene acetabular component may be because the metal acts as a heat sink. Standard radiographs were inadequate for assessment of early mechanical loosening, whereas RSA could reveal migration within four months of the arthroplasty.",

By the end of 1983, 4505 arthroplasties for osteoarthritis and 3495 for rheumatoid arthritis had been recorded and reviewed one, three and six years after the operation. Using actuarial methods, the probability of the prosthesis remaining in situ after six years was calculated. In osteoarthritis this probability ranged from 65% for hinged prostheses to 90% for medial compartment prostheses. Two-and three-compartment prostheses produced intermediate results with 87% survival. In rheumatoid arthritis the probability varied from 72% for medial compartment prostheses to 90% for two- and three-compartment prostheses. The main reason for failure was loosening of the components, the second most common was infection. The probability of revision for infection by six years was 2% in osteoarthritis and 3% in rheumatoid arthritis. Most revisions were to a three-compartment prosthesis. Knee fusion at primary revision was required in 2% of the cases at six years.",

The advantages of this transfer over other microvascular osteocutaneous flaps are the available length of straight cortical bone, the large thin skin flap, the good diameter of the vascular pedicle and the fact that dissection is carried out under a tourniquet.",

In addition, the medial parapatellar wound was found to be subjected to significantly less tension during flexion; after arthroplasty it can be expected to heal faster and to be less liable to disruption during early mobilisation.",

We prepared a basement membrane matrix from autogenous striated muscle, used it to repair the sciatic nerve in rats, then investigated the results by histology and electrophysiology. When treated grafts were coaxially aligned with the nerve fascicles functional recovery appeared within 30 days, with good growth of axons into the distal nerve. Grafts with myotubes at right angles to the nerve fascicles supported nerve regeneration but at a slower rate. Grafts of coaxially aligned but untreated muscle allowed axon penetration only through naturally degenerated muscle fibres, with minimal axon penetration of the distal nerve. It is concluded that in the rat a treated graft with correctly orientated empty myotubes can facilitate and guide the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury and so lead to recolonisation of the distal stump with functional recovery.",

We have observed seven patients with this deformity for an average of six years from initial examination at 20 days to 3.5 years. Arthrography showed that the configuration of the ankle was apparently normal in patients under 10 months of age and that a ball-and-socket joint develops by four to five years of age, possibly in compensation for the loss of inversion and eversion caused by tarsal coalition. Ball-and-socket joint is therefore probably not congenital, but is an acquired deformity secondary to various pre-existing congenital conditions.",

Three of the patients were men and twelve were women. They ranged in age from 9 to 75 years. Their symptoms were chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitation and syncope. Definite diagnosis was confirmed by echo- and cineangiocardiography. There were 14 benign tumors consisting of 13 myxomas, one leiomyoma and one malignant myxosarcoma. The left atrium was the most common chamber involved (12 instances), followed by the right atrium (3). Surgery was performed in all cases under cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and cold crystalloid cardioplegia. Tumors were removed en bloc at the base with their attachment to the atrial septum or free wall in all cases. Three patients underwent concomitant mitral annuloplasty or mitral commissurotomy. Two cases with left atrial myxoma died postoperatively: one case associated with mitral annuloplasty died of congestive heart failure due to newly developed chordal rupture two months after surgery, and the other died of congestive heart failure 13 months after the first operation. Re-excision for recurrence of the myxosarcoma in the left atrium was performed in the latter case as a second surgical procedure. The remaining 13 cases with benign tumors are doing well and are without recurrence. From these favorable results, surgical intervention should be recommended prior to the occurrence of heart failure and severe complications such as coronary or peripheral embolism whenever cardiac tumors are detected by non-invasive echocardiography and cineangiocardiography.",

            "input": "Abstract: Ninety consecutive patients underwent surgery for coronary artery disease. Eighty-one (90%) did not require blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period; nine patients received 16 units of blood, 6 of whom bled excessively; 2 were re-explored. Twelve had post-operative haemoglobins below 8.5 G/dl during their stay. They were transfused a total of 28 units of blood before discharge. Post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 +/- 176 ml (SEM). Loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001). Patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 +/- 36 ml (P NS). Sixty-nine patients were not transfused. Haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 +/- 1.3 G/dl (SD). This declined to 10.2 +/- 1.2 G/dl on the fifth day. Discharge haemoglobin was 10.5 +/- 1.2 G/dl. Two patients died, one of myocardial infarction on the third day and the other of pancreatitis on the fourth. Both had had early blood transfusion. Haemoglobins were above 10 G/dl. Of the 69 untransfused patients 17% had supraventricular arrhythmias. Ten percent had serous wound discharges; 3 were infected. There were no sternal dehiscences. It is concluded that bank blood transfusion with its attendant hazards and expense is easily avoidable in most patients. This saving of resources will increase the availability of blood and rare groups for surgery.",

A high index of suspicion, the early recognition of the presence of vascular injury by thorough clinical evaluation, routine use of the Doppler flowmeter and broad indication of preoperative angiography resulted in prompt repair of these lesions in the majority of cases. Early exploration, wide fasciotomies, use of temporary intraluminal shunts during the bone fixation procedures (usually by internal plates), definitive venous and arterial repair after limb stabilization was achieved and frequent use of intraoperative angiography were the predominant factors in the treatment and outcome in these complex injuries. All eight limbs with closed fractures and/or dislocations were preserved, as well as 17 of 19 (89%) of the limbs with open or exposed skeletal injuries, resulting in a limb salvage rate of 92.6%.",

Twenty-seven aneurysms were thrombosed and presented with an acutely ischaemic limb or the sudden onset of severe claudication. Thirty-four patent aneurysms presented with either ischaemic ulceration or claudication due to tibial artery disease or were asymptomatic with normal distal pulses. Thrombosis made reconstruction difficult and at times required a femoro-tibial graft. In others reconstruction was not possible leading to amputation either as primary treatment or following failed revascularization. In patent aneurysms one or more tibial arteries were frequently occluded. It is postulated that obliterative atheromatous disease of the tibial vessels and the slow flow through the aneurysmal vessels is responsible for the high incidence of thrombosis, poor graft patency and a high amputation rate.",

Autogenous saphenous vein was absent or inadequate in all patients. Limb salvage was the primary indication for surgery (89.7%). Five and 8 years cumulative patency rates were 42.8% and 35.1% respectively for all H.U.V. by-passes and 52.4% and 41.9% respectively for femoropopliteal by-passes. Four out of the 5 femorotibial by-passes failed during the first month following surgery. Two of the 6 axillofemoral and 3 of the 4 composite aortopopliteal by-passes thrombosed within 1 and 3 years after surgery, respectively. Perioperative mortality was 5.1%, while overall mortality was 17.2%. The following conclusions can be drawn from these results: H.U.V. grafts did not achieve cumulative patency rates superior to those reported with autogenous saphenous vein, in limb salvage situations, when the saphenous vein is not available, the H.U.V. graft offers acceptable salvage rates, results from the 8-year follow-up period demonstrate the durability and long-term patency of H.U.V. grafts.",

To identify age-related alterations in vitamin D and PTH physiology and to assess their impact on skeletal health, we studied 62 normal men, aged 30-92 yr. The men were in excellent health, and none had any evidence of metabolic bone disease and/or known risk factors for osteopenia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations declined steadily with advancing age (r = -0.47; P less than 0.001), and there was a corresponding decline in serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] levels (r = -0.41; P less than 0.001). Serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations, however, did not vary over this age range (r = -0.07; P = NS). Plasma PTH levels increased with aging (r = -0.24; P less than 0.001), and there was a concomitant increase in urinary cAMP excretion (r = 0.38; P less than 0.001). Renal function (creatinine clearance) clearly declined with increasing age (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001). In conjunction with these changes in calcium metabolism, radial and vertebral bone mineral content declined. Whereas the fall in radial bone mineral content (single photon absorptiometry) at both proximal and distal sites was slight, there was a marked decrease in vertebral bone mineral content, as measured by quantitative computed tomography (r = -0.72; P less than 0.0001). The fall in vertebral bone mineral content correlated well with the declines in serum 25OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D concentrations (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001 and r = 0.51; P less than 0.001, respectively) and with the decline in renal function (r = 0.46; P less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of aging on bone mineral content could be accounted for in large part by concomitant changes in mineral metabolism. Both the decline in renal function and the fall in serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels were closely associated with the fall in bone mineral content. These results indicate that a decline in renal function and alterations in vitamin D metabolism occur with aging in normal men. These changes contribute to, if not cause, the associated decline in skeletal mineral content in aging men.",

No difference was found between women with type 1 diabetes and those with gestational diabetes. There was a negative correlation between maternal levels of SMBP during the last trimester and the birth weight percentile of the infants (r = -0.51). There was a 2- to 3-fold elevation of maternal insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) levels during pregnancy in both diabetic and nondiabetic women. A positive correlation (r = 0.49) was found between maternal IGF-I levels and the birth weight percentiles of their infants. The correlation between the ratio of IGF-I to SMBP, which may reflect the IGF-I available to the placenta, to birth weight percentile was higher (r = 0.57), and the SE of estimate of weight percentile was 23%. The ratio between IGF-I and SMBP in cord blood was correlated with birth weight, although cord blood IGF-I and SMBP values were not. The IGF-II levels in cord serum were 50% higher in the infants of diabetic than in those of nondiabetic mothers. These findings raise the questions of whether maternal SMBP levels influence the amount of IGF-I available for the fetal-placental unit and whether IGF-II participates in glucose homeostasis in the fetus.",

Basal plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ratios were significantly elevated in two of the three affected infants, and increased markedly in all three infants after administration of hCG. Since urinary etiocholanolone to androsterone ratios could not be determined accurately in this age group, the diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was confirmed by the finding of elevated urinary tetrahydrocortisol (THF) to 5 alpha-tetrahydrocortisol (5 alpha-THF) ratios, as determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in the affected male infants compared to those in age-matched normal infants. The THF/5 alpha-THF ratios, however, were lower in both the normal children and the affected infants, suggesting increased 5 alpha-reductase activity in infancy. The affected infants had THF/5 alpha-THF ratios comparable to ratios in adult carrier males and significantly lower than ratios in adult homozygotes. Two of the three affected infants are related to the large Dominican kindred we studied previously and initially were raised as females but, after parental counseling, were changed to a male sex of rearing.",

Five antibodies that varied by either their affinity for beta hCG or their specificity for epitopes on CTP were investigated. To measure hormone levels, we used as the radiolabeled indicator an alpha-subunit-reactive Mab. The monoclonal-immunoradiometric assay had a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.05 ng/ml. Serum levels of hCG or hCG-like material with CTP structure were measured in 229 healthy blood donors; 1.1% of healthy men and 4.6% of nonpregnant women younger than 50 yr had serum values varying between 0.05 and 0.23 ng/ml. Moreover, 6 to 7 healthy women older than 50 yr had detectable levels in the 0.05-0.20 ng/ml range. To study the disappearance rates in normal women, we followed serum hCG serum levels of 6 women who had previously received a single im injection of the hormone. These individuals failed to develop a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization; hCG declined from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/ml within 2 weeks. These results were in contrast to the findings in 12 patients with hCG-producing tumors. In 9 patients without any evidence of recurrent disease, hCG levels became undetectable within 5 months. However, 3 others had levels consistently above 0.05 but below 0.5 ng/ml. In 2 of these three patients, subsequent increasing hCG levels were associated with tumor recurrence. We conclude that this hCG assay based on both anti-peptide and anti-hCG Mabs may be useful in tumor monitoring.",

If pituitary glands were obtained within 3 h after sudden death of previously normal individuals, the viability of isolated pituitary cells prepared by dispersion with dispase was more than 75%. After 4 days of culture, dopamine (500 nM) inhibited PRL release by cells prepared from four normal pituitaries by 24 +/- 3% (+/- SEM). Pretreatment of the cells with 100 nM estradiol did not alter dopamine-mediated inhibition of PRL release. Estradiol alone increased basal PRL release and cell PRL content. Cultured PRL-secreting pituitary tumor cells, obtained by transsphenoidal operation from four patients, were similarly sensitive to dopamine. Estradiol stimulated tumor cell PRL release and content, but significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of dopamine. The estrogen receptor blocker tamoxifen did not alter PRL release, but it did reverse the estradiol-induced insensitivity of the prolactinoma cells to the dopamine agonist bromocriptine. In conclusion, these in vitro results indicate that estrogens do not antagonize the effect of dopamine on normal human PRL-secreting pituitary cells. In human pituitary tumor cells, however, estradiol decreased the sensitivity of PRL release to dopamine (agonists), and the estrogen action can be acutely reversed by tamoxifen.",

Seven patients with Cushing's disease and one with an adrenal adenoma received 600-800 mg/day ketoconazole for 3-13 months. Plasma ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels and urinary cortisol, 17-ketosteroid, and tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion were determined periodically during the treatment period. Plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH stimulation were determined before and during treatment. Rapid and subsequently persistent clinical improvement occurred in each patient; plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and cortisol excretion decreased soon after the initiation of treatment, subsequently remaining normal or nearly so throughout the treatment period. Urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion increased significantly. Plasma cortisol levels decreased. Plasma ACTH levels did not change, and individual plasma ACTH and cortisol increments in response to CRH were comparable before and during treatment. The cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia improved in one patient and was restored to normal in another. The seven patients tested recovered normal adrenal suppressibility in response to a low dose of dexamethasone during ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole is effective for long term control of hypercortisolism of either pituitary or adrenal origin. Its effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, and it, in some unknown way, prevents the expected rise in ACTH secretion in patients with Cushing's disease.",

No C-terminal galanin-like immunoreactivity was detected in plasma or tissue, suggesting differences in the amino acid sequence of human compared with porcine galanin. A non-C-terminally directed antibody was, therefore, used to characterize human galanin immunoreactivity by gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and to localize it by immunocytochemistry. The galanin content of whole adrenal gland was 2.6 +/- 0.9 (+/- SEM) pmol/g (n = 5). In contrast, however, pheochromocytomas had much greater concentrations (21 +/- 2.3 pmol/g; n = 16). Gel chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed 2 molecular forms of galanin immunoreactivity with identical elution positions in both normal adrenals and tumors. The concentration of galanin in plasma from both normal subjects and pheochromocytoma patients was below the detection limit of the assay (less than 10 pmol/liter). Using immunocytochemistry, galanin was localized to scattered cells or clusters of tumor cells in 5 of 11 pheochromocytomas and only a few chromaffin cells and cortical nerve fibers in normal adrenals.",

            "input": "Abstract: The concentration of FFA in normal human plasma in vivo generally ranges between 0.2 and 0.7 meq/liter; slightly higher concentrations have occasionally been reported in patients who are seriously ill. To determine whether such FFA concentrations may increase the concentration of free T4 in serum, we added increasing amounts of oleic acid to pooled normal human serum (with known FFA content) and measured free T4 by equilibrium dialysis. Total FFA up to 3 meq/liter in normal serum, representing an FFA to albumin molar ratio of about 5:1, had little or no effect on the free T4 concentration, while higher FFA concentrations progressively increased free T4. This same molar ratio of FFA to albumin had to be exceeded to cause a significant increase in the free T4 concentration in diluted serum and in serum from patients with nonthyroid illness. Serum from which more than 95% of the albumin had been removed by chromatography with Affi-Gel blue was much more sensitive to the effects of FFA on free T4. This enhanced sensitivity was reversed by readdition of albumin to the serum, and the addition of albumin to normal serum resulted in diminished effects of FFA on free T4. These results indicate the following: physiological concentrations of FFA do not significantly increase the free T4 concentration in normal human serum; when FFA reach supraphysiological concentrations in serum (in vitro) and the higher affinity FFA-binding sites on albumin become saturated (apparently at an FFA to albumin molar ratio of approximately 5:1), the excess FFA interact with other serum proteins, including thyroid hormone-binding globulin, and thereby increase the free T4 concentration; the concentration of albumin (or other FFA binders) must be considered when evaluating the observed effects of FFA. To explore the relevance of these findings to the hypothesis that FFA may inhibit the binding of T4 to plasma proteins in patients with nonthyroid illness, we measured plasma FFA concentrations in 11 severely ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. We found a mean plasma FFA concentration of 0.45 +/- 0.11 (+/- SEM) mEq/liter and a mean serum albumin concentration of 2.39 +/- 0.29 g/dl in these patients. Their mean plasma FFA to albumin molar ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.41. Since the FFA to albumin molar ratio must exceed about approximately 5:1 before a significant increase in the serum free T4 concentration occurs, these results suggest that FFA do not commonly influence the circulating free T4 concentration in vivo, even in severely ill patients.",

A reasonable assessment of bioavailable T can be made by using 50% ammonium sulfate to precipitate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound T. The supernatant non-SHBG-bound T (non-SHBG-T) correlates well with physiological androgen activity. To assess bioavailable T in normal aging men, we analyzed serum samples from seven healthy aged men (65-83 yr old) and compared the results to samples from 13 young men (22-39 yr old). Mean serum T, FT, and LH concentrations were not significantly different in the 2 groups. However, the mean absolute non-SHBG-T level was significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in the older group. In a separate population of 20 impotent but otherwise healthy men (5 27-37 yr old, 10 48-64 yr old, and 5 66-69 yr old), the mean absolute non-SHBG-T concentration was lower in middle-aged (P less than .01) and elderly men (P less than 0.001) than in young men. The absolute FT was lower only in the elderly group (P less than 0.05), while mean LH and T levels were similar in all 3 age groups. These data suggest that serum concentrations of tissue available T are decreased in aged men and that non-SHBG-T measurement is a more sensitive indicator of this decrease than are serum T or serum FT measurements. These changes appear to begin by middle age.",

Incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the conversion of [3H]25OHD3 to a more polar vitamin D3 metabolite (up to 15 pmol/10(6) cells). Untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite. Several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin D3, namely 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. (1) The metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. (2) The metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor as authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3. (3) The biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo (stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3. The LPS-stimulated synthesis of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng LPS/10(6) cells. Polymyxin B abolished the effects of LPS on 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages. Our data suggest that LPS-stimulated macrophages can modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite.",

Pretreatment (day 3) serum T4 and T3 concentrations were 49 micrograms/dl and 590 ng/dl, respectively. With 24 h after the first dose of ipodate, serum T3 fell by 40%, and it subsequently ranged from 209-278 ng/dl throughout the 39-day ipodate treatment period. Serum T4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69% and 41% of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment, respectively; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19-22 micrograms/dl. These plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period. Rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated. Serum rT3 concentrations increased from 468-672 ng/dl to greater than 1400 ng/dl 24 h after each ipodate dose. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera, and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were present in the infant at 10 days of age, and the titers decreased progressively thereafter; the half-life for the antimicrosomal antibody titer was 3 weeks. The data suggest that sodium ipodate can be useful for treatment of neonatal hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.",

Both groups of patients were receiving T4 when studied. [3H]Thymidine incorporation induced by 0.1 mU/ml bovine TSH was significantly inhibited by the addition of 2 mg/ml IgG from patients with primary myxedema (P less than 0.01), while it was not affected by IgG from the normal subjects or 23 of the 24 patients with goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis. IgG from patients with primary myxedema also inhibited the [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by Graves' IgG, but not that induced by forskolin, cholera toxin, (Bu)2cAMP or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. The inhibition of TSH-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by IgGs from patients with primary myxedema was significantly correlated with their inhibitory activities against both TSH-induced cAMP generation and TSH binding (P less than 0.001).

The principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The presence of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids, especially dehydroepiandrosterone. The secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol. In the absence of hLDL, ACTH increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion. After ACTH treatment, increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97K protein in human fetal adrenal cells. Interestingly, the content of this enzyme in cells treated with ACTH in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue. This finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma LDL is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland.",

Seven normal women received CC or placebo in alternate cycles in a randomized double blind fashion. On the day after drug administration, blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h for serum LH determinations. Daily blood samples were also obtained throughout the luteal phase for determination of serum LH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone. LH pulse frequency increased from 2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM)/8 h after placebo to 3.9 +/- 0.6/8 h (P less than 0.01) after CC treatment, but pulse amplitude did not change. The transverse mean of serum LH was higher after CC (13.6 +/- 0.5 mIU/ml) than after placebo (8.4 +/- 0.3 mIU/ml; P less than 0.001), and luteal phase length was increased from 13.5 +/- 0.5 to 16.0 +/- 0.4 days (P less than 0.001) by administration of CC. Luteal phase levels of E2 and progesterone measured daily were significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in CC-treated cycles. These findings suggest that CC increases the frequency of hypothalamic GnRH secretory episodes, perhaps by an action involving a decrease in endogenous opioid peptide activity. Since peripheral progesterone levels were elevated in the CC-treated cycles, E2 may play a permissive role in the ability of progesterone to increase endogenous opioid peptide activity acutely. Furthermore, since the luteal phase was significantly prolonged by an increase in endogenous LH pulse frequency, the slow frequency of LH pulses in the normal late luteal phase may contribute to the onset of luteolysis in the human.",

The women whose infants had the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy. Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy.",

Sleep was denied for 64 h from 0700 h on awakening from accommodation sleep until polygraphic sleep was resumed at 7100 h of the third day (D3) such that 2 consecutive nights of usual 2300-0700 h sleep were missed. This protocol allowed examination of any modulatory effects on the daily patterns in TSH concentrations during sleep deprivation on D1-2 (1100-3500, 3500-5900 h) or during resumption of usual nightly sleep on D3 (5900-8300) compared to that of a previously studied group of normal young men. The circadian nature of the daily TSH waveform was evidenced by its daily repetition within a subject both basally and during D1-2 sleep deprivation and by its synchronization within the basal, deprived, or resumed sleep days. The peaks in each subject's daily TSH patterns on D1-2 were consistently longer, and the daily maxima and cosine acrophases on D1-2 were consistently later than those on D3 when basal sleep was resumed. About half the daily TSH concentration maxima and daily cosinor amplitudes on D1-2 were greater than those of the respective sleep-resumed TSH patterns of D3. Both the group mean TSH patterns and the cosinor 95% confidence ellipses also indicated the daily peak in the TSH waveform to be significantly longer, later, and larger during D1-2 sleep deprivation than during the basal or D3 periods. These results indicate that significant alteration of the daily TSH waveform can occur in response to absence of sleep and are compatible with the existence of an inhibitory effect in early nightly sleep on TSH release. The TSH patterns during the 1700-2300 h intervals of rising TSH levels were congruent in the basal, deprived, and resumed sleep periods. Prompt reversion to the basal TSH pattern also occurred when sleep was resumed on D3. Both of these observations suggest the alteration in TSH waveform during sleep deprivation to have arisen from an inhibitory effect in sleep rather than from a change in period or phase of a generating oscillator.",

Measurements were made during 5-h glucose clamp studies, carried out at plasma insulin concentrations of about 10 microU/ml (0-150 min) and about 60 microU/ml (150-300 min). Differences between the patient groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance. The ability of insulin to either suppress plasma FFA concentrations or stimulate glucose uptake was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) in patients with NIDDM, and this was true of both the obese and nonobese groups. The defect in the ability of insulin to suppress plasma FFA concentrations in patients with NIDDM was more apparent at the lower insulin concentration, whereas resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in NIDDM was more dramatic at the high insulin concentration. Finally, a significant correlation (r = -0.67; P less than 0.001) between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and plasma FFA concentration was found in the entire group. These data emphasize the fact that patients with NIDDM are resistant to multiple actions of insulin, and that the magnitudes of the defect in insulin suppression of plasma FFA levels and stimulation of tissue glucose uptake are roughly comparable.",

During the long clinical remissions, she had no recognizable laboratory abnormality. She had two episodes in the year following incomplete transphenoidal pituitary tumor resection, but has had none in 2 yr since receiving radiotherapy. The episodes were caused by mineralocorticoid actions of large ACTH-induced increases in cortisol and deoxycorticosterone secretion. A history of episodic edema and hypokalemia, often attributed in women to surreptitious diuretic abuse, requires a careful search for hypercorticism even in the absence of clinical Cushing's syndrome.",

            "input": "Abstract: Insulin may mediate the hyperandrogenism that frequently occurs in patients with insulin-resistant states. To test this hypothesis, we studied five normal women and one woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Each woman received a 0.1 U/kg insulin bolus dose, followed by a 10 mU/kg X min insulin infusion for 12-16 h. In the normal women, an average insulin level of 1832 +/- 292 (+/- SEM) microU/ml was achieved; serum glucose was clamped at 116 +/- 5 mg/dl. At this level, insulin may bind to the insulin-like growth factor I receptor as well as to its own receptor. Contrary to our working hypothesis, a rise in serum testosterone did not occur in any women during insulin infusion, and in one women, serum testosterone levels decreased. When analyzed as a percentage of the basal value, serum progesterone levels fell 20% in the normal women within the first 2 h of insulin infusion, but did not change thereafter. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, however, uniformly and progressively decreased by 39% after 12 h of insulin infusion in the normal women and by 31% at 14 h in the woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. The fall in serum DHEA-S levels was not due to diurnal rhythmicity, as the changes in serum DHEA-S levels did not correlated with those in serum cortisol. Suppression of PRL release also was excluded as a cause of the fall in DHEA-S levels. These results indicate that acute hyperinsulinemia of 12- to 16-h duration does not increase serum testosterone or DHEA-S concentrations and, indeed, can cause a decline in serum DHEA-S levels in both normal women and the single woman studied with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans.",

We investigated renal sensitivity to ultralow dose vasopressin infusions in two patients with a syndrome of hypodipsia, hypernatremia with selective osmoreceptor dysfunction, early puberty, and aggressive behavior. The patients were water loaded until a hypotonic diuresis was established. Vasopressin was infused in stepwise increments from 0.4-12 fmol/kg X min. Both patients had increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin, achieving negative free water clearance at infusion rates of 0.4 and 4 fmol/kg X min (normal greater than or equal to 6). Treatment for 3 months with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) led to an improvement in behavior and the reporting, for the first time, of a sensation of thirst. After DDAVP therapy both patients had a reduction of their renal sensitivity to infused vasopressin. We conclude that untreated patients with essential hypernatremia have increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin which is reduced by DDAVP administration.",

Plasma OT levels were measured by RIA before, during, and after private self-stimulation to orgasm in normal men (n = 9) and women (n = 13). Blood samples were collected continuously through indwelling venous catheters. The subjects pressed a signal to indicate the start and finish of orgasm/ejaculation. Objective assessment of sexual arousal and orgasm was obtained by measuring blood-pulse amplitude and electromyographic activity, recorded continuously throughout testing from an anal device containing a photoplethysmograph and electromyograph electrodes connected to a polygraph located in an adjacent room. These measures allowed collection of data from men and women of changes in blood flow and muscle activity in the lower pelvic/pubic area. Plasma OT levels increased during sexual arousal in both women and men and were significantly higher during orgasm/ejaculation than during prior baseline testing. We suggest that the temporal pattern of secretion could be related to smooth muscle contractions of the reproductive system during orgasm.",

            "input": "Abstract: In the course of characterizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing cell surface antigens on dispersed human parathyroid cells (dPTCs), we identified one MAb (4F2) that bound avidly to parathyroid cells and had marked effects on parathyroid function. The binding of MAb 4F2 to human adenomatous dPTCs resulted in a marked [53.8 +/- 7.9% (+/- SEM)] reduction in low calcium (Ca)-stimulated PTH secretion to levels equivalent to those in cell suppressed by high extracellular Ca (1.5 mM). Typically, these functional effects were optimal at antibody dilutions of 1:10(4) to 1:10(5). Cell viability was confirmed at the conclusion of each experiment by trypan blue exclusion (greater than 90-95%) and cell surface immunofluorescence. Parallel studies using the Ca-sensitive dye Quin-2 showed that inhibition of PTH secretion in 4F2-treated cells was associated with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca (Cai) of 188% in 0.5 mM Ca; these values also approached Cai levels in control cells incubated in high Ca. Mab controls, P3 X 63, which do not bind to dPTCs, and Mab LC7-2, which recognizes a different epitope of the same antigen as 4F2 on dPTCs, did not alter PTH secretion or Cai. Immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled parathyroid cell extracts with MAb 4F2 demonstrated proteins with mol wt of approximately 145, 85, and 45 under nonreducing conditions and 85 and 45 kilodaltons after reduction with 5% mercaptoethanol. These studies suggest that 1) Mab-4F2 binding to its cell surface antigen inhibits PTH secretion by human adenomatous parathyroid cells in vitro; 2) the alterations in secretory function could be related to by an attendant increase in Cai; 3) the 4F2 antigen on dPTCs is a heterodimeric protein of (approximately) 85K and 45K; and 4) the 4F2 antigen may be an important component of the Ca-sensing and/or signal-transducing mechanism in this cell.",

The 24-h secretory profile of GH was generated by 20-min sampling in 10 young women (aged 18-33 yr), 10 young men (aged 18-33 yr), 8 postmenopausal women (aged greater than 55 yr), and 8 older men (aged greater than 55 yr). A computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total GH secretion, as reflected in the 24-h integrated GH concentration (IGHC), and pulsatile secretion, as denoted by pulse frequency, duration, amplitude, and the fraction of GH secreted in pulses during the 24-h period (FGHP). IGHC was significantly greater in women than in men (P less than 0.025) and greater in the young than in the old (P less than 0.003). The mean pulse amplitude, duration, and FGHP were each greater in the young (P less than 0.006, P less than 0.03, and P less than 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly different between the sexes. The mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age. The serum concentration of free estradiol, but not free testosterone, correlated with IGHC (r = 0.46; P less than 0.005), pulse amplitude (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001), and FGHP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0002). After correcting for the effects of estradiol, neither sex nor age influenced IGHC or mean pulse amplitude, while the effect of age on FGHP was reduced from 81% to 29%. Of the indices of GH secretion, FGHP had the strongest correlation (r = 0.43; P less than 0.006) with somatomedin-C. Somatomedin-C declined significantly with age in both sexes. Our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on GH secretion. These effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels. These observations suggest an amplifying action of estradiol on the neuroendocrine regulation of pulsatile GH release.",

The depolarization was associated with decreased input resistance. Ca ionophore A23187 caused similar mesangial cell contraction and depolarization. The reversal potential (Vr) of the depolarization response to AII and AVP was -29 +/- 3 and -25 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- SD), respectively. Not only the Vr of the AII-induced depolarization but also Vr of the Ca ionophore-induced response was dependent upon the extracellular Cl- concentration. Further, AII and AVP caused cell contraction and membrane depolarization in Ca++-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA. These data suggest the presence of Ca++ -activated Cl- channels in the mesangial cells and that AII and AVP increase Cl- permeability via an elevation of [Ca++]i released from the intracellular organellae.",

One population is normal; the second population appears to have a deletion of about 10 amino acid residues from the middle of the triple helical domain. The mutation in pro alpha 2(I) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1(I) chains, lowers the melting temperature of type I collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2(I) chain, and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture. On the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families, it appears that the OI type IV phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2(I) that alter the triple helical structure of type I collagen.",

Hypertensives had higher resistance (2,295 vs. 1713 dyn-s/cm5), characteristic impedance (145.7 vs. 93.9 dyn-s/cm5), total external power (1,579 vs. 1174 mW), peripheral reflections (ratio of backward to forward wave components of 0.54 vs. 0.44), and first zero crossing of impedance phase angle (4.15 vs. 2.97 Hz). These abnormalities were eliminated with vasodilatation. Differences between groups were not further exacerbated when pressure was increased during handgrip exercise. Beta blockade further increased resistance and reflections. Thus, hemodynamic abnormalities of essential hypertension (increased resistance, reflections, and pulse wave velocity, and decreased compliance) are compatible with an increased vasomotor tone that is further unmasked during generalized beta blockade.",

Isotopic sodium uptake was stimulated by bicarbonate when compared with gluconate (2.5 nmol/mg protein per 5 s versus 1.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s), and this process was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes. Imposition of an interior-positive potassium diffusion potential further stimulated isotopic sodium uptake to 3.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s, an effect that occurred only in the presence of bicarbonate and was blocked by disulfonic stilbenes. Kinetic analysis of the rate of bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed saturable stimulation with a Vmax of 2.7 nmol/mg protein per 2 s and a Km of 10.4 mM. The effect of bicarbonate concentration on bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake was more complex. The present results demonstrate an electrogenic (negatively charged) sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in basolateral membrane vesicles from the rabbit renal cortex.

Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, in the case of sickle cells, when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated \"passive\" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation.",

The former would result in progenitors at midswitch with skewed fractional beta-globin synthesis programs, the latter in a Gaussian distribution. For these studies, we obtained bone marrow from rhesus monkey fetuses at 141-153 d (midswitch). Mononuclear cells were cultured in methyl cellulose with erythropoietin, and single BFU-E-derived colonies were removed and incubated with [3H]leucine. Globin synthesis was examined by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The beta-globin synthesis pattern of single fetal colonies was skewed, and did not fit a normal distribution. The fetal pattern resembled the pattern of an artificial mixture of fetal and adult progenitors, suggesting that the fetal progenitor pool could contain populations with different beta-globin programs. This non-Gaussian distribution in the progenitors of midswitch fetuses is consistent with a discontinuous model for hemoglobin switching during ontogeny.",

Only higher primate species showed cross-reactivity, and IGF-I, IGF-II, and other peptides were without effect. Circulating BP levels in healthy subjects rose threefold from early childhood to puberty. In 65 adults aged 18 to 65, the mean level (+/- SD) was 6.12 +/- 1.43 micrograms/ml, and declined with age. Strong growth hormone-dependence of BP was also seen; there was a 2.2-fold increase in active acromegaly and a 50-80% reduction in growth hormone deficiency. Poorly controlled diabetic subjects had BP levels 40% below normal, whereas in renal failure and third-term pregnancy a mild elevation was seen. Measurement of BP may provide a useful adjunct to IGF assays in growth disorders.",

The major peak of LPL activity after gel filtration of PHP eluted after the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and just before the peak of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. When PHP contained chylomicrons, an additional peak of LPL activity eluted in the void volume of the column. Most HTGL activity eluted after the LDL and preceded the elution of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. LPL activity in preheparin plasma eluted in the same position, relative to lipoproteins, as did LPL in PHP. Gel filtration of purified human milk LPL mixed with plasma or isolated LDL produced a peak of activity eluting before LDL. During gel filtration of PHP in high salt buffer (1 M NaCl) or after isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in high salt density solutions, most of the lipase activity was not associated with lipoproteins. LPL activity was removed from PHP by elution through immunoaffinity columns containing antibodies to apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo E. Since lipoproteins in PHP have undergone prior in vivo lipolysis, LPL activity in PHP may be bound to remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins.",

Infusion with 7 or 65 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3 X 24 h-1 led to normal or slight hypercalcemia associated with physiological and supraphysiological plasma concentrations of the hormone while calcium supplementation normalized plasma calcium despite 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations as low as those observed in hypocalcemic controls. Constant administrations of [14C]D3 during the supplementation regimens uncovered a stimulation of the in vivo 25(OH)D3 production by calcium supplementation; this was further confirmed in vitro by an increase in the hepatic microsomal D3-25 hydroxylase. The group supplemented with pharmacological doses of the hormone displayed lower circulating concentrations of both D3 and 25(OH)D3 while the in vitro 25(OH)D3 production remained unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Investigation of the kinetics of intravenous 25(OH)[3H]D3 revealed similar elimination constants in all groups. The data indicate that calcium supplementation of hypocalcemic D-depleted rats results in an increased transformation of D3 into 25(OH)D3 while supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not affect the in vitro D3-25 hydroxylase but seems to influence the in vivo handling of the vitamin by accelerating its metabolism.",

Measurement of energy expenditure over periods of 24 h or longer is needed to determine more accurately rates of daily energy expenditure in humans. We provide a detailed description of a human respiratory chamber and methods used to determine rates of energy expenditure over 24-h periods in 177 subjects. The results show that: fat-free mass (FFM) as estimated by densitometry is the best available determinant of 24-h energy expenditures (24EE) and explains 81% of the variance observed between individuals (24EE [kcal/d] = 597 + 26.5 FFM); 24EE in an individual is very reproducible (coefficient of variation = 2.4%); and even when adjusted for differences in FFM, there is still considerable interperson variability of the daily energy expenditure. A large portion of the variability of 24EE among individuals, independent of differences in body size, was due to variability in the degree of spontaneous physical activity, i.e., \"fidgeting,\" which accounted for 100-800 kcal/d in these subjects.",

Injury was measured as pneumocyte lysis and detachment, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Extracts of cotton dust and field-dried bract produced significant dose- and time-dependent lysis and detachment of both target cells, while green bract extract was less damaging. Extracts treated with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone to remove tannins produced significantly less injury. In contrast, purified 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-flavan 3,4-diol (THF), a tannin in cotton dust and bract, caused substantial cell damage. Field-dried bract extract and THF also produced dose-dependent inhibition of pneumocyte protein synthesis. Endotoxin levels did not correlate with observed injury. THF added to rat tracheal explants caused epithelial disruption and desquamation, whereas endotoxin did not. Instillation of cotton dust and field-dried bract extract in rat lungs produced disruption of bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle constriction, while polyvinylpolypyrrolidone-treated cotton dust extract produced no injury. These findings suggest that extracts of cotton plants are toxic to alveolar, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium and that THF or other tannins may be the responsible agents.",

Deoxycholate alone did not induce these reactions. The other bile acids such as cholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, and taurocholate were also active. Under the similar conditions, deoxycholate enhanced the secretagogue-induced diacylglycerol formation that was derived mainly from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate. Deoxycholate did not enhance the secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or Ca2+ mobilization. Deoxycholate did not affect amylase secretion, which was induced by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase C-activating 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Since diacylglycerol and Ca2+ may be responsible for the secretagogue-induced amylase secretion, our results indicate that small amounts of bile acids increase the sensitivity to the secretagogue of diacylglycerol formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, and thereby enhance amylase secretion from pancreatic acini.",

HCO3 secretion also showed saturation kinetics as a function of mean luminal [Cl] (Km, 4-11 mM). Both Cl self-exchange and Cl-HCO3 exchange thus appear to be carrier-mediated. Addition/removal of basolateral HCO3 qualitatively changed Cl and HCO3 transport as expected for Cl-HCO3 exchange, but quantitatively changed Cl absorption more than HCO3 secretion. The diffusive Cl permeability and the transepithelial conductance in the presence of HCO3/CO2 and cAMP were higher than in their absence suggesting that HCO3/CO2 and cAMP together increase a conductive Cl pathway parallel to a 1:1 Cl-HCO3 exchanger. Thus, cAMP not only stimulates the overall process of anion exchange (probably by increasing an electroneutral exchanger and/or a series Cl conductance), but also stimulates a Cl conductance parallel to the exchange process.",

When the morphological transitions are initiated by a temperature shift from 25 degrees to 37 degrees C, all three strains undergo similar physiological changes, but these are less severe in G184A and G222B than in the Downs strain. The transitions from mycelial to yeast morphology in both of the more virulent strains are also one-third more rapid than in Downs. We also find that the differences in temperature sensitivity of the three strains can be correlated with the temperature required for complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The differences in sensitivity to elevated temperatures extend to the growth of yeast cells of all three strains. Considered together, our results suggest that sensitivity to elevated temperatures may be a key factor accounting for differences in virulence and that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the primary event in the morphological transition in all three strains.",

Accordingly, we have surveyed membrane skeletal protein interactions during storage. We uncovered a decrease in the in vitro formation of spectrin-actin complex in the absence (50%) or presence (60%) of protein 4.1. Actual formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex fell in a linear fashion during the storage period. This fall in spectrin-actin interaction tightly correlated with the decline in total red cell phospholipid (R = 0.9932) measured simultaneously. This decrement of spectrin-actin association could be restored to greater than 70% of normal values by preincubation of stored spectrin with 50 mM dithiothreitol. This storage injury to spectrin-actin interaction might weaken the membrane skeleton and lead to decreased red cell survival. In vitro reversibility of the damage by reducing agents suggests a possible new direction for prolonging the shelf life of stored blood.",

Human eosinophils (25-95% purity) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia. PAF-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M; lyso-PAF had minimal activity over the same dose range. Compared with PAF-acether, the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), histamine, and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) tetrapeptides was negligible. Conversely, neutrophil responsiveness to PAF-acether (optimum 10(-6) M) was comparable in effect to LTB4 (optimum dose 10(-8) M). It was shown that PAF-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils. Comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to PAF-acether and the other chemoattractants, although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to PAF-acether and LTB4. Thus, PAF-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration.",

Polyadenylated hepatic apoB-100 mRNA from two abetalipoproteinemic patients was normal in size, and the concentration of apoB-100 mRNA was increased sixfold compared with control hepatic apoB-100 mRNA levels. ApoB-100 was detected in hepatocytes of abetalipoproteinemic patients by immunohistochemical techniques.

Radioiodinated thrombospondin bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors with a similar affinity and capacity. As monitored with a monoclonal antibody to thrombospondin, the divalent ion-dependent and -independent pathways for the expression of the endogenous pool of thrombospondin on the surface of thrombin-stimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors were also qualitatively and quantitatively similar. GPIIb-IIIa or ligands associated with GPIIb-IIIa thus are not essential for the binding of thrombospondin to platelets. Therefore, thrombospondin interacts with unique receptors on platelets.",

Similar changes have been reported in apparently normal mucosa bordering colorectal cancer. \"Normal\" left sided colorectal mucosa from 32 patients with rectal cancer was studied. Each case was matched by age and sex to a patient with diverticular disease and a patient with irritable bowel syndrome. Twenty five patients with right sided cancer were matched to patients with Crohn's disease. Sections were stained with mild periodic acid Schiff (mPAS) (selectively stains N-acetyl sialic acid lacking in O-acetyl group) and other closely related techniques. Reactions were graded negative, weak, and intense. An intense reaction was found in 9% of cases; there was no difference between the various matched groups. Phenylhydrazine interposition failed to block the mPAS effect, indicating that a positive result was due to a deficiency of sialic acid with O-acetyl substituents rather than neutral mucin. Different staining patterns in left and right colon were probably due to differing ratios of total sialic acid:fucose. These findings indicate a hitherto unsuspected colorectal goblet cell sialomucin heterogeneity within the general population, but no association with neoplastic disease is apparent.",

The results of this study confirm previous reports that NSE and S100 protein are useful markers for malignant melanoma. NSE staining intensity in the cases of malignant melanoma was significantly higher than that in benign naevi (p = 0.011). Intensity of staining for S100 protein was not significantly higher in the malignant melanomas. There was, however, a significant S100 gradient when comparing superficial and deep intradermal portions of these tumours (p = 0.003). This feature was not seen in benign naevi. The greatest intensity of S100 protein staining was found in the deeper portions of the malignant melanomas. This gradient difference was not seen with staining for NSE. Although it seems that the overall intensity of staining for NSE is more effective in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions, the difference in staining intensity between the superficial and deep portions of the tumour may be the better indicator of adverse behaviour in lesions in which the diagnosis of malignancy is uncertain.",

X resolves as two bands on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with molecular weights of 81 K and 89 K and its major antigenic epitope is associated with disulphide bonds.

Distal yellow-brown discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, nail plate thickening, and splinter hemorrhages indicate a diagnosis of type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris rather than psoriasis, while onycholysis (particularly marginal), salmon patches, small pits, and larger indentations of the nail plate indicate a diagnosis of psoriasis. Histology demonstrated that a nail biopsy would be a useful diagnostic procedure if nails were involved in isolation but provided no additional diagnostic features to those found from biopsy specimens of involved skin in the two conditions. The similarity in nail morphology between the type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris patients and five patients with chronic erythroderma resulting from Sezary syndrome indicated that these changes may represent a nonspecific reaction pattern that may result from prolonged erythema of the proximal nail bed and matrix. The rough nails (trachyonychia) described in advanced Sezary syndrome were not observed in any of our patients.",

Within an observation period of up to 8 years (mean, 63.1 months) six patients with squamous cell carcinomas and three with basal cell carcinomas were observed. Eight of the nine tumor patients had been exposed to potential carcinogens such as arsenic and/or ionizing radiation prior to PUVA treatment. Five with squamous cell carcinomas were skin type I or II; in four of the six patients with squamous cell carcinomas the tumors were located on unexposed skin areas. The mean cumulative ultraviolet A (UVA) dose in three of the six squamous cell carcinoma patients was three times as high as that in the group of nontumor patients. The other three squamous cell carcinoma patients had lower mean doses than nontumor patients, as did the three patients with basal cell carcinomas. Although the cumulative UVA dose may eventually turn out to be relevant for PUVA carcinogenesis, our present data do not sufficiently substantiate a correlation between cumulative UVA dose and squamous cell carcinoma formation in PUVA-treated patients. This report confirms that previous exposure to carcinogens appears to be the most important factor for nonmelanoma skin tumor formation in long-term PUVA patients.",

The two estrogen regimens and dextrothyroxine were discontinued early because of adverse effects. No evidence of efficacy was found for the clofibrate treatment. Niacin treatment showed modest benefit in decreasing definite nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction but did not decrease total mortality. With a mean follow-up of 15 years, nearly 9 years after termination of the trial, mortality from all causes in each of the drug groups, except for niacin, was similar to that in the placebo group. Mortality in the niacin group was 11% lower than in the placebo group (52.0 versus 58.2%; p = 0.0004). This late benefit of niacin, occurring after discontinuation of the drug, may be a result of a translation into a mortality benefit over subsequent years of the early favorable effect of niacin in decreasing nonfatal reinfarction or a result of the cholesterol-lowering effect of niacin, or both.",

Patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups depending on the status of the left anterior descending artery and the presence or absence of a left ventricular aneurysm: Group I (n = 25): aneurysm with occluded left anterior descending artery; Group II (n = 27): no aneurysm and occluded left anterior descending artery; Group III (n = 23): no aneurysm and patent left anterior descending artery; and Group IV (n = 4): aneurysm with patent left anterior descending artery. Single vessel disease was more common in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Groups II and III (no aneurysm) (chi 2(4) = 12.8; probability value equal to 0.012). Collateral blood supply in the presence of an occluded left anterior descending artery was significantly less in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Group II (no aneurysm) (0.9 versus 2.4, p less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery disease and collateral blood supply in Groups I and II were directly related (p = 0.012). Neither age, sex nor risk factors for coronary disease correlated with aneurysm formation. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent angina, new myocardial infarction, embolic events or sudden death. More patients in Group II underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in association with inherent poor collateral blood supply is a significant determinant of aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease with either good collateral circulation or a patent left anterior descending artery is uncommonly associated with the development of left ventricular aneurysm.",

The effects of aspirin (1 g systemically and 100 mg intracoronary) in preventing large coronary artery vasodilation induced by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate was investigated in 16 patients. Of these, 5 received 0.3 mg (Group 1A) and 11 received 3 mg (Group 1B) intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate, before and 15 minutes after aspirin. Relative to control, 0.3 mg isosorbide dinitrate induced a 19 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) and 19.5 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01) increase in coronary diameter before and after aspirin, respectively (p = NS). Changes after 3 mg isosorbide were 23 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01) and 26.5 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01), respectively, before and after aspirin (p = NS). In 10 additional patients (Group 2), the effect of the same dose of aspirin on rest coronary artery tone was assessed: changes relative to control were 0.9 +/- 5.5% (p = NS) minutes after aspirin. The intracoronary administration of 3 mg isosorbide dinitrate produced a 24.7 +/- 11% increase in coronary diameter (p = NS versus pre- and postaspirin isosorbide in Group 1B). Urinary 6-ketoprostaglandin-F1 alpha values in urine samples collected in the 8 hours before and the 8 hours after the study in five patients in Group 1B and five patients of Group 2, revealed a 36 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) reduction in excretion of prostacyclin (p less than 0.01).

            "input": "Abstract: This double-blind, randomized study evaluated the effect of nifedipine on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Two hundred forty-one patients with dilation of 271 coronary sites were randomized at the time of hospital discharge to receive nifedipine, 10 mg (123 patients), or placebo (118 patients) four times daily for 6 months. No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen. Coronary stenosis recurred in 33% of patients in the placebo group and in 29% of patients in the nifedipine group who complied with the regimen and had angiograms (p = NS). In conclusion, the study did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of nifedipine on the incidence of recurrent stenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.",

All patients were without documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) before the investigation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in two patients on day 5, but in nine on day 24 after infarction. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as was the change in the distribution ratio of induced sustained ventricular arrhythmia from day 5 to day 24 (p less than 0.05). The types of arrhythmia induced on day 24 were sustained ventricular tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 207 ms in six cases (five monomorphic, one polymorphic), and ventricular fibrillation in three cases. These nine patients did not differ from the remaining nine patients in maximal serum creatine kinase, infarct site, number of stenosed coronary arteries, global left ventricular ejection fraction (47 +/- 7% versus 46 +/- 10%) and results of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring, but they had a significantly shorter right ventricular effective refractory period (223 +/- 10 ms versus 259 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.05).

            "input": "Abstract: In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, competition between the right and left ventricles for the limited pericardial space results in distortion of left ventricular geometry reflected in displacement of the ventricular septum toward the left ventricular cavity. Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 +/- 36 versus 53 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring in the first half of diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 +/- 14% versus 70 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early diastolic cavity expansion (32 +/- 11%) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0.04 +/- 0.19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0.68 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Projected coronary arteriograms were digitized into 512 X 512 pixel mode and percent stenosis was calculated by comparing background-corrected videodensitometric values over stenotic and normal segments. Subjects underwent repeat coronary arteriography because of worsening symptoms of angina or heart failure; subjects with renal failure, coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac transplant were excluded. Clinical variables determined at the time of the first arteriogram included age, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and presence or absence of cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean interval between arteriograms was 29.3 months. Overall progression of coronary stenosis was observed in 40 of the 44 subjects; the mean progression at 24 months was 39% (90% confidence interval, 33 to 45%) and at 36 months was 48% (40 to 56%). The degree of overall progression was related to the length of time between arteriograms (F = 5.81, p less than 0.05) and to serum cholesterol level (F = 4.37, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that using an accurate, quantitative method, it is possible to measure progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis within 2 to 3 years of the initial arteriogram. Serum cholesterol appears to be an important determinant of disease progression.",

The diastolic deceleration slope as measured from the continuous wave tracing was significantly different among subgroups of patients with mild (1.6 +/- 0.5 m/s2), moderate (2.7 +/- 0.5 m/s2) and severe (4.7 +/- 1.5 m/s2) aortic insufficiency as determined from aortography. Deceleration slopes greater than 2 m/s2 separated individuals with moderate and severe insufficiency from those with mild insufficiency. Similar findings were seen when comparing the pressure half-time method of diastolic velocity decay with the more severe grades of aortic insufficiency exhibiting the shortest pressure half-times. There was also a high correlation (r = 0.85) between the deceleration slope measured by continuous wave Doppler recordings and the grade of insufficiency as assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. End-diastolic velocities correlated poorly (r = 0.28) with catheter-measured end-diastolic pressure difference between the aorta and the left ventricle. These findings demonstrate that the aortic regurgitant flow pattern by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography may be useful in quantitating the degree of aortic insufficiency by assessing the rate with which aortic and left ventricular pressures equilibrate during diastole.",

Therefore, Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy were compared in 25 patients. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed using an apical four chamber view with the sample volume at the level of the mitral anulus. Doppler measurements included peak velocity of the early diastolic filling wave, time to peak early diastolic velocity from both end-systole and end-diastole, diastolic time period and diastolic integrated velocity (early, atrial and total). The cross-sectional area of the mitral anulus and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume were estimated from measurements made on the apical four chamber view. Scintigraphic measurements included normalized peak filling rate, time to normalized filling rate from both end-diastole and end-systole, diastolic time period and relative diastolic filling during early and atrial filling. Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy compared favorably in assessment of fractional filling during early diastole (r = 0.84) and atrial systole (r = 0.85), ratio of early to atrial filling (r = 0.83), diastolic filling period (r = 0.94) and interval from end-diastole to peak early diastolic flow (r = 0.88). Normalized peak filling rate and time to normalized peak filling rate from end-systole did not correlate closely by these two techniques. The differences in normalized peak filling rate may be explained by difficulties in estimating mitral anulus cross-sectional area and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

During the 6 to 24 hour period, the control group (n = 20) developed ventricular triplets at rates exceeding 270/min. Seven dogs spontaneously developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (421 +/- 12 beats/min) at 13 +/- 2 hours. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was present for 38 +/- 8 seconds before ventricular fibrillation developed. One dog developed recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, with six episodes lasting from 8 to 72 seconds (375 to 425 beats/min). At 24 hours, ventricular pacing produced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (378 +/- 12 beats/min) in 9 of 13 surviving animals. Nadolol administration 6 hours after coronary artery ligation (n = 19) lowered both the rate (241 +/- 8 versus 328 +/- 8 beats/min; p = 0.001) and the incidence (8 +/- 6 versus 198 +/- 61 per hour; p = 0.004) of rapid ventricular triplets and prevented sudden arrhythmic death (0%; p = 0.005). Nadolol failed to prevent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (88%; 365 +/- 12 beats/min) produced by ventricular pacing. The data suggest that nadolol prevents spontaneous sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by selectively suppressing the arrhythmia trigger (rapid ventricular triplets) without altering the underlying arrhythmia substrate.",

In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes.

After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes.

It is not known whether human plaques take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo. In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing atheromatous plaques were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 degrees C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human atheromatous plaques should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis.",

Single, double and triple truncated exponential shocks separated by 1 ms were delivered through various electrode combinations and cardiac vectors after electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway not incorporating the interventricular septum (catheter electrodes or epicardial patches between anterior and posterior left ventricle) required the highest total energy (22.6 and greater than 26.4 J, respectively) and peak voltage (1,004 and greater than 1,094 V, respectively) to terminate ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway including the interventricular septum required lower total energy and peak voltage to defibrillate. Combinations of two sequential shocks between an intracardiac catheter electrode and anterior left ventricular epicardial patch, between the catheter electrode and subcutaneous extrathoracic plate and between three ventricular epicardial patches all significantly reduced total energy (7.7, 8.7 and 7.8 J, respectively) and peak voltage (424, 436 and 424 V, respectively) needed to defibrillate. Three sequential shocks exerted no significant additional reduction in total energy of the defibrillation threshold than did two sequential shocks. Infarcted canine heart required less peak voltage but not total energy to terminate ventricular fibrillation than did noninfarcted heart. Therefore, two sequential shocks over different pathways reduce both total energy and peak voltage required to terminate ventricular fibrillation.",

Sixty-three infants underwent coarctation repair by resection between 1960 and 1980, and 62 underwent subclavian angioplasty between 1977 and 1985. The mean age (+/- SEM) at operation for infants with subclavian flap angioplasty was 1.54 +/- 0.93 months and for infants with resection was 2.70 +/- 0.93 months (p = 0.02). There was no difference between the groups in patient weight at initial repair or the proportion of patients with complex anatomy or aortic arch hypoplasia. Follow-up duration for the subclavian flap group was 2.55 +/- 0.51 years (range 0.3 to 8.2), and for the resection group was 7.97 +/- 3.61 years (range 0.6 to 21). Indication for reoperation was the presence of a coarctation gradient at rest of 40 mm Hg or greater and arm hypertension. Reoperation was required in 5 patients in the subclavian flap group and 12 patients in the resection group. The mean reoperation rate after subclavian flap repair was 0.0356 reoperations per patient-year, and after resection was 0.0342 reoperations per patient-year (p = 0.94). To determine an individual's risk of requiring reoperation from these group measures, a reoperation risk model was developed. The risk of reoperation by the fifth postoperative year was found to be 16.3% after subclavian flap repair and 15.7% after resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Twenty-nine of these 38 had no associated intracardiac anomaly (Group I), and 9 had complex intracardiac anatomy associated with low pulmonary blood flow (Group II). In Group I the drainage was infracardiac in nine, supracardiac in seven, intracardiac in eight and mixed in five. In both groups, in those with venous obstruction the flow in the individual pulmonary veins and ascending or descending vein was nonphasic, varying only with respiration. Flow in the absence of obstruction was phasic, varying with the cardiac cycle. Distal to a site of obstruction the flow was nonlaminar and of high velocity irrespective of the amount of pulmonary blood flow. The pulsed Doppler technique provides important physiologic information in the patient with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection before surgical intervention.",

Results were compared with similar data from 30 normal children, 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In patients with partial AV canal, the portion of total cardiac length occupied by the atrial septum did not differ from normal (24.8 +/- 9.9% versus 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p greater than 0.05), but there was a deficiency of both AV and ventricular septal tissue, the latter occupying only 48.2 +/- 7.0% of total cardiac length (versus 57.9 +/- 4.1% in normal subjects, p less than 0.05). Similarly, patients with complete AV canal had a normal amount of atrial septal tissue, a deficiency of AV septal tissue and a deficiency of ventricular septal tissue which was even greater than that of patients with a partial defect (39.4 +/- 5.0% versus 48.2 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.05). Thus, although partial AV canal defect is often called ostium primum atrial septal defect, the amount of atrial tissue is usually normal, the defect being formed by a deficiency of AV and ventricular septal tissue. In the complete form of the lesion, the deficiency of ventricular septal tissue is greater.",

The diagnosis of specific disease processes has allowed for prenatal intervention by new techniques designed to improve fetal survival. The application of ventricular pacing in a hydropic fetus with complete atrioventricular (AV) block is reported. Complete AV block resulted from maternal collagen vascular disease. The application of ventricular pacing was to allow for further in utero development and for reversal of hydrops fetalis after improvement in cardiac output. Despite fetal death 4 hours after placement of the ventricular pacing lead, this procedure when applied earlier in the development of hydrops may allow for fetal survival. Ventricular pacing was accomplished without apparent trauma to mother or fetus and no evidence of fetal injury was seen at necropsy. Therefore, in the fetus who would otherwise die in utero before the point of viability ex utero, fetal ventricular pacing may be a rational alternative to current observation.",

With subsequent balloon angioplasty, the lesion was further decreased to 10% residual stenosis. The entire procedure was well tolerated without chest pain or burning, vessel perforation or spasm, thrombus formation or embolization of debris. The patient was free of pain at 1 month follow-up. This case demonstrates the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty.

In the interval between 3 and 10 to 12 months, mean myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased 53 and 26% in the left and the right ventricle, respectively. The total number of myocyte nuclei remained constant in either ventricle. In the following period, between 10 to 12 and 19 to 21 months, a 39% further cellular hypertrophy on the left side of the heart was found in association with an 18% loss of cells in the ventricle. Cell loss was accompanied by discrete areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the subendocardium. In contrast, no myocardial damage was observed in the right ventricle, and the measured 35% additional enlargement of myocytes occurred without a change in cell number. Thus, the aging left ventricle is composed of a smaller number of hypertrophied cells. Cellular hypertrophy may explain the unaltered cardiac function of the aged myocardium.",

To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function.",

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W). The reduction in PaO2 was not due to alveolar hypoventilation, because nifedipine did not alter arterial carbon dioxide tension, or to changes in mixed venous oxygen tension, which nifedipine increased at rest (39 +/- 2 versus 43 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and during submaximal exercise (31 +/- 4 versus 33 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.03) and maximal exercise (27 +/- 3 versus 31 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

To investigate the effect of two treatment regimens, subjects were paired according to their skin sensitivity to ragweed extract and the severity of their rhinoconjunctivitis the previous year. One of each pair was randomly allocated to receive injections at weekly intervals, and the other subject was to receive injections daily until a local or systemic adverse reaction occurred and then to switch to a weekly schedule for the rest of the course. Blood was obtained immediately before each injection and at the end of the study to examine the rates of change of ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibody levels and to evaluate whether these or other variables could be used to predict the occurrence of adverse reactions. Immediate reactions were minimal in both groups, but more late reactions occurred in subjects receiving the modified rush regimen; therefore, although the total number of injections received by the two groups was similar, the total dose of protein injected in the rush group was only half that achieved in the weekly group. Treatment induced increases in ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in both groups; the increase in IgE was similar in the two groups, but the increase in IgG was higher in the weekly group. There was a marked decrease in skin sensitivity to ragweed extract after treatment that was directly related to the IgG antibody response, and therefore, these changes were greater in the weekly group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In contrast, we found that 16 patients with CSD had significantly increased lymphocyte transformation responses to cat-scratch antigen when patients were compared to control subjects.

Lymphedema was first noticed in the patient at 3 years of age, and pleural effusions developed 7 years later. Thoracentesis demonstrated that the right pleural fluid was yellow, clear, and had the composition of lymph. The left pleural fluid was milky and had a higher triglyceride and lymphocyte content than the right pleural fluid. Complete removal of pleural fluid transiently increased total lung capacity to a maximum of 52% predicted. Strict dietary management with a low-fat and high-protein diet resulted in a transient partial reversal of circulating lymphopenia and low T cell concentration. This was accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte and T cell concentration in the pleural fluid. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from pleural fluid synthesized increased amounts of DNA, and added mitogens or antigens further increased DNA synthesis. Dietary therapy had a minimal effect on this DNA synthesis. Despite circulating hypogammaglobulinemia, normal antibody activity was detected. The proportion of B cells in pleural fluid was greater than that in the circulation, and dietary therapy did not alter this difference. Pulmonary physiology improved during the initial 9-month period of diet therapy, but then the rate of fluid accumulation increased, causing respiratory compromise. Stability was achieved by a right-sided pleurodesis, followed 18 months later by a left pleurodesis with the addition of a shunt to provide internal lymph drainage.",

Pentamidine administration produced fever, severe myositis, and clinical deterioration, and therefore, desensitization to TMS was attempted. This was done with low doses of oral suspension and then intravenous administration during a period of 60 hours. The patient reacted with fevers, arthralgia, and erythema that cleared 4 days after the desensitization was completed. This single case of successful desensitization to TMS in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggests that the oral route may be useful in similar situations when this drug is urgently needed.",

The inflammatory cell infiltrate in this reaction contained large numbers of basophils and eosinophils with accompanying neutrophils and monocytes. Ocular tissue can serve as a priming site for systemic immunization and also for elicitation of a secondary flare after challenge with antigen. Very few inflammatory cells were observed in the cutaneous epithelium of either primary or secondary flares. In contrast, the mucosal stroma and epithelium contained large numbers of inflammatory cells (basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils), suggesting directed cellular movement onto the ocular surface. The lesion of ocular basophil hypersensitivity in the guinea pig has features in common with two human eye diseases, vernal conjunctivitis and contact lens-associated giant papillary conjunctivitis. We hypothesize that the acute basophil hypersensitivity reactions of the conjunctiva are transformed into chronic inflammatory and proliferative states in vernal conjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis.",

            "input": "Abstract: Because mast cells (MCs) in skin of atopic dogs are heterogeneous with respect to tissue fixation and staining properties, we determined the effect of antigen on each type of MC in vivo. Skin biopsies were done in anesthetized, ragweed-sensitized dogs before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after intradermal injections of ragweed antigen (n = 5) or glycerin diluent (n = 4). In each case, one biopsy specimen was fixed with formalin, and a second specimen from an adjacent abdominal site was fixed with basic lead acetate. In sections stained with Alcian blue, 49.7% more MCs (p less than 0.05) were detected in tissue fixed with basic lead acetate (\"typical\" plus \"atypical\" MCs: 2916 +/- 581/mm3; mean +/- SEM) than in tissue fixed with formalin (\"typical\" MCs: 1955 +/- 537/mm3). After antigen, the number of \"typical\" MCs detectable in tissue sections progressively decreased during the 24-hour period, whereas the number of \"atypical\" MCs was lowest at 1 hour and had increased at 24 hours. After diluent, MC numbers did not change significantly over time. A late-phase response (LPR), detected clinically as induration and edema, was present 6 hours after antigen in four of five dogs, but LPR was not detected after diluent. The size of LPR was correlated (r = 0.85; p less than 0.05) with the decrease in the number of \"typical\" MCs at 6 hours. We conclude that the response of the \"typical\" and \"atypical\" MC to antigen in vivo differs markedly. The \"atypical\" MCs participate in the early, acute response to antigen, and the \"typical\" MCs may be associated with the development of the LPR.",

            "input": "Abstract: It is evident that asthma and the other allergic diseases constitute a health problem of international scope. There is a need for well-designed, large-scale, prospective epidemiologic studies designed to define precisely the magnitude of the worldwide problem created by allergic disorders. Most studies to date have been small and have involved special groups rather than the entire population. With the exception of data reported from developing countries, prevalence rates for childhood asthma are noted to be both increasing and higher than adult rates. While exact reasons are not known, the state of development of immune system regulation and hyperreactivity to allergens encountered in early life may play a role. Whether the actual prevalence and incidence of allergic diseases in children are increasing or whether this observation represents a phenomenon resulting from improved diagnostic methods and recognition of these disorders needs to be established. Paradoxically, despite advances in treatment, the severity of asthma and allergic diseases appears to be increasing. Accordingly, it is especially important to search for the factors that lead to the expression of immune and hypersensitivity mechanisms. Differences in rural and urban populations appear to be real and suggest the need to examine the factors of indoor and outdoor environments created by air pollution, crowding, and allergen exposure and the demands made on the immune system by frequency of challenge by respiratory tract infections. Still among the unknowns is the effect on the natural history of allergic disease after changes in urban-rural residences in countries in which helminth infections are not hyper IgE-stimulating factors. The creation of new occupationally related allergens at worksites and the contribution of industrialization to the deterioration of the natural environment needs to be adequately assessed. Whether breast feeding may have an effect on either the prevention or delayed emergence of food allergies in children requires documentation by long-term prospective studies based on objective testing. A possible relationship between respiratory tract infection and the development of asthma is exemplified by clinical observations. The emergence of asthma in infants increases with successive episodes of bronchiolitis; triggering of asthmatic attacks by acute respiratory tract viral infections is a common occurrence, especially during childhood years; and chronic adult onset asthma is often preceded or accompanied by chronic sinusitis or complicated by lower respiratory tract infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Dust exposure was estimated by personal and area sampling for total dust during a work shift and cumulative exposure by duration of employment. Seven percent of the workers had an elevated RAST, and 20% had nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Elevation in RAST was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Almost half (46%) of the workers with RAST elevation had bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to 18% in workers with no RAST elevation. The association was unaffected by total IgE level or by limiting the analysis to workers without respiratory symptoms and was most apparent in younger workers. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as with lower levels of pulmonary function. The likelihood of bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased with increasing age but was unrelated to the dust-exposure concentration. RAST elevation was unrelated to employment duration or dust exposure and was not associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms or lower levels of pulmonary function independent of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that plicatic acid-specific IgE and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness are associated in western red-cedar workers and that this association may reflect a causal connection.",

The occurrence of both phenomena in the same patient made it possible to study cross-reactivity patterns of potato antigens. An 11-year-old girl, exclusively breast-fed for her first 4 months, developed anaphylactic symptoms after ingestion of potato at 5 months of age when she was fed potato for the first time. Subsequently, she developed urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory and systemic symptoms on contact with potatoes, ingestion of potatoes, and exposure to cooking potatoes or potato pollen. Three allergenic extracts from potato pulp, peel, and pollen were prepared. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectrofocusing of the three extracts were performed. IgE-mediated allergy to these extracts was demonstrated by means of immediate skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer, RAST, RAST inhibition, and leukocyte histamine release. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pulp extract followed by electroblotting and autoradiography demonstrated specific IgE antibodies directed against several proteins ranging from 14,000 to 40,000 daltons.",

Rocket immunoelectrophoresis for C4d is a sensitive assay for C4 activation in plasma. We have evaluated the value of this assay in identifying patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. C4 activation was assessed in the plasmas of 15 patients with hereditary angioedema, five patients with variant form of hereditary angioedema, and four patients with acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. Control groups consisted of 27 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and/or angioedema and seven normal volunteers. C4 activation was detected in all 52 plasma samples collected from the 24 patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. The degree of C4 activation increased during attacks of angioedema and decreased (but remained elevated) during treatment with attenuated androgens. The concentrations of C4, C2, and C1 inhibitor were also measured; however, none of these measurements identified all of the patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. Thus, we conclude that the measurement of C4 activation is one of the best tests available to evaluate a patient for C1-inhibitor deficiency, and a normal result will exclude the diagnosis of C1-inhibitor deficiency.",

Nine subjects demonstrated a significant fall in peak flow in one or more challenges. In all cases the most severe reaction was observed after the wine with high SO2 content.

The absorption of injected epinephrine was variable and in several cases very slow. The individual maximum values for epinephrine in plasma were 4.65 +/- 1.09 (range 0.74 to 8.31) nmol/L, and these maxima were attained 5 to 120 minutes after injection. Inhaled epinephrine was rapidly and dose dependently absorbed. Ten inhalations resulted in 2.72 +/- 0.84 (0.75 to 5.67) nmol/L within 5 minutes and 20 inhalations resulted in 7.19 +/- 1.78 (2.10 to 13.83) nmol/L with rapid increases and maxima within 20 minutes in seven of eight subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting when epinephrine was administered by inhalation. Our results indicate that inhalation of 2 to 3 mg of epinephrine produces rapid increases of epinephrine concentrations in plasma to levels that have previously been demonstrated to counteract bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in subjects with asthma. Inhalation has several advantages over injection for self-administration of epinephrine, e.g., in patients who are allergic to insect (Hymenoptera) stings. Apart from the absorption being more rapid, the locally high concentrations of epinephrine in the airways should be advantageous, since bronchoconstriction is one of the life-threatening phenomena of the anaphylactic reaction. This route of administration is also simple for the patient.",

Significant increases in airway responsiveness to histamine (tenfold fall in PC20 FEV1) were documented 7 hours after exposure for 5 minutes to red cedar while baseline spirometry remained unchanged. A dual asthmatic reaction was induced during the following days by exposing the subject to red-cedar sawdust for 30 minutes and plicatic acid for 7 minutes. After recovery of PC20, the subject was reexposed to plicatic acid for 15 and 30 seconds on 2 consecutive days. No significant changes in FEV1, forced vital capacity, and residual volume were demonstrated in the following 8 hours, although minimal changes in forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC were observed. PC20 dropped significantly and required 2 weeks to recover. This example illustrates that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine can precede the changes in airway caliber after an antigen challenge. It also demonstrates that such changes can persist for up to 2 weeks after the challenge, even when no significant changes in FEV1 are induced.",

Fifteen percent of all subjects (or 84% of subjects classified LPE IgE antibody positive [Ab +]) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p I (Rye I), and 4% of all subjects (or 26% of subjects classified LPE IgE Ab +) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p II (Rye II). These data and similar results obtained in an allergy-enriched group of 361 subjects are consistent with previous studies that Lol I is a major allergen and Lol II is a minor allergen of LPE. Whether we studied LPE, Lol I, or Lol II, responder subjects were younger than nonresponder subjects and more male than female subjects were responders. We then investigated the quantitative interrelationships among ST, IgE, and IgG Ab responsiveness to LPE, Lol I, and Lol II in the allergy-enriched group. For each allergen, log-log correlations were strong and significant for ST versus IgE Ab and for IgE Ab versus IgG Ab. All subjects IgE Ab + to Lol I or Lol II were IgG Ab + to that allergen, supporting other evidence for a commonality in the genetic control influencing the production of IgE and IgG Abs to a given allergen. Log-log correlations among ST end points, IgE Ab levels, or IgG Ab levels were strong for LPE versus either Lol I or Lol II but weak between Lol I and Lol II, consistent with the reported lack of cross-reactivity between Lol I and Lol II. Despite these findings, almost all Lol II + subjects were Lol I + by ST (98%), IgE Ab (91%), and IgG Ab (83%), suggesting that the Ia-restricted immune recognition of both these molecules is at least in part under a common genetic control.",

This study quantitated the influence of weight gain on birth weight and identified rates and total amounts of weight gain related to the birth of healthy-sized infants to healthy low-income women who entered pregnancy underweight, at normal weight, overweight, or obese. Data used in the study were obtained from randomly sampled prenatal health records from Maternal and Infant Care (MIC) projects in Cleveland and Minneapolis. Subsamples of healthy mothers who delivered healthy-sized infants were identified from each sample, and rates and total amounts of weight gain by prepregnancy weight status group were calculated. There were 384 healthy mother and healthy-sized infant pairs in the Cleveland subsample and 75 such pairs in the Minneapolis sample. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of prenatal weight gain and birth weight varied depending on prepregnancy weight status. Prenatal weight gains related to the birth of healthy-sized infants (newborns with birth weights of 3,000 to 4,500 gm) to healthy mothers in the Cleveland MIC sample averaged 33 lb for underweight, 32 lb for normal weight, 29 lb for overweight, and 19 lb for obese women. Except for obese women, rates and total amount of weight gain associated with the birth of healthy-sized infants were equivalent for the two samples.",

After families had received their public assistance and Food Stamp allotments for the month, a 24-hour recall was obtained each week from each family member so that food intake could be monitored from the recalls as food-buying resources were depleted. Although families bought most of their food the first 2 weeks, they maintained a relatively constant food intake through the last week of the month. However, when nutrient intakes were compared with Recommended Dietary Allowances, the diets were found to be well supplied in protein, ascorbic acid, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, and phosphorus, and inadequately supplied in vitamin B-6, vitamin D, vitamin E, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and pantothenic acid. Since that finding was true not just at the end of the month but from the beginning, it indicated that the nutrition problems of low-income families are not intermittent, but continuous.",

The panel of experts concluded that height and weight tables based on mortality data and the body mass index (BMI) are helpful measures to determine the presence of obesity and the need for treatment. For the dietitian, however, practical concerns arise regarding which index to select. The usefulness of the BMI in patient education and contradictions between the 1959 and 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance height-weight tables are discussed. A temporary solution is offered in light of the need for further investigation into morbidity experience at weights recommended in the 1983 table.",

Cultural foods education needs must be identified and evaluated so that they can be appropriately addressed in the nutrition and dietetics curriculums. Dietitians employed in California hospitals were surveyed to assess their cultural foods knowledge and determine cultural foods education needs. Demographic and opinion data were requested, and knowledge of the food habits of the six largest ethnic groups in the state was tested. California colleges and universities offering ADA Plan IV programs were sent questionnaires regarding the goals, content, and methodology of and the enrollment in cultural foods courses. Results of the dietitian survey (no. = 184; response rate 51%) showed a positive association (p less than .05) between the total score on the cultural foods knowledge test (average score = 62% correct) and completion of a college cultural foods course. Results of the Plan IV program survey (no. = 16; response rate 93%) indicate that 86% of the colleges and universities offer at least one cultural foods course. In 53% of those colleges and universities, Plan IV students are required to take such a course. Course content corresponds well to needs identified in the answers to the dietitian questionnaire. More emphasis on \"ethnic food habits\" and \"disease and food habits\" is recommended in the nutrition and dietetics curriculums.",

The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL. The ease of obtaining summary ratings from clinical personnel suggests that further exploration of this rapid quantification of patient health is warranted.",

An analysis of change in cognitive function (measured by the Folstein Mini-Mental State) and five global measures failed to reveal any differences between the depressed and nondepressed groups after a mean interval of 17 months.

Using chart review and interviews with the residents, it was found that multiple physical factors, including pain, strength, endurance, vision and balance, and multiple social and environmental factors, including the fear of falling, were related to the resident's decision to use a wheelchair as an alternative means of mobility. A physical examination focused on aspects of mobility was completed on each resident and was intended to characterize the physical limitations in groups studied. In the nursing home environment, use of the wheelchair is viewed by the residents as a self-initiated choice which the residents believed significantly enhanced their sense of well-being. Finally, there was minimal recognition of mobility as a problem on the part of the medical and nursing staff. The study raises a number of important issues concerning walking versus wheelchair use in the nursing home.",

Patients receiving major procedures had a significantly higher autopsy rate (38 versus 29%, P less than .05) but rates bore little relation to prognoses given at admission by house officers, suddenness of death, sex, marital status or year of admission. Even among intensively treated patients, autopsy rates decline strikingly with age, demanding honest re-appraisal to restore the place of autopsy in medical education, clinical research, and quality of care assessment for an increasingly elderly population.",

            "input": "Abstract: An analysis was completed of 34 patients with dementia who attended a mixed medical day care program over a five-year period. The parameters reviewed included age, home situation, diagnosis, incidence of co-existent medical disorders, management by the social worker, nurses and neuropsychiatrist, the extent of social and program participation, length of stay, and disposition. There was a high incidence of medical problems which were managed effectively because of close nursing observation, availability of ancillary services, specialty clinics, and frequent communication with the community physicians. The social worker assisted families with the management of long-term planning for the dementia patients and the entire social-nursing-recreational therapy team devised programs which encouraged the patients to function at an optimum level. Neuropsychiatric management, including drug therapy, was an integral part of the program. Despite the fact that the dementia patients were at high risk, with an average age of 81 years the average duration of attendance was two years four months and only nine of the 34 patients ultimately required nursing home placement. It was concluded that the day care program served as a resource which devised, integrated, and supervised, in cooperation with the community physicians, the support network and management strategies for the dementia patients.",

The disease is frequently characterized by cardiac, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As hyperthyroidism is readily amenable to effective treatment that can improve the quality of life, the clinical suspicion of this disease is always indicated and exclusion of this diagnosis should always be pursued. Recognizing the admittedly great difficulty in making, or even suspecting, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly, our rule is to test for hyperthyroidism in essentially all geriatric patients presenting chronic systemic symptoms or signs. On the other hand, we do not recommend community-wide screening of persons over 60 for hyperthyroidism. Community-wide screening falls far below the break-even point in cost-benefit analysis. The most sensible detector of hyperthyroidism now widely available is the serum free T3 index (FT3I), but it may be falsely normal because of the effect of systemic illness on extrathyroidal T4-to-T3 conversion. The advent of ultrasensitive methods for TSH may change these statements considerably. It may become the single screening procedure for both hyper- and hypothyroidism.",

One type was associated with submucosal fibromuscular hyperplasia and repair and appeared to be an early sinus. The second type was in dilated ileum or colon in the bases of ulcers and is designated an \"acute fissure.\" The anatomic findings suggest that both sinuses and fissures may be due to mechanical factors including intraluminal pressure rather than to any intrinsic quality of the inflammatory process in Crohn's disease.",

Increased cholinesterase activity was observed in nonobese as well as obese patients with fatty liver, whereas obese subjects without fatty liver showed levels in the upper normal range. When we set a cutoff level above the upper normal limit, half of the patients with fatty liver showed values above it, with only a few overlaps with other patients. When obese patients with fatty liver took a low-caloric diet, cholinesterase activity decreased, clearly reflecting improvement of hepatic steatosis. Thus, measurement of cholinesterase activity is of diagnostic value and an alternative to computed tomography in hepatic steatosis, and will provide a practical measure for the assessment of effects during follow-up.",

This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor.",

Moreover, in both man and mice, IgG antibodies to polysaccharides are predominantly, but not exclusively, restricted to a single IgG subclass--IgG2 in man, and IgG3 in the mouse. Because CBA/N mice have a deficiency of IgG3 antibodies and because human IgG2 subclass deficiencies have been generally associated with inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, it would seem likely that patients with WAS would have greatly reduced levels of IgG2. Quite to the contrary, the data presented here demonstrate that WAS patients have normal levels of the different IgG subclasses, including IgG2. Thus, inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrates is not always associated with IgG2 subclass deficiency.",

This study describes the potent in vivo effect of pertussigen on the levels of antigen-specific macrophage-activating lymphokine(s); lymphokine(s) was measured by the stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity (mPCA), or plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Lymphoid cells were removed from immunized animals and cultured with specific antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, ovalbumin, or human gamma-globulin. The culture supernatants were then incubated with the monocyte-like cell line WEHI-265 to measure mPCA or with WEHI-265 or resident peritoneal macrophages to measure PA activity. Mice were given pertussigen at the time of immunization, and the subsequent generation by lymphocyte supernatants of both of these macrophage activities proved to be greatly enhanced; the effect of pertussigen was antigen specific. Pertussigen thus induces an increase in lymphokine(s) production responsible for the in vitro increase in macrophage mPCA and PA activity and which may be responsible for some of the potent immune effects of this agent in vivo.",

Previously, it was demonstrated that IgG4 antibodies, in contrast to IgG1 antibodies, did not cross-link Sepharose-bound antigen and antigen added in solution. To eliminate the possibility that this phenomenon was caused by preferential binding of both IgG4 Fab fragments to the solid-phase-bound antigen, cross-linking of antigen was studied in a fluid-phase system. In this test, incapability of IgG4 antibodies to bridge two antigens was also found. As a result of such a phenomenon, it is expected that immune complexes formed by IgG4 antibodies will be considerably smaller than complexes formed by IgG1. This was confirmed by analysis of the molecular size profiles of IgG1- and IgG4-containing immune complexes in sucrose-density gradients. Moreover, IgG1 was able to precipitate antigen in a radioimmunoprecipitation test, whereas precipitation was not demonstrable by the same amount of IgG4 antibodies. Even 3% polyethylene glycol 8,000 did not precipitate the small IgG4-containing immune complexes efficiently. The antibodies studied were of a high-affinity type, and there was no significant difference in association constants between IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies. Therefore, we were not able to confirm observations reported in the literature that the IgG4 subclass is associated with a low-affinity antibody response; probably, the affinity of the IgG4 antibodies was underestimated by other investigators because of the polyethylene glycol precipitation technique used to separate antibody-bound and free antigen. Our findings stress the point that IgG4 antibodies take a special place in the immune response upon chronic exposure to antigen.",

Two parasite molecules have been implicated in the attachment event: Leishmania lipopolysaccharide (L-LPS) and a glycoprotein (gp63). This study was designed to clarify the role of L-LPS in infection and the stage in the process of infection at which it operates. We have recently identified a Leishmania major strain (LRC-L119) which lacks the L-LPS molecule and is not infective for hamsters or mice. This parasite was isolated from a gerbil in Kenya and was identified phenotypically as L. major by isoenzyme and fatty acid analysis. In this study we have confirmed at the genotype level that LRC-L119 is L. major by analyzing and comparing the organization of cloned DNA sequences in the genome of different strains of L. major. Here we show that LRC-L119 promastigotes are phagocytosed rapidly by macrophages in vitro, but in contrast to virulent strains of L. major, they are then killed over a period of 18 hr. In addition, we show that transfer of purified L-LPS from a virulent clone of L. major (V121) into LRC-L119 promastigotes confers on them the ability to survive in macrophages in vitro.",

We reasoned that cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL.

Both of these factors are antigen-specific and I-J+. GAT-TsF1 is not MHC-restricted and is composed of a single polypeptide chain, whereas GAT-TsF2 is MHC-restricted and is composed of two different polypeptide chains. We have not previously found evidence for an obligatory, idiotype-specific suppressor T cell in this suppressor pathway. However, we now report that idiotype-specific suppressor T cells can be elicited by exposing normal spleen cells to GAT-TsF1 or GAT-TsF2 in the absence of antigen in vitro. These factor (TsF1/TsF2)-induced cells have been fused with the AKR thymoma, BW5147, and hybridomas were selected for production of suppressor factors that inhibit GAT-specific antibody responses in vitro. In this report, we characterize one monoclonal factor from each fusion. Neither factor binds GAT or the related co-polymer, GT; both factors have binding sites for GAT-specific idiotypes but not for unrelated idiotypes either in the form of antibody immobilized on Sepharose or as cell surface determinants expressed by B cell hybridomas. Moreover, their reactivities for a panel of monoclonal anti-GAT antibodies are overlapping but not identical. Both factors are composed of two polypeptide chains, and both chains are required for suppressive activity; one chain bears the I-J determinant, whereas the other possesses the idiotype-binding activity of the intact molecule. Both idiotype-binding factors are restricted by MHC- and Igh-linked genes, and transcomplementation is observed in the F1 mice between MHC-congenic and Igh-congenic parents. Both factors are active late in Mishell-Dutton cultures. These data support the contention that these two factors are similar but nonidentical members of an anti-idiotypic class of GAT-specific suppressor factors.",

These results are compared with similar observations in college students with an acute, febrile, noninfluenzal respiratory illness that occurred during the same outbreak. The lymphopenia typical of influenza during acute illness was shown to be due to a reduction in both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. In addition, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A responses were reduced and NKC activity was increased, while pokeweed mitogen reactivity was unaltered at the time of admission to the study. Patients with noninfluenzal illness showed early polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a similar lymphopenia. Lymphocyte functions were virtually unchanged during acute illness in noninfluenza patients. The relatively specific alterations in lymphocyte responses to lectin-induced stimulation in influenza patients may indicate that the peripheral T cells are incapable of activation via the CD3 or CD2 activation pathways. In addition, increased NKC activity in the periphery may be reflective of increased NKC activity in the lung. Influenza-infected individuals with higher NKC activity at the time of admission to the study also took longer to recover. Finally, the early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza-infected patient may represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected respiratory tract as a consequence of infection.",

Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders.",

            "input": "Abstract: To investigate whether IgG antinuclear antibodies have cross-reactive rheumatoid factor activity, monoclonal IgG antibodies to DNA and Sm from autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice were assayed by ELISA for binding to IgG antigens. Of the nine anti-DNA and anti-Sm monoclonals tested, six showed significant binding to affinity-purified rabbit IgG (RIgG) and human IgG (HIgG). To confirm that cross-reactivities were due to a single antibody, immunoabsorption of a representative polyspecific monoclonal termed C11 (anti-DNA, anti-Sm) on either Sepharose-DNA or Sepharose-RIgG resulted in marked loss of activity to the three antigens DNA, Sm and RIgG compared with immunoabsorption on Sepharose-bovine serum albumin. The monomolecular nature of the cross-reacting antibody was also suggested by inhibition analysis of C11; DNA inhibited C11 binding to RIgG 64%, whereas Sm inhibited binding to RIgG 33%. Aggregated RIgG and HIgG, however, did not inhibit binding of C11 to DNA, Sm, or solid-phase RIgG, probably reflecting the low affinity of this antibody for fluid phase Ig. Together, these findings suggest that antinuclear autoantibodies of the IgG, as well as the IgM, class have polyspecific IgG binding activity and suggest that IgG antinuclear antibodies may emerge from rheumatoid factor responses.",

HepSS-1 also bound to a wide variety of established and fresh normal cells derived from not only mice but also other species such as human, monkey, rat, hamster, and chicken. Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types of GAG. From the binding analysis of HepSS-1 to various modified HS-GAG and whale omega-heparin, it is additionally suggested that HepSS-1 recognizes an epitope closely related to O-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine. We found that NIH 3T3 cells expressed more HepSS-1 epitopes at a low cell density than at confluency and in G2 + M than in G1, whereas NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Kirsten-ras oncogene or SV-40 expressed high levels of HepSS-1 epitopes and ceased to show the density-dependent change in the amount of HepSS-1 epitopes. These observations were also reproduced by using NIH 3T3 cells transformed with a temperature sensitive Kirsten murine sarcoma virus maintained at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Thus HepSS-1 is a first monoclonal antibody to HS-GAG and seems to be useful to elucidate changes in cell surface HS-GAG in normal cell growth and cell transformation.",

Because small cell lung carcinoma cells synthesize immunoreactive bombesin, we investigated the possibility that alveolar macrophages also contain bombesin, a plausible hypothesis considering the many reports of neuropeptide production by immune cells and cells of bone marrow origin. Adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found to contain bombesin.

Following the distribution of these bands in panels of somatic cell hybrids carrying various combinations of mouse chromosomes on a constant rat or Chinese hamster background allowed the localization of the C5-associated fragments to proximal chromosome 2 and the localization of the factor H-associated fragments to chromosome 1 or chromosome 3. Following the inheritance of DNA restriction fragment-length polymorphisms revealed by the probes in recombinant inbred mouse strains allowed the factor H-associated fragments to be mapped to Sas-1 on chromosome 1, and the C5-associated fragments to be mapped to Hc. Analysis of three-point crosses, in turn, placed the latter locus 19 cM distal to Sd on chromosome 2. We have designated the two loci Cfh and C5, respectively.

CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils, specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin.",

These recombinants included three recently developed strains, B10.ASR1, B10.ASR11, and B10.ASR12; and two strains B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT derived earlier. Although these recombinants were reciprocal in haplotype orientation to the three recombinants we reported recently, these too crossed over within the same 7 kb stretch of DNA in the E beta gene. This 7 kb stretch of DNA included the 3' half of the first intron, the beta 1 exon, the second intron, and the beta 2 exon. A comparison of the cDNA sequences of the two parental E beta alleles revealed that although the beta 2 exons were identical, there were several nucleotide differences between the two beta 1 exons. This allowed us to determine the parental origin of the beta 1 exon in the recombinants at the level of transcription by using S1 nuclease mapping. Thus we were able to show that in each case the 3' portion of the first intron and the beta 1 exon were upstream from the site of crossover. All eight recombinants involving the k and s haplotypes now can be mapped within a 4.5 kb stretch of DNA, which includes only the beta 1-beta 2 intron and the beta 2 exon of the E beta gene. These findings imply that the I-E molecules expressed in these recombinants will probably have conserved sequences and therefore will exhibit identical I-E-restricted immune responses, despite the fact that crossing over could have occurred at different sites within the beta 1-beta 2 intron.",

We established an assay system for the measurement of small amounts of anti-CPAg IgE antibody, both in an antigen-specific and isotype-specific manner, and a culture system to induce antigen-driven IgE antibody synthesis in vitro. By using these methods, we clarified that the function of the HLA-DR molecule in the CPAg-driven IgE response is similar to that of I-A or I-E molecule in mice, namely the product of immune response genes (Ir-genes), because anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody blocked the response, and the interaction between monocyte and monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to respond to CPAg was restricted by HLA-DR. Furthermore, PBL from nonresponders revealed a specific IgE response to CPAg when the Leu-2+3- T cell fraction was depleted, thereby suggesting that even nonresponders have Leu-2-3+ T cell and B cell clones specific for CPAg, and they apparently show no response due to the presence of CPAg-specific Leu-2+3- suppressor T cells. This suppressor T cell fraction abolished the IgE response of the autologous B + monocyte + Leu-2-3+ T cell in a CPAg-specific manner. The current cellular analysis together with our previous genetic analysis strongly suggest that the HLA-linked IgE nonresponse to CPAg is mediated by CPAg-specific suppressor T cells. The HLA-linked gene controlling the nonresponsiveness to CPAg is thus designated as the immune suppression gene for CPAg (Is-CPAg). Mapping of Is-CPAg within HLA-DQ subregion is discussed.",

Multiple animal models demonstrate increased rates of tumor dissemination after surgical stress; previously, we have observed that surgical stress impairs murine NKCC. Because of the importance of surgery in the control of solid tumors, it appeared valuable to examine the mechanism underlying surgical stress impairment of NKCC. The results of this study demonstrate that postsurgical suppression of NKCC begins as early as 2 hr after murine hind limb amputation, reaches nadir at 4 days, and does not recover to control level until postoperative day 12. Anesthetic treatment alone does not cause comparable NKCC suppression. The suppression of NKCC accompanied changes in both splenic size and morphology. The immune suppression was observed in multiple compartments including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Mixing experiments demonstrated that surgical stress per se generated a suppressor cell population affecting NKCC. The observed suppression apparently required cell-to-cell contact, because supernatants from 4 and 18 hr cultures of suppressor cells did not cause suppression. The observed suppression was prevented by perioperative treatment with the pyrimidinone analog 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4-pyrimidinol. These preclinical observations point to the future prospect of NK-specific perioperative immunotherapy that may help prevent possible tumor dissemination from occurring at the time of surgery.",

The surfactants were block copolymers of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) and hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) that differed in m.w., percentage of POE, and mode of linkage of POP to POE. The liposomes were haptenated with tripeptide-enlarged dinitrophenyl coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine, which was incorporated into the liposomal membrane. Additional injection of mice with surfactant stimulated serum hemagglutination titers and splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers to varying extents. Block polymers with POP chains flanking a POE center, as well as polymers with POE chains flanking a POP center, displayed high adjuvant activity. These block polymers stimulated the antibody response in a dose-dependent manner. They stimulated the antibody response with both high and low antigen doses. Furthermore, the addition of one of these adjuvants (25R1) reduced the amount of carrier lipid required in the liposome in order to obtain an optimal antibody response. The surfactants, which displayed high adjuvant activity, did not interfere with liposome stability as measured with a liposome lysis assay. Moreover, in vitro preincubation of liposomes with a block polymer did not affect their immunogenicity. Optimal adjuvant activity was observed when both adjuvant and liposomes were administered by the same route. Simultaneous injection of both components, however, is not a prerequisite. Conclusively, it can be stated that nonionic block polymer surfactants are potent adjuvants for stimulation of the antibody response against haptenated liposomes.",

We have found that human neutrophils resist complement lysis by the physical removal of membrane attack complexes by both endocytic and exocytic process. The latter mechanism predominates, vesiculation being detectable within 60 sec of initiating the complement cascade. Sixty-five percent of the formed complexes are removed on plasma membrane vesicles, although only 2% of the cell surface is lost. Ultrastructural examination revealed that these vesicles were covered with ring-like \"classical\" complement lesions. Analysis of these vesicles by gel electrophoresis indicated that C9 was present exclusively in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant, high m.w. complex. In contrast, the 35% of C9 that remained associated with the cells was found to be inaccessible to a C9-specific monoclonal antibody, and was partly degraded, suggesting internalization of the membrane attack complex and proteolysis of some C9 molecules. The molar ratio of C9 to C8 was 12 to 1 on shed vesicles and on recovered cells.",

In the present study, other peripheral blood cell types were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for the presence of C3dg binding activity. Specific uptake of C3dg occurred with neutrophils, platelets, and B lymphocytes, but not with eosinophils or T lymphocytes. Monocytes, contained within a mixed cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets, also bound C3dg, whereas purified monocytes did not. Binding of 125I-labeled glutaraldehyde-cross-linked C3dg to platelets was saturable, with an average of 1940 C3dg molecules bound per platelet at saturation (n = 8), ranging in number from 660 to 3930 molecules bound. Activation of platelets with thrombin did not consistently cause an increase in the expression of CR4 sites. 125I-C3dg binding to platelets was competitively inhibited equally well by unlabeled C3dg and iC3b, and approximately fourfold less well by C3b. The addition of platelets to elutriated monocytes generated C3dg binding activity on these cells by the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes. Thus, the CR4 on platelets accounted for the C3dg binding activity initially observed with partially purified monocytes. The adherent property of platelets may enable them to confer on certain other cell types the ability to localize C3dg-coated immune complexes or particles.",

LXA and three of its isomers were prepared by total organic synthesis and assayed for activity with human NK cells. Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. 6S-LXA, with its 6S-OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, 6S-11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and 6S-LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither 6S-11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting \"signals\" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi. Thus, this latter event may appear to be important in cytotoxicity.",

The generation of infective forms was related to their growth cycle and restricted to stationary stage organisms. Using immunofluorescence techniques, we have noticed that the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against L. braziliensis (VD5/25) increased progressively as the promastigotes developed in culture and was maximal with the infective forms. This antigenic differentiation was not detected with an anti-L. braziliensis polyclonal rabbit antiserum, suggesting that only a few epitopes, including that recognized by VD5/25, have their expression effectively increased on the surface of infective promastigotes. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of surface-iodinated L. braziliensis promastigotes with this mAb revealed two proteins of apparent 65,000 and 50,000 Mr, the 50,000 Mr protein probably representing the unreduced form of the major surface glycoprotein described in several species of Leishmania (GP65). The increasing expression of this epitope was not found with L. chagasi promastigotes, but seems to occur with the parasites from the L. mexicana complex. Intracellular survival of L. braziliensis was completely inhibited when the infective promastigotes were treated with VD5/25. It appears, therefore, that the increasing expression of GP65 on the promastigote surface represents an essential mechanism of leishmania survival in the macrophage.",

The skin of normal guinea pigs failed to develop any cutaneous changes after inoculation with either dead spores or mycelia. In contrast, guinea pigs that had recovered from a T. mentagrophytes infection reacted to topically applied spores by producing pustules but failed to develop pustules either grossly or microscopically when inoculated with mycelia. Because differences in the activation of C' and the subsequent generation of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant, C5a, might account for our in vivo findings, we measured the amount of C5a activated in vitro when serum was incubated with equivalent amounts of spores or mycelia. Spores consistently activated more C' to C5a than mycelia, although each could activate serum C'. The results support previous studies that show a direct correlation between the clinical manifestations of a dermatophytic infection and the development of immunity against the dermatophyte. Furthermore, the data suggest that a dermatophyte's predominant morphology during an infection may play a critical role in producing pustules by activating C' and chemoattracting PMNs into the fungus-laden stratum corneum.",

In the present study, I examined whether anhidrosis, a cardinal feature of CST, is present in the putative mouse sex-linked model, Tabby.

In vitro investigation of this phenomenon has been hampered by the fastidious nature of the human epidermal melanocyte, which has proven difficult to cultivate. The present study compares responsiveness of cultured human epidermal melanocytes and established melanoma cell lines to serum, cholera toxin, and melanocyte growth factor (MGF), three established melanocyte mitogens. Four of four established human melanoma lines were substantially stimulated by fetal bovine serum, as were newborn foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes. In contrast, none of the four melanoma lines responded to hypothalamic preparations containing MGF that consistently produced an approximately 30-fold increase in newborn melanocyte cell yield over a 2-week period. Cholera toxin, required for successful establishment of primary melanocyte cultures, had small and variable effects on the melanoma lines, with slight stimulation in one case, moderate inhibition in another, and essentially no effect in two others. These data suggest that transformation of epidermal melanocytes to melanoma often involves at least one phenotypic change resulting in escape from MGF regulation and another associated with insensitivity to cyclic AMP modulation; while at least some of the pathways conferring serum dependence are unaltered. Improved culture systems for the human epidermal melanocyte should facilitate further studies into the mechanism of its malignant conversion and may provide useful insights for the prevention and treatment of human melanoma.",

This enzyme activity was confirmed by its purification from cultures of stratified human keratinocytes by affinity column chromatography. The enzyme was assayed both in vivo and in vitro using a spin-labeled quaternary ammonium compound as the substrate, under saturating conditions in free radical substrate. Specific activities were determined by monitoring the sequential decrease in the amplitude of the electron spin resonance signal per unit of cell protein. The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase.",

Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear. It is speculated that the charged gold particles are not completely coated by the stabilizing protein, allowing for an electrostatic interaction with charged proteins in sections of cells.",

It was thus possible to determine lipid concentrations in 12 consecutive epidermal layers, extending 96 microns into the skin.

Glucosylceramide and acylglucosylceramide reached a peak concentration in the stratum granulosum and then decreased in the surface layers. Cholesterol sulfate reached a maximum concentration in the deeper stratum corneum and then abruptly decreased in the surface layer. These changes in patterns of lipid concentration are consistent with current theories regarding the formation of a water barrier in the stratum corneum that is composed mainly of neutral lipids, and with a possible function of cholesterol sulfate in cellular adhesion in the stratum corneum.",

Whereas epibolin alone in defined medium supports some cell spreading, the purified plasma coepibolin preparations do not effect spreading in the absence of epibolin. Although not yet entirely purified, coepibolin associates with some plasma fractions but not with others; it is certainly not a property of all proteins, e.g., while bovine serum albumin (BSA) has coepibolin activity, ovalbumin does not. The data presented here show that the phorbol ester, 12-tetra-decanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can act as a potent coepibolin and support maximal spreading over a concentration range of 10-100 ng/ml. In the absence of epibolin TPA does not stimulate the spreading of epidermal cells when given alone or in the presence of BSA or ovalbumin. Coepibolin activity appears to associate with tumor-promoting activity in that the phorbol derivative, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, shows coepibolin activity, while its inactive non-tumor-promoting isomer, phorbol-4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, does not.

In order to further elucidate the significance of lipids in the water-holding properties, lipids, which were extracted as sebaceous-rich lipids (SL) for the first 10-min acetone/ether treatment and as stratum corneum lipids (SCL) for the additional 30-min treatment, were topically applied daily on lipid-depleted forearm skin which had been pretreated with acetone/ether for 40 min. Two daily applications of the SCL which were solubilized in squalane containing 1% alpha-monomethyl heptadecyl glyceryl ether (GE) caused a significant increase of conductance, accompanied by a marked improvement in the level of scaling as compared with nontreatment or GE/squalane base, whereas the SL in the GE/squalane base did not exhibit any significant recovery in either conductance value or scaling. To clarify which components of the SCL are primarily responsible for the observed recovery of the water-holding properties, chromatographically separated fractions of the SCL were also topically applied in the same manner for 2 successive days. Out of the following separated fractions: cholesterol, cholesterol ester, free fatty acid, glycolipids, and ceramide, 2 daily topical applications of ceramide fraction induced a significant and the highest increase in the conductance value as compared with GE/squalane base. Furthermore, glycolipids and cholesterol fractions also exhibited a significant recovery when compared with no application at all. In contrast, free fatty acid and cholesterol ester fractions did not indicate any significant increase in the conductance value. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that structural lipids present in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum, especially ceramide, play a critical role in the water-holding properties of the stratum corneum.",

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis.",

            "input": "Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effect of middle-wave ultraviolet (UVB) radiation on mast cell functions using mouse ear skin as an in vivo model. Groups of UVB-irradiated BALB/c mice were given an intradermal injection of the mast cell degranulator compound 48/80 into ears at various time intervals (30 min-7 days) after a single exposure to a bank of fluorescent sunlamp tubes (10-100 mJ/cm2). Both the compound-evoked ear swelling response (ESR) and mast cell degranulation were significantly suppressed by preexposure to UVB (25-100 mJ/cm2) after 0 (30 min) to 3 days postirradiation, with a subsequent recovery by day 7. No such effects were observed in mice irradiated with 10 mJ/cm2. The ESR induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine was not significantly affected by UVB radiation during the experimental period. While within this dose range UV radiation itself caused neither loss of mast cell counts nor a measurable degree of degranulation in ear skin, exposure to larger amounts of UV energy (200-500 mJ/cm2) produced tremendous ear swelling with histologic features of mast cell degranulation in an early phase of inflammation. The results suggest that UVB radiation exerts a dual effect on mast cells and that administration of smaller amounts of UVB may alter the mast cell/vasoactive amine system, suppressing ear swelling in response to the degranulator. Vascular reactivities to vasoactive amines were not affected by UVB irradiation.",

            "input": "Abstract: The origin of Merkel cells is still a matter of debate, specifically the question of whether they are derived from epithelial cells of the epidermis or from immigrated neural crest cells. As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated Merkel cells in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of Merkel cells in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. Merkel cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17-week-old fetus, 17% of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) Merkel cells were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14-week-old fetus only 3.9% of the Merkel cells were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal Merkel cells. Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal Merkel cells per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7- to 9-week embryos, no Merkel cells were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of Merkel cells or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin Merkel cells arise, between weeks 8-12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal Merkel cells detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves.",

The temporal association of soft hemolysis with rubella was determined with sera obtained from 129 persons during late convalescence (70-310 days after onset of symptoms). Soft hemolysis disappeared by 190 days after the onset of symptoms and the presence of ordinary hemolysis ruled out primary rubella in the preceding 70-100 days.

One was a 1-4 scale based on a subjective evaluation of embryo quality (EQ) from microscopic appearance. In addition, a formula for scoring embryo growth rate in vitro was developed. The embryo development rating (EDR) was based on the ratio between the time at which embryos were observed at a particular stage after insemination and the time at which they would be expected to reach that stage in a hypothetical \"ideal\" growth rate with a cell cycle length of 11.9 hr. Using this scoring system, \"normally\" growing embryos scored 100. This approach was aimed at partially normalizing the data and allowed all embryos to be analyzed similarly regardless of the time of observation. Analysis of 1539 embryo replacements resulting in 232 clinical pregnancies showed that both EDR and embryo-quality scores were of value in predicting success, with clinical pregnancy most likely to eventuate from a combination of moderate to good EQ scores (2-4) coupled with average or above-average growth rates (EDR scores from 90 to 129). Poor-quality and very slowly or very rapidly growing embryos were underrepresented in cycles that proceeded to pregnancy. These inferences were based on all embryos transferred (mean, 2.73 per transfer cycle), and they were substantiated by an analysis of 33 pregnancies resulting from replacement of a single embryo and from 18 pregnancies in which all embryos scored the same with both systems. EQ and EDR were significantly associated with each other and together provide a valuable guide in predicting pregnancy, in selecting embryos for freezing, and in monitoring day-to-day performance in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) program.",

The AGN cases were both postpharyngeal and postpyodermal in origin. Despite the fact that ARF and AGN were occurring in the same neighborhoods and among families of equivalent size and socioeconomic status, the pharyngeal isolation rates of group A streptococci were significantly lower among patients with ARF and their household contacts than among patients with AGN and their contacts. Moreover, the streptococcal throat colonization rates and geometric mean anti-streptolysin O titers were similar in ARF families and the families of noninfected controls. Streptococci of M-type 5, a highly rheumatogenic type, were isolated from three patients with ARF (representing 36% of group A isolates from this group) and one ARF contact but never from patients with AGN, control subjects, or their respective contacts. These observations suggest possible differences in the streptococcal milieus from which ARF and AGN cases emerge. The nature of such differences requires further exploration.",

Cardiac output and regional blood flow were measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in rats with portal hypertension caused by portal vein stenosis, in rats with end-to-side portacaval shunts, and in sham-operated rats. Cardiac output was significantly higher in rats with surgical shunts than in those of the two other groups and was significantly lower in sham-operated rats compared with portal hypertensive rats. Portal tributary blood flow and hepatic arterial blood flow expressed in absolute flow as well as in percentage of cardiac output were significantly increased in rats with surgical shunts compared with other groups. These blood flows were also significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated animals. A significant correlation was found between cardiac output and portal tributary blood flow in rats with portal vein stenosis and in rats with surgical shunts; this correlation was absent in sham-operated rats. This study shows that the hyperkinetic circulatory state in rats with portal hypertension and a normal liver is related to the presence of portasystemic shunts but not to portal hypertension per se.",

Previously the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3) was found to be inappropriately low in SHR in view of their ionized hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. We examined the responses of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 to several known stimuli. Baseline plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels tended to be lower in SHR than WKY rats (51.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 82.3 +/- 14.1 pg/ml, P = 0.06). Infusion of a pharmacologic dose of parathyroid hormone (8 U/hr over a period of 17 hours) resulted in a plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 504 +/- 77 pg/ml in SHR vs. 1016 +/- 211 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.03). Cyclic adenosine monophosphate infusion (1 mumol/hr/100 gm over a period of 17 hours) in thyroparathyroidectomized animals resulted in a 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 121 +/- 24 pg/ml in SHR vs. 557 +/- 26 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.01). After dietary phosphorus depletion for 3 weeks, SHR also had lower 1,25(OH)2D3 levels than WKY rats (83 +/- 13 vs. 300 +/- 42 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) even though a comparable degree of hypophosphatemia was achieved. Thus, the response of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels to several known stimuli is submaximal in SHR as compared with WKY rats, suggesting defective synthesis or enhanced metabolic clearance of this hormone.",

In addition, we noticed a cumulative prolongation of bleeding time by a combination of quinidine and aspirin. We postulated that because both quinidine and aspirin inhibit epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a cumulative effect of the two drugs might be responsible for the hemostatic defect. In studies using normal human platelets, we confirmed a marked reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation by the combination of these two agents. To further study the potential mechanism of this cumulative effect, platelet lysates were incubated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist tritiated yohimbine in the presence of quinidine and aspirin. On the basis of the radioligand binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was observed to increase in the presence of quinidine as well as aspirin. The combination of these two agents caused a marked increase in the KD of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors without alteration in the number of receptor sites. These data suggest that the cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor KD may relate to the significant reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. This phenomenon, coupled with other well-known effects of aspirin on the platelet release reaction and arachidonate metabolism, may lead to bleeding problems in some patients receiving this combination.",

Cigarette smoking, which also produces chronic pulmonary inflammation, may be associated with iron accumulation in alveolar macrophages (AM). We have examined the total iron content in human AM and found it to be 43.0 +/- 7.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 12.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/1 X 10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) from smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Because the higher iron content in smokers' macrophages may reflect increased internalization, the binding and uptake of iron-saturated transferrin was examined in cells from smokers and nonsmokers. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups. The smoking-related alteration in iron content may instead reflect differences in the fate of internalized iron. Iron internalized by AM as iron 59 initially bound to transferrin was distributed to a cytoplasmic, largely ferritin-associated, pool more slowly in smokers than in nonsmokers, during a 24-hour incubation in vitro. Significantly less newly internalized iron was returned to the culture medium by AM from smokers, which by 24 hours had released 11.0% +/- 3.7% of the initially internalized 59Fe compared with 36.0% +/- 2.3% for nonsmokers (P less than 0.01). The increased accumulation of iron by AM in the alveolar space of smokers may modulate hydroxyl radical production in the microenvironment of these cells.",

The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC. Furthermore, it was suggested that TU infusion at a higher rate significantly interferes with the hepatic uptake (or storage) of BSP.",

The derived microvesicles from each line were as effective as the intact cells in inducing thrombogenesis on both undigested and alpha-chymotrypsin-digested subendothelium. Thrombus size on digested vessels was greater than on undigested vessels by fivefold for SKNMC cells and microvesicles and by 20-fold for U87MG cells and sevenfold for U87MG microvesicles. The results show that microvesicles from both cell lines initiate interactions between platelets and subendothelium identical to those caused by intact tumor cells. The results also demonstrate that intact tumor cells in the circulation may not be necessary for the thromboembolic complications of malignancy.",

To differentiate between these mechanisms, we investigated the quantity and character of protein excretion in 10 patients with pancreatitis. For a short period of time, seven of 10 patients had mild proteinuria with a mean protein excretion rate of 230 +/- 154 mg/24 hr. Proteinuria decreased in 9/9 survivors to 17 +/- 18 mg/24 hr. Albumin excretion rate initially was minimally increased in 10/10 patients with a mean of 61 +/- 40 mg/24 hr, decreasing during recovery in 8/9 survivors to 10.9 +/- 10.4 mg/24 hr (P less than 0.01). Electrophoresis of urine obtained during the acute phase consistently showed a low molecular weight proteinuria pattern that cleared with recovery. Twenty-one of 22 urinary samples with an elevated CAM/CCR had a low molecular weight protein pattern. All the above findings can be explained by alterations in renal tubular reabsorption of proteins without changes in glomerular permeability. In 2/4 patients a low molecular weight protein was present in urine specimens from the acute phase that was not present in highly concentrated urine specimens from the recovery period. This raises the possibility that an abnormal low molecular weight protein enters the serum in acute pancreatitis, which, after glomerular filtration, produces the renal tubular malfunction found in acute pancreatitis.",

Three patient populations were identified for comparison: patients admitted by private family physicians when residents were not involved in patient care, patients admitted by the same family physicians while they served as attending physicians on the family practice service and allowed residents to participate in the care of their patients, and patients admitted by residents from the patient population at the Family Practice Center. After taking into account differences in case mix, an analysis of laboratory charges, radiology use, frequency of procedures, and use of consultants showed that the three groups were not different. Family practice residents managed their own patients as cost effectively as physicians in private practice, which suggests that experience alone is not necessary to develop methods of cost-efficient care. When these two groups were combined into a teaching unit, with few exceptions this efficiency was maintained. These results imply that the introduction of family practice residents into patient care does not invariably increase expenses to the patient.",

Isoelectric focusing of phosphoglucomutase-1 was accomplished in 80 min in a 0.2-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel with an interelectrode wick distance of 8.0 cm. The gel contained 1.2% (w/v) N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N-3-propanesulfonic acid (EPPS) and pH 5 to 7 ampholytes (4% w/v). When maintained at room temperature, laboratory-prepared bloodstains and semen stains could be typed for phosphoglucomutase-1 up to four months and three weeks, respectively. An evaluation of phosphoglucomutase-1 typing by isoelectric focusing and the Group I system was performed on casework samples submitted to the FBI Laboratory. In addition to the increased discriminating probability of phosphoglucomutase-1 when subtyped, isoelectric focusing yielded an increase in positive calls on questioned bloodstains (65.6 versus 36.2%) and dried seminal stains (16.4 versus 13.1%) compared with the Group I system.",

The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration in vitreous fluid was more than 20 times higher in the cold exposed animals than in controls (44.2 +/- 9.2 versus 2.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL). Autolysis alone caused an increase to 33.5 +/- 7.7 ng/mL, and freezing alone to 13.4 +/- 5.3 ng/mL. The highest values were in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. Adrenaline (A) concentration in the vitreous fluid increased fourfold (3.9 +/- 1.5 versus 0.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL) in cold exposure and twofold as a result of autolysis. Dopamine (DA) concentration in vitreous fluid was elevated only in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. The increase of NA concentration in urine was fivefold during the whole exposure (from 19.4 +/- 6.9 to 109 +/- 57.3 ng/mL), but A was increased by twentyfold (from 10 +/- 5.1 to 213.2 +/- 168.7 ng/mL), whereas DA concentration did not change. The increase of average excretion of NA to urine was eightfold during the first 6 h of exposure, and that of A tenfold. According to the present results, elevated concentrations of catecholamines in the vitreous fluid and urine can be used as a diagnostic aid for hypothermia death. Concerning the values of noradrenaline in the vitreous, the increase as a result of autolysis must be taken in account when interpreting the results.",

In addition, the influence of age on morphometric dimensions and the soft tissue cover was tested. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that nasal height and nasal length are best predicted by the dimensions of the skull, whereas nasal depth and the thickness of the soft tissues is greatly influenced by age. In males, over 50% of the variance of nasal height and nasal length were accounted for by the height of the bony nose and the prominence of the ossa nasalia, and in females it was about 40%. Although the thickness of the soft tissue is dependent on exogenous factors, such as nutrition, mimicry, and so forth, the dimensions of the bony nose apparently also influence the skin depths to some extent. High and prominent noses were found to have a thinner layer of soft tissue over the nasal bones than short and less prominent ones. It thus seems as if there is a tendency of the soft tissue cover to adjust to disharmonies of the bony profile.",

Gastric contents and urine were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, and nasal swabs, blood, and urine were tested for the combination of cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine by quantitative radioimmunoassay. A total of seventy-two deaths in Pima County from 1982 to 1984 have involved cocaine. Seventy percent of these have occurred in the last fifteen months. Marked variation in the individual response to cocaine compared to the blood concentration of cocaine/metabolite was noted.",

Review of the literature and the comparison with blood dicyclomine values from four rabbits given equivalent doses suggests that a blood dicyclomine value of 200 ng/mL probably is in the therapeutic range for infants. Although safely used for years for infantile colic, recently, the administration of dicyclomine has been related to acute episodes of apnea, seizures, and coma.

This study followed the treatment progress of 20 patients for a mean of 39 months after intake. The study included a detailed history, neurological examination, and psychological testing on each patient. At follow-up each patient was interviewed and a questionnaire was completed by his or her therapist to assess treatment response. Although nine patients achieved partial or full integration, complete integration was maintained by only five. During therapy the unintegrated patients experienced emotional trauma at approximately twice the rate as did the patients who eventually became integrated. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and hypnosis were the most widely prescribed therapies. The improvement in multiple personality appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion from acceptance of the diagnosis to integration. The progress of therapy was hindered most commonly by the overuse of the mental mechanisms of repression and denial, the continued utilization of secrecy, which began during child abuse, and the production of numerous crises. The most common countertransferences included anger, exasperation, and emotional exhaustion. Although the psychotherapy of patients with multiple personality is tedious and time consuming, it can be eminently successful if the patient and therapist persevere.",

Dissociation occurs to some degree in normal individuals and is thought to be more prevalent in persons with major mental illnesses. The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has been developed to offer a means of reliably measuring dissociation in normal and clinical populations. Scale items were developed using clinical data and interviews, scales involving memory loss, and consultations with experts in dissociation. Pilot testing was performed to refine the wording and format of the scale. The scale is a 28-item self-report questionnaire. Subjects were asked to make slashes on 100-mm lines to indicate where they fall on a continuum for each question. In addition, demographic information (age, sex, occupation, and level of education) was collected so that the connection between these variables and scale scores could be examined. The mean of all item scores ranges from 0 to 100 and is called the DES score. The scale was administered to between 10 and 39 subjects in each of the following populations: normal adults, late adolescent college students, and persons suffering from alcoholism, agoraphobia, phobic-anxious disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and multiple personality disorder. Reliability testing of the scale showed that the scale had good test-retest and good split-half reliability. Item-scale score correlations were all significant, indicating good internal consistency and construct validity. A Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc comparisons of the scores of the eight populations provided evidence of the scale's criterion-referenced validity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes.",

Although methods of ascertainment are not standardised, regional differences and changes with time are present for each of these statistics. Mortality has declined, whereas prevalence and hospital discharge rates have increased owing in part to the improved survival but also to better case ascertainment. The gradient in prevalence seen between Southern England (63/10(5)), Northern England and Northern Ireland (76-79/10(5)), Wales (c. 113/10(5)), North-East Scotland (155/10(5)) and the Orkneys (258/10(5)) can in part be attributed to varying methods of ascertainment but correlates with regional differences in the frequency of HLA-DR2 in normal individuals (21-50%). However no HLA-DR2 association is observed in parts of Scotland, where the prevalence is the highest in the United Kingdom, because HLA-DR2 and linked genes occur in up to 50% of the normal population from these areas. If the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is multifactorial the frequency of the disease will increase where susceptibility genes are common because the probability of concurrence of the remaining critical events is high; conversely when each aetiological agent is infrequent the chance of them all occurring in the same individual and therefore incidence of the disease are both lower. The fall in incidence observed in the Orkney Islands, possibly reflecting decline in an exogenous agent interacting with susceptibility factors, is consistent with this multifactorial hypothesis.",

In contrast, patients who present with hydrocephalus, large supratentorial cysts, multiple granulomata with cerebral oedema or with vasculitis and cerebral infarction, have an aggressive, acute or subacute illness, presenting with raised intracranial pressure, gait disturbances, mental changes, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hemisphere syndromes, chronic meningitis and stroke.

The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide also increased during viloxazine therapy, but to a lesser extent (16%). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of viloxazine. In a seventh patient, viloxazine had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide levels (by 197% and 137% respectively). Although viloxazine appears to be one of the few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine. The mechanism of the interaction probably involves inhibition of the metabolism of both carbamazepine and its active epoxide metabolite.",

The subjects were requested to draw on a graphic tablet triangles and squares of different size and shape. The patients produced a larger number of EMG burst compared with controls. The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories.",

The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic mechanism involved in the generation of VEP delays is sensitive to stimulus spatial frequency. The study of VEPs before and after the administration of haloperidol confirmed this hypothesis. VEP latency did not correlate with the major clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could not predict the results of chronic dopaminergic therapy.",

In addition, the angle of the elbow with the arm fully relaxed and no external torque applied (\"neutral\" angle) was found to be 107 degrees +/- 10 degrees. Thus, we have quantified resting stiffness or \"tone\" in the arm and provided normal data for comparison with patients with pathophysiological conditions such as rigidity or spasticity.",

In Parkinsonian versus normal patients (previously reported) it was observed that: the neutral angle in Parkinson's disease patients was significantly smaller (92 degrees +/- 15 degrees) than in normals (107 degrees +/- 10 degrees), and in Parkinson's disease patients, even with relatively mild symptoms, the upper limb was stiffer than normals in the totally relaxed state with no electromyographic activity present. Our results suggest that changes in the passive mechanical properties of the upper limb affected by Parkinsonian rigidity may have taken place, accounting for the more flexed neutral elbow angle and greater passive stiffness. Using this technique, response to antirigidity therapy and natural progression of illness can be quantitatively assessed and followed.",

Empiric correction was made by the computer for the effects of density and viscosity, relative to air, on the flow of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the saturated vapors of the three anesthetics through the capillary resistor. The computer was programmed to control solenoid valves both for calibration and for the multiplexed sampling of operating rooms.

            "input": "Abstract: Both halothane and nitrous oxide can be reduced at the cathode of a polarographic oxygen electrode, causing the electrode current to drift upward and report falsely high oxygen tension. Because transcutaneous oxygen tension is measured by a heated oxygen electrode, there is a potential for significant upward drift of these values. To examine the clinical significance of this drift, the following study was performed. Transcutaneous oxygen tension sensors were calibrated at oxygen tensions of 0 mm Hg and 157 mm Hg (room air) just before clinical use during anesthesia. This calibration was rechecked immediately upon removal of the sensor from the patient at the end of the anesthesia. The predominant anesthetic agent used and the duration of monitoring were noted from the record. Data were collected from 208 patients representing a total of 463.6 hours of anesthesia. The patients were divided into five groups based on anesthetic administered: halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, nitrous oxide-narcotic, and local/regional. The mean zero point recalibration value was 0.4 mm Hg or less for all agents except halothane, for which it was 1.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. This halothane drift was significantly greater than that for the other agents (P less than 0.01). Room air recalibration was not significantly different in any of the five groups, varying from 160 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for halothane to 157 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for enflurane. All these drift values are within the manufacturer's specifications. We conclude that the drift of the transcutaneous oxygen tension sensor due to anesthetic agents is not clinically significant. However, caution should be exercised when halothane is used during an extremely long period of anesthesia.",

In development of the system, emphasis was placed on providing an anesthesiologist-computer interface that can be adapted to typical situations during anesthesia and to individual user behavior. One main feature of this interface is the integration of the input and output of information. The only device for interaction between the anesthesiologist and the AIS is a touch-sensitive, high-resolution color display screen. The anesthesiologist enters information by touching virtual function keys displayed on the screen. A data window displays all data generated over time, such as automatically recorded vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal and esophageal temperatures, and manually entered variables, such as administered drugs, and ventilator settings. The information gathered by the AIS is presented on the cathode ray tube in several pages. A main distributor page gives an overall view of the content of every work page. A one-page record of the anesthesia is automatically plotted on a multicolor digital plotter during the operation. An example of the use of the AIS is presented from a field test of the system during which it was evaluated in the operating room without interfering with the ongoing operation. Medical staff who used the AIS imitated the anesthesiologist's recording and information search behavior but did not have responsibility for the conduct of the anesthetic.",

Monitoring is deemed necessary to avoid problems, although there is little hard evidence that a specific monitor will improve outcome. The risk associated with modern noninvasive monitors, however, is negligible, and they should be considered for routine use in all patients. Although errors in the variables displayed or misuse of correct information can cause difficulties, these result from a lack of education and are not a valid reason to abandon a particular monitoring modality. Regular use of such monitoring tools as the electroencephalogram would allow clinicians to become familiar with how to interpret it in normal and crisis situations. The cost of a disaster during anesthesia (such as unrecognized hypoxia) is high. The dollars spent to cover a single major malpractice award could buy a tremendous number of monitors. The state of the art in the mid-1980s demands traditional anesthesia monitors plus continuous capnography and measurement of peripheral oxygenation. Other negligible-risk monitors should also be used when feasible. Improvement in monitoring design, particularly in output formats and in integration of monitored data, will be essential in the next few years, as will training in the proper use of monitors.",

Hormonal manipulation was performed in all groups.

Clinical assessment of tumor aggressiveness, nodal status, type of chemotherapy administered, and early response to chemotherapy (by third course) were all prognostic factors.

A new quality of life-oriented endpoint was defined to assist in the selection of therapeutic approach after surgery for postmenopausal patients: the time without symptoms of disease and subjective toxic effects of treatment (TWiST). Despite the larger initial discount due to subjective toxicity with chemoendocrine therapy, by 5 years postmastectomy the net difference in average TWiST for treated patients compared with the observation group was positive and approximately equal for both adjuvant treatment programs. Adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy for postmenopausal women appears to be justified due to an emerging OS advantage and increasing TWiST gained for the treated patients.",

            "input": "Abstract: Although increased efficacy has been described with a five-day schedule of high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) in hypertonic saline, severe myelosuppression and cumulative neurotoxicity have limited the usefulness of this therapy. In order to evaluate a possible dose-response relationship in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 17 patients with metastatic disease were treated with a modified dose schedule delivering the same total dose (200 mg/m2) in a divided day 1 and 8 schedule. During a pilot study, a total of 47 cycles of therapy were administered, with a median of three cycles per patient and a median total cumulative dose of 600 mg/m2. Nine of 17 patients received at least 600 mg/m2. While nephrotoxicity was similar to previous reports of the five-day schedule, the incidence and severity of myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy were markedly reduced. Using this modified schedule, severe myelosuppression did not occur. Clinically severe peripheral neuropathy developed in only one patient (6%). The overall response rate was 47% (eight of 17 patients). Plasma platinum pharmacokinetics during five cycles of the modified day 1 and 8 schedule were compared with pharmacokinetics of the five-day schedule. Accumulation of plasma ultrafiltrate platinum occurred in the five-day schedule, but not in the day 1 and 8 schedule. This difference in pharmacokinetics is one possible explanation for the reduced toxicity of this modified schedule. Although the degree of activity seen in this pilot study is encouraging, the efficacy of high-dose CDDP in NSCLC remains to be defined. In view of reduced myelosuppression and neurotoxicity, further trials with this modified schedule are indicated.",

Group 1 (n = 12) underwent treatment at low dose, less than 0.35 mg/kg, or low temperature, less than 38 degrees C. Group 2 (n = 30) received higher doses, 0.35 to 0.6 mg/kg, plus heat at 38 degrees C to 41 degrees C. No patient had evidence of disease outside the limb at the time of perfusion. The median follow-up time was 48 months (range, 1 to 9 years). Of the 42 patients, 29 had measurable lesions that responded as follows: group 1, complete response (CR) in two of ten and partial response (PR) in none; group 2, CR in six of 19 and PR in six of 19. The combined CR and PR rate of 12 of 19 in group 2 was significantly higher than that of group 1 (P less than .05). CR lasted only 2 months in the two patients of group 1, but persisted in the six patients of Group 2, four of whom are still alive free of disease at 16, 21, 33, and 40 months. Relapse-free control of disease in the limb was achieved in 36% of the patients in group 2 at 24 months, compared with 0% in group 1 (P less than .05). An overall survival of 74% at 48 months was observed in group 2, significantly higher than that of 64% for group 1 (P less than .05). The status of the regional lymph nodes (RLN) and the number of metastases did not affect tumor response. However, 77% of RLN-negative patients survived 48 months, in contrast to only 38% of RLN-positive patients (P less than .05). One patient died postoperatively of myocardial infarction. No serious systemic toxicity developed. Two patients who underwent repeat salvage perfusions developed a reversible peripheral neuropathy in the limb. Limb function was good after treatment, and dramatically improved in patients who had advanced satellitosis that responded to treatment. These results suggest that heated limb perfusion using mechlorethamine at an adequate dose can offer long-term control of intransit metastases in approximately one third of these patients, with preservation of good limb function and possible prolongation of survival.",

            "input": "Abstract: Several preclinical and clinical studies have documented that dose or dose intensity of chemotherapeutic agents are important factors for response of patients' tumors. This finding has prompted empiric trials of certain chemotherapeutic agents in high-dose or regional administration treatment regimens. The present study was performed to identify agents that would be particularly good candidates for high-dose or regional administration regimens against particular types of tumors. Using a human tumor cloning technique, we constructed dose in vitro response lines for ten different chemotherapeutic agents against seven different histologic types of malignancies. Slopes of the lines indicated the agents with the greatest increases of in vitro response per increment in dose of the agent. Tumors against which the agents gave the steepest dose response lines included lymphoma, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, and small-cell lung cancer, while the dose response lines for non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer were quite flat. Suggestions for clinical trials based on these findings include the use of high-dose melphalan for patients with lymphoma, head and neck, and ovarian cancer; the use of mitoxantrone in high-dose regimens for patients with breast cancer; high-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with small-cell lung cancer; high-dose bleomycin regimens for patients with non-small-cell lung and head and neck cancer; and regional perfusion of liver metastases from colorectal cancer with cisplatin. Prospective testing of high-dose or regional administration regimens suggested by this new model should indicate its use for prediction of the best agent to use in high-dose regimens against a particular tumor type.",

Although HMBA demonstrated no antineoplastic activity in preclinical testing, it was selected for clinical development on the basis of its potent differentiating capabilities in vitro. In this phase I study, HMBA was administered as a continuous five-day infusion every 3 weeks to patients with advanced cancer. Twenty-three patients received 35 evaluable courses at doses that ranged from 4.8 to 33.6 g/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities included renal insufficiency, a hyperchloremic metabolic acidemia/acidosis, and CNS toxicities manifested by agitation and delirium, which progressed to coma in one patient who developed concomitant renal insufficiency. Moderate myelosuppression, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting were also observed. The pharmacokinetics of HMBA best fit a single compartmental model and disposition is primarily by renal elimination. Renal excretion of HMBA and of the primary metabolite, 6-acetoamidohexanoic acid, together account for the disposition of 66% to 93% (mean, 74%) of the infused drug. Based on this trial, the maximum tolerated and recommended phase II doses for HMBA administered on this schedule are 33.6 and 24 g/m2/d, respectively. However, since steady-state HMBA levels at these doses were in the range of 1 to 2 mmol/L, only approaching the lower limit demonstrated for in vitro differentiating effectiveness, and because of evidence suggesting that the exposure period is an important variable in the induction of differentiation, additional studies examining longer periods of infusion are warranted.",

Of these, 32 patients underwent surgery, while 11 patients underwent radiation alone. Before operation, 25 patients had relapsed following prior radiation, while seven others received postoperative radiation. A more aggressive surgical approach, tailored to the site of compression within the spinal canal, was used with the majority undergoing gross total tumor resection by an anterior approach. Immediate stability of the spine was achieved with methyl-methacrylate reconstruction of the resected segments. Preoperative spinal angiography with embolization of hypervascular tumors was carried out in eight patients. Patient parameters in the surgical and irradiated groups were comparable, except that a greater proportion of the radiation alone group had more than one organ system involved (64% v 44%). The median survival of the surgically treated patients was 13 months, compared with 3 months for those treated by radiation alone. In addition, a greater proportion of the surgically treated patients were benefitted neurologically (70%) compared with those treated by radiation (45%). With the development of effective surgical treatment for spinal metastases, early consideration for surgical treatment (before radiation) should be considered in selected patients. Preoperative spinal angiography and embolization are recommended whenever feasible to minimize intraoperative blood loss.",

A similar LPC has been reported in cats and monkeys. In this study, the LPC of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in the cat was used to detect impairment in attention to a relevant stimulus after low levels of cerebral concussion produced by a fluid percussion device. A hollow screw (for fluid percussion) and stainless steel screws (for AEP recording) were surgically placed in the skull. After recovery from surgery, animals were trained in the paradigm to obtain an LPC. Pupillary dilation was conditioned to tones. A random sequence of two discriminable tones was presented. The lower tone had a probability of 0.1 and was followed by a tail shock (tone-shock). After 400 to 1000 tone-shock presentations, animals attended to the lower tone stimulus as inferred by selective pupillary dilation. In the AEP an early positive component at 50 to 120 msec related to an alerting response was enhanced, and an LPC at 250 to 450 msec appeared in response to the paired tone-shock. Animals were then subjected to cerebral concussion. Complete recovery of normal reflexes, motor coordination, and orienting response was seen within 2 hours after injury. The LPC was suppressed for a period of at least 3 days, suggesting that low magnitudes of brain injury can disrupt higher-order neural activities. This disruption can persist despite recovery of other neurological functions.",

            "input": "Abstract: Tethered spinal cord, or tethered cord syndrome, describes a disorder manifested by progressive motor and sensory deficit in the legs and by incontinence. Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the elongated spinal cord is anchored by a thick filum terminale or other pathological structures. The underlying mechanism is impairment of oxidative metabolism in the lumbosacral cord. The authors studied the extensibility of various parts of lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments in experimental animals and correlated this with the oxidative metabolism in these segments. The filum terminale possesses far greater extensibility than any spinal cord segments and functions as a buffer in preventing the cord from overstretching. The lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments elongate under traction only below the attachment of the lowest pair of dentate ligaments. The lower the cord segment, the greater the percentage of elongation in spite of limited elasticity of the cord tissue; this greater percentage of elongation of the spinal cord correlates with increasing impairment of the oxidative metabolism and more severe neurological deficit. These findings explain such symptoms and signs as motor and sensory deficits in the legs associated with the human tethered cord syndrome, and correspond with the high clinical incidence of incontinence. The lower spinal cord segments elongated promptly within 3 seconds after the start of traction. This implies that repeated acute hyperextension and hyperflexion, as occurs in humans, may accentuate oxidative metabolic changes that have already been caused by chronic cord tethering. The authors conclude that the elongation of the spinal cord under traction parallels the degree of metabolic dysfunction.",

The specially designed 2-mm blunt-tipped suction/cutting probe (nucleotome) is similar to the automated vitrectomy instrumentation used by ophthalmic surgeons. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient in the prone position and with fluoroscopic guidance. The nucleotome is inserted into the appropriate disc space with specially designed instrumentation, guided by landmarks similar to those used in needle placement for chemonucleolysis. The technique has been evaluated in 20 patients with herniated discs (one at the L3-4 level and 19 at the L4-5 level) confirmed by myelography and/or computerized tomography scans after all conservative therapy for primarily radicular pain had failed. From 1 to 7 gm of disc material was removed in an average total operative time of approximately 1 hour. Eighty percent of the patients had good to excellent results in a short-term follow-up period of 6 months. Four patients subsequently required standard surgical excision of free disc fragments. No significant complications occurred. The procedure is contraindicated in patients with extruded or free fragments of disc in the spinal canal or in patients with herniations at the L5-S1 level pending development of additional instrumentation for insertion at that level. More extensive long-term studies are needed to further evaluate this procedure.",

            "input": "Abstract: The authors report the results of a long-term follow-up study of 130 patients with 161 unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. Their findings suggest that unruptured saccular aneurysms less than 10 mm in diameter have a very low probability of subsequent rupture. The mean diameter of the aneurysms that subsequently ruptured was 21.3 mm, compared with a diameter of 7.5 mm for aneurysms defined after rupture at the same institution. Part of the explanation for this discrepancy may be that the size of the filling compartment of the aneurysm decreases after rupture. There is also evidence from the present study that intracranial saccular aneurysms develop with increasing age of the patient and stabilize over a relatively short period, if they do not initially rupture, and that the likelihood of subsequent rupture decreases considerably if the initial stabilized size is less than 10 mm in diameter. Consequently, the critical size for aneurysm rupture is likely to be smaller if rupture occurs at the time of or soon after aneurysm formation. There seems to be a substantial difference in potential for growth and rupture between previously ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.",

Twenty-two had a small and 12 had a large aneurysm located on the internal carotid artery (17 cases), anterior communicating artery (10 cases), middle cerebral artery (five cases), and pericallosal artery (two cases). Fifty-two percent of patients with a minor leak from an internal carotid artery aneurysm had ipsilateral, hemicranial, hemifacial, or periorbital pain. Half of the patients initially saw a physician, but in no case was the correct diagnosis made. Twenty-five patients had a major rupture within 24 hours to 4 weeks after findings suggesting a minor leak, with a mortality rate of 53%. Nine other patients were diagnosed by lumbar puncture or computerized tomography (CT) scanning after initial misdiagnosis and were operated on, without mortality, before a major rupture could occur. The CT scans were negative in 55% of patients with a minor leak, but lumbar puncture, when performed, was always positive. A minor leak prior to major aneurysmal rupture is a common occurrence and, if unrecognized, is associated with a high mortality. Computerized tomography scanning is unreliable in diagnosing this event, and lumbar puncture is the examination of choice once intracranial hypertension has been ruled out.",

Examination for treatment selection included assessment of the circle of Willis by compression angiography and xenon blood flow studies, with the ultimate evaluation being test occlusion under systemic heparinization with the balloon temporarily placed in the desired position. Of 67 patients who underwent a formal occlusion test, eight with carotid artery aneurysms did not initially tolerate the occlusion test, and ischemic signs disappeared instantaneously with deflation and removal of the balloon. During test occlusion, two additional patients had ischemic events that proved to be embolic; these reversed immediately upon balloon deflation. Of the 65 patients in whom permanent occlusion was effected by detachable balloon, there were nine instances of delayed cerebral events. One of these was a seizure leading to respiratory arrest and resuscitation 3 days following occlusion in a patient who had presented with seizures. The other eight cases were delayed ischemic events; seven were completely reversed and one patient had residual weakness in one leg (1.5% permanent morbidity). Extracranial-intracranial bypass procedures were performed in 25 of the 65 cases. All aneurysms of the carotid artery below the level of the ophthalmic artery presented angiographic proof of complete thrombosis. Ten of 21 aneurysms arising from the supraclinoid portion of the carotid artery were completely thrombosed by proximal occlusion alone, without additional trapping procedures. Similarly, in three of six basilar trunk aneurysms, proximal occlusion alone initiated complete aneurysm thrombosis without trapping. The conclusion is that proximal balloon occlusion for unclippable cerebral aneurysms is a convenient, safe, and effective way of producing arterial occlusion in these cases.",

A large area of brain was shared between the neurologically normal infants, with defects in the scalp, skull, and dura. The twins were separated in a three-step procedure. First, areas of shared brain were divided and separated with silicone sheets. The second procedure consisted of the insertion of scalp expanders to allow primary skin closure. In the third procedure complete separation was performed which was complicated by severe hypotension in one infant that was due to dural sinus hemorrhage. Cerebrospinal fluid leak was the most difficult problem encountered in the postoperative period; this was treated with lumboperitoneal and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. After 2 years, one twin is neurologically normal; the other is severely developmentally delayed, possibly related to the severe hypotension experienced during the third procedure. A review of the literature on craniopagus is presented. Analysis of data in the literature suggests that the area involved in the craniopagus as well as the venous connections are closely related to survival following separation of craniopagus twins.",

The studies of 26 normal females and 23 normal males were subjected to bilinear interpolative background subtraction and horizontal profile analysis. Significant sexual differences were found in both regional uptake ratios and washout rates. These differences primarily reflected a proportionately decreased anterior and upper septal uptake in females, and faster washout in females. Faster myocardial 201Tl washout rates in females could not be clearly ascribed to either a physiological or artifactual explanation. It is concluded that since important differences exist between males and females in the detected pattern of 201Tl myocardial uptake and washout, sex-specific criteria may enhance the predictive accuracy of exercise-redistribution 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy.",

Three hundred twelve leukocyte scans on 271 patients were retrospectively reviewed and classified as positive or negative, and as to whether or not they were being treated with antibiotics at the time the leukocyte scan was performed. The overall sensitivity, considering all 312 studies, was 90%. One hundred sixty-nine patient studies were on patients receiving antibiotics; 143 studies were on patients not on antibiotics. The sensitivity of the leukocyte scan was 88.7% in patients on antibiotic therapy; it was 92.1% in those who were not receiving antibiotics. The differences in sensitivity between the two groups were not significantly different (p less than 0.05).

Iodination and separation of bound and free iodide, using AG1-X8 ion exchange resin, are both accomplished in this vial. We found 90 +/- 4% of the iodide which was added was incorporated, respectively, into each of four different monoclonal antibodies evaluated. Approximately 90% of labeled antibody was recovered in each case. The monoclonal antibody OC125 was labeled to specific activities up to 25 mCi/mg. Immunoreactivities of 82 +/- 2% using 125I and 66 +/- 5% using 131I were achieved. As the radioiodination is done in one sealed vial and takes less than 15 min, this procedure is safe and can be performed in any nuclear medicine laboratory. The final product, which is sterile and apyrogenic, is suitable for diagnostic and radiotherapeutic applications.",

In addition, PDFR was tested as a potential index of the severity of disease. Good agreement in PDFR was found between NCP and contrast ventriculography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001), but there was poor correlation between RNA and contrast ventriculography. Ejection fraction measured by either RNA or NCP correlated well with contrast ventriculography (r = 0.96 and r = 0.73, respectively). A positive correlation was found between PDFR and the EF measured by the NCP (r = 0.79) and by contrast ventriculography (r = 0.64), but poor correlation was found between these parameters by RNA. Patients with multivessel CAD had lower PDFR than patients with single vessel disease when studied by the NCP (1.6 +/- 0.4 versus 2.5 versus 0.6 EDV/sec [mean +/- s.d.], p less than 0.0001), but not by RNA. Thus, compared with contrast ventriculography, determination of PDFR is more accurate by NCP than by RNA. Furthermore, the PDFR measured by NCP, but not by RNA, may be a potentially useful index of the extent of CAD.",

At baseline, antithrombin III activity and factor VII levels were reduced in all three patients; antithrombin III protein and protein C antigen were also slightly lowered in one patient, and factor X in another. beta-Thromboglobulin, a measure of platelet activation, was increased in one case. During pyridoxine treatment, antithrombin III activity was rapidly restored to normal; factor VII increased and beta-thromboglobulin decreased. These data suggest that, in addition to platelet activation, abnormalities of blood clotting, and particularly reduction of antithrombin III, may play a role in the thrombotic tendency associated with homocystinuria. The nature of these clotting alterations is still uncertain, but their improvement during active metabolic treatment suggests that the defect in amino acid transsulfuration of homocystinuria may directly affect synthesis or activity of some liver-dependent clotting factors.",

Compared with a group of age- and size-matched controls, the infants with BPD had a significantly (P less than 0.005) lower functional residual capacity (FRC; 25 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 6 ml/kg) at less than 10 1/2 months after conception, but no significant difference during the remainder of the first year. The partial expiratory flow volume curves in the infants with BPD were markedly concave, with tidal breathing approaching expiratory flow limitation. The infants with BPD had significantly (P less than 0.01) lower absolute and size-corrected flows than did control infants, and 50% of the infants with BPD required rehospitalization because of acute respiratory distress associated with a lower respiratory tract illness. In addition, the slope of the linear regression of maximal expiratory flow at FRC (in milliliters per second) vs length (in centimeters) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) for the infants with BPD than for normal control infants (2.25 vs 4.52), indicating poor growth of the airways. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 was negatively correlated with maximal expiratory flow at FRC, indicating that measurement of SaO2 alone may not be sufficient in the evaluation of lung function in infants with BPD. We conclude that, although infants with BPD improve clinically during the first year of life, they have abnormal functional airway growth; the decreased expiratory flow reserve helps to explain their high risk for acute respiratory distress during lower respiratory tract illness.",

In five of eight term neonates and in all premature infants, a potentially significant limitation of neutrophil production was detected. Unlike the slowly proliferating CFU-GM present in the blood of healthy adult subjects (7% thymidine suicide, range 0% to 32%), the circulating CFU-GM in the premature subjects were proliferating at a near maximal rate (55%, range 40% to 75%, P less than 0.001). Because CFU-GM proliferation is nearly maximal in the baseline, noninfected state, neonates may have restricted ability to increase neutrophil production from CFU-GM during times of increased neutrophil need, such as during bacterial infection. Such inability may predispose neonates to exhaustion of the neutrophil supply during bacterial infection.",

We compared pulse oximeter SaO2 with simultaneously measured SaO2 (range 78% to 100%) using a co-oximeter. Over a wide range of values for heart rate, blood pressure, hematocrit, PO2, PCO2, and pH, linear regression analysis revealed a close correlation between in vivo pulse oximeter readings and in vitro SaO2 measurements in patients with acute (r = 0.86, Y = 29.64 + 0.68X) and chronic (r = 0.91, Y = 6.29 + 0.96X) disease. Regression analysis of tcPO2 versus PaO2 showed an r value of 0.76 in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In these patients the mean difference between pulse oximeter SaO2 and in vitro SaO2 was 2.9% +/- 1.8% (SD), whereas the mean difference between tcPO2 and PaO2 was -14.5 +/- 11.1 mm Hg. Fetal hemoglobin ranged from 4.3% to 95%.

Six to 17 months later, 45 (90%) of the patient's parents were interviewed to assess compliance and treatment outcome. Children who significantly improved had a more internal locus of control (P less than 0.05) and better compliance (P less than 0.05) as determined by two separate outcome variables. Locus of control and compliance were not, however, significantly correlated with each other; each appeared to have an independent association with outcome. There was no association between perceived self-competence and outcome. The positive association between locus of control and outcome was not mediated by socioeconomic status, age, duration of encopresis, severity of encopresis, gender, or time between initiation of treatment and follow-up.

Between May 1975 and May 1985, the NWRSP screened 850,431 infants, detecting 192 infants with primary hypothyroidism (1:4429) and eight with hypopituitary hypothyroidism (1:106,304). In 11 additional infants, TSH deficiency, not detected by the screening program, was diagnosed on recognition of clinical features over the same period. Thyroid hormone treatment was begun in seven of the 11 infants prior to obtaining the screening sample results because of clinical symptoms of hypopituitarism, including hypoglycemia, persistent jaundice, microgenitalia, diabetes insipidus, midface hypoplasia, cleft lip or palate, or abnormalities of vision. The other four infants were not detected despite clinical features of hypopituitarism (in retrospect) and low serum T4 with TSH concentration below assay sensitivity on at least one screening sample. The most accurate assessment of total cases comes from Oregon, where all cases of congenital hypopituitarism are referred to our center; we estimate a frequency of 1:29,000. In our experience, a combination of newborn T4-supplemental TSH screening measurements and recognition of clinical features of hypopituitarism is the optimal strategy for detecting infants with congenital hypopituitary hypothyroidism.",

Immunologic studies included lymphocyte markers, in vitro responses to mitogens and antigens with corresponding skin tests, and antibody response with isoagglutinins, post-vaccination antibodies, and Candida. A serologic profile of antibody to GP110, P18, and P25 LAV/HTLV III antigens by radioimmunoprecipitation assay was also performed. The antigen-induced proliferative responses were normal in 10 patients who had a stable course, but were profoundly impaired in eight others who died or had poor condition with opportunistic infections. These in vitro measurements were well correlated with antigen skin tests. An abnormal antibody response to antigens, a low level of isoagglutinins, and a peculiar profile of LAV/HTLV III antibodies were also frequently observed in these eight patients. These measurements appear to be of prognostic value because they were noticed soon after onset of clinical symptoms.",

Proved bacterial infections were identified in 24 patients, four of whom had bacteremia. M. hominis and U. urealyticum were not isolated from any of the 191 blood and 199 CSF specimens tested. Of 170 specimens of urine cultured for Mycoplasma, M. hominis was isolated in six patients, U. urealyticum in nine patients, and both organisms in one patient. Twelve of the positive cultures were voided urine specimens, and four were suprapubic bladder aspiration specimens. Genital mycoplasmas appear to be uncommon causes of sepsis or meningitis in young infants. Further studies are required to assess their role in abnormal conditions of the urinary tract in childhood.",

Skull fractures in one patient were visualized by CT alone. MRI alone demonstrated posterior fossa bleeding in one patient and intraparenchymal bleeding in another; an additional patient in whom CT showed relatively diffuse atrophy also had defined areas of focal atrophy apparent on MRI. Subarachnoid hemorrhages were equally well detected using CT or MRI. Overall, MRI was superior to CT for detection of intracranial injury caused by shaking, and may help to document milder instances of this form of child abuse.",

Past history and positive findings in the sexual partners of some of the patients suggested long-standing herpesvirus activity in the lower genital tract.

Major findings of the survey show that 97 percent of the writers allocated more space for clinical evaluations than basic science evaluations. Less than 50 percent of the writers included the student's class rank. Almost all included narrative evaluations of the student's performance during the clinical years. Negative information on students was addressed inconsistently by the writers.

Psychologists and social workers as a group were the primary mental health teachers in family medicine residencies. Traditional internal medicine programs emphasized psychophysiological reactions and simple pharmacotherapy, while primary care internal medicine and family practice programs concentrated on life cycle issues, psychosocial awareness, and simple psychosocial management techniques. None of the three types of residencies focused on complex psychiatric disorders or management techniques. The three specialties differed significantly (F = 13, p = .0001) in the total amount of time on average the resident spent in formal mental health instruction.

Residents of various specialties attended a mandatory short course on clinical teaching skills in the middle of their first year of postgraduate medical training. Three types of evaluation data were collected at three times during a two-year period: self-ratings by the residents, questionnaires completed by the residents, and ratings completed by students taught by the residents. Complete data for 18 residents indicated that the residents rated their teaching skills significantly higher after the course (at the end of both the first year and the second year) than before it. At the end of the second year, 94 percent of the residents stated that the course was helpful, 67 percent could recall and explain specific principles of teaching, and 61 percent reported using principles from the course in their teaching. Students' ratings of these 18 residents were too scanty to be interpreted validly. The study suggests that residents of varying specialties can profit from an introductory course on teaching skills and that the effects endure for at least one and a half years.",

            "input": "Abstract: The responses of key liver carbohydrate intermediates to severe hemorrhage were investigated in fed and fasted young adult male rats. Forty per cent of intravascular blood was withdrawn and liver was sampled by freeze-clamp at 0, 0.25, 1.0, 3.0, and 4.0-5.0 hours. Fed rats with abundant glycogen showed a threefold increase in glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) concentration, and fasted rats showed a 75% decline in G6P immediately after hemorrhage. This significant difference in response traces to the fact that G6P is one of the first catabolites in fed liver formed by glycogenolysis but is the last intermediate of the gluconeogenic pathway in fasted animals. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the high-energy intermediate, was markedly depleted in both fed and fasted rats at zero time. In the fasted animal, however, the PEP was rapidly restored, and by 1.0 hour was threefold above normal. The ability of fasted rats to rapidly synthesize glucose from accumulated lactate is attributed to increased amount of gluconeogenic enzymes induced by fasting. In prolonged shock states, this synthetic capacity plays a protective role. Contrariwise, in brief shock states such as hemorrhage, the immediate availability of glucose from stored glycogen appears to be a more important determinant of survival. In the present experiments, fed rats were more resistant to the hemorrhage protocol.",

The procedure is compared to the standard dissection tracheostomy method of Chevalier Jackson. This procedure has several advantages over the standard dissection method, the most significant of which appears to be the speed with which it can be performed. It can be done in 30 seconds, as opposed to the dissection procedure which requires 3 minutes or more for a surgeon to complete it. Autopsies on 14 of these patients are discussed. Long-term followup, that is for 1 year and more, is reported in 19 cases. Advantages of the percutaneous technique over the standard dissection technique are detailed.",

The presence of one or more abnormal signs identified a group of seriously injured trauma patients (mean Injury Severity Score = 29.1) with 24% mortality compared to a predicted mortality of 32% (p less than 0.02). Unresponsiveness to verbal stimulation in the field was the single most predictive criterion, yielding sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 85%.

After exclusion of 39 patients with early deaths (19 dead on arrival, nine died in emergency room, and 11 died in operating room), the 196 remaining patients were treated in accordance with an evolving selective management program. Definitive management included splenectomy in 117 patients (59.7%), repair in 32 (16.3%), and nonoperative treatment in 47 (24%). A spectrum of blunt splenic trauma, as manifested by the degree of associated injuries (Injury Severity Scores), hemodynamic status, and blood transfusion requirements, was identified and permitted application of a rational selective management program that proved safe and effective for all age groups. Comparative analysis of the three methods of treatment demonstrated differences that were more a reflection of the overall magnitude of total bodily injury sustained rather than the specific manner in which any injured spleen was managed. Retrospective analysis of 19 nonoperative management failures enabled establishment of the following selection criteria for nonoperative management: absolute hemodynamic stability; minimal or lack of peritoneal findings; and maximal transfusion requirement of 2 units for the splenic injury. With operative management, splenorrhaphy is preferred, but it was often precluded by associated life-threatening injuries or by technical limitations. Of 42 attempted splenic repairs, ten (24%) were abandoned intraoperatively. There were no late failures of repair. In many cases of blunt splenic trauma, splenectomy still remains the most appropriate course of action.",

Nitrogen excretion was found to remain relatively stable or to rise in response to protein intake over a wide range of nonprotein calorie intakes. Urine urea nitrogen excretion was not related to caloric intake, but was correlated (p less than 0.04) with nitrogen intake. In this study protein conservation was not achieved by increasing caloric intake up to and beyond two times the basal energy expenditure in the brain-injured patient. In these patients nitrogen balance could only be achieved by nitrogen intakes in excess of the high protein catabolic rate.

To elucidate this issue, we reviewed 538 consecutive patients admitted with acute pelvic fracture during a 5-year period. Injury mechanism was motor vehicular in 214 (40%), falls in 152 (28%), auto-pedestrian in 92 (17%), motorcycle in 46 (9%), crush in 26 (5%), and assault or skiing in eight (1%). Ninety-two (17%) of these patients required greater than 6 units of blood transfusion during the first postinjury day, and are the primary focus of this report. Twenty-five patients (28%) had unilateral anterior (Group I, n = 20) or posterior (Group II, n = 5) fractures. The remaining 67 patients (72%) had anterior and posterior element involvement on the same side (Group II, n = 38), bilaterally (Group IV, n = 14), or open perineal wounds (Group V, n = 15). The PASG was applied in 47 patients (51%), and controlled hemorrhage in 12 (71%) of the 17 in whom it was used alone to tamponade pelvic bleeding. Peritoneal lavage was performed in 73 patients (79%). Initial aspirate yielded gross blood in 32 patients; 27 (84%) of these required urgent laparotomy. External skeletal fixation was applied in 19 patients; bleeding was controlled in 18 (95%). Pelvic angiography identified active hemorrhage in three patients and selective embolization was successful in two. Sixty-eight (74%) of the high-risk patients survived. Thirteen (54%) of the 24 deaths were attributable to the pelvic trauma, ten were due to recalcitrant bleeding, and three to delayed sepsis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There were 114 males and 30 females with a mean age of 28.6 years. The total time of followup was 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months). Indications for splenectomy were blunt trauma, 111 patients; penetrating trauma, six patients; and intra-operative injury, 27 patients. During the followup to date, 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization have occurred in 13 patients (9%). Fulminant pneumococcal sepsis resulted in the death of a 27-year-old male, 3 years after splenectomy. Septicemia occurred in four patients, pneumonia in five, abscess in two, infection of a prosthetic heart valve in one, meningitis in one, and fever of unknown origin in one. All but two of these infections were due to encapsulated organisms. Minor septic complications occurred in 44 patients (30%), and consisted of infections which required outpatient medical care. Major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (18.5% and 5.9% respectively; p less than 0.05). The mortality from major septic complications in this series (7%) is lower than previously reported by other investigators (30-80%). Our data suggest that adults undergoing splenectomy for trauma are at an increased risk of developing late major septic complications. This risk is significant enough to warrant attempts at splenic salvage, especially when injury is incidental to an elective operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In all but one case, this analysis scheme successfully prioritized toxicants for subsequent analysis. Despite its limitations, the scheme is a substantial improvement over other available methods.",

Several techniques are available for use, and selection of the most appropriate method can be tailored to the specific anatomy being managed. Our total experience included 27 kidneys that have been managed by ex vivo renal artery reconstruction. Lesions managed in this manner include two kidneys with renal artery stenosis and renal tumors, one kidney with a congenital branch arteriovenous malformation, and 24 kidneys with branch occlusive or aneurysmal disease from fibromuscular dysplasia. Postoperative angiography was performed in 22 cases and defined successful revascularization without technical error in 20 cases. One operative death occurred as a result of myocardial infarction. One patient required reoperation to control bleeding, and two patients had temporary acute tubular necrosis during the postoperative period. Techniques employed included ex vivo repair with autotransplantation to the iliac system (six kidneys), mobilization and perfusion without transection of the renal vein (10 kidneys), and ex vivo perfusion and repair with replacement into the original renal fossa (11 kidneys). The authors believe this latter technique of reconstruction to be preferable to autotransplantation for the usual patient undergoing ex vivo repair of complex renovascular lesions.",

Injured were the inferior vena cava, iliac, femoral, popliteal, distal leg, and arm veins; all patients underwent surgical exploration. Arterial injuries were repaired by standard techniques and venous injuries were either ligated or repaired by end-to-end or lateral phleborrhaphy. Adjunctive fasciotomy was used when clinically indicated. The patients were followed up for 1 month to 9 years. No permanent sequelae of venous ligation were identified. Transient extremity edema developed in up to 32% of patients, regardless of whether vein ligation or repair was performed. This edema resolved completely within 12 weeks of the injury. No extremity was lost after ligation of a venous injury. Although it may be ideal to repair all venous vascular injuries, selective management reflecting mechanism of injury, blood loss, anesthesia requirements, associated organ injury, and other concerns may mitigate against extensive venous repair.",

Eighteen patients referred for evaluation of asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques had a 50% incidence of ipsilateral carotid bifurcation disease, but only 16% of these were considered surgically remediable; five of these patients eventually required carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Nine of the 18 patients with asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques were further evaluated with serial ocular fundus photography: the plaque persisted in all nine patients--in four for more than 6 months and in five for more than 1 year. No patient had transient or fixed retinal or cerebral symptoms. Twenty-six patients with amaurosis fugax showed a 70% incidence of significant bifurcation disease and three had significant intracranial disease; 50% eventually required CEA. Twelve patients with fixed visual deficits (four patients had homonymous hemianopsia, four had retinal artery occlusions, and four had ischemic retinopathies) demonstrated a 100% incidence of bifurcation disease, but in addition 85% had significant intracranial disease; only one of this group had surgically amenable disease. Amaurosis fugax preceded blindness in two patients. Hollenhorst plaque as an isolated phenomenon appears to be a retinal embolic event of uncertain age, with poor predictive power for further embolic events, and not as highly correlated with significant or surgically amenabe carotid bifurcation disease.",

Phlebography or noninvasive studies documented deep vein thrombosis and blood cultures were positive in all patients. The mean age was 31.5 years with a male/female ratio of 5:2. All patients were treated with anticoagulants and intravenous antibiotics. One patient required surgical exploration for associated abscess of the groin. The patients became afebrile with normal white blood cell counts from 3 to 18 days after therapy was begun. No cases of recurrent sepsis occurred.

Seven patients have been lost to follow-up but none is recorded as dead (National Registry of Deaths) at least 5 years after operation. Fifteen patients (16.5%) have died, four from cerebral and eight from cardiac causes. Three patients had cerebral infarction with permanent deficits, one occurring immediately after operation, one at 3 months, and one at 9 years. Four patients had minor strokes but a full clinical recovery, three patients postoperatively and one patient at 4 years. Fourteen patients had ipsilateral TIAs, four occurred postoperatively and 10 occurred from 1 to 8 years later. Ten patients had contralateral TIAs and five patients then had a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Another nine patients also had bilateral operations, three for bilateral TIAs, five as prophylactic procedures on the basis of arteriographic findings, and one for a contralateral cerebral event that occurred after arteriography. Thus, at the mean follow-up time (5.5 years) and including the operative complications, four deaths (4%) of cerebral origin and seven serious cerebral problems (7%) have occurred--an annual morbidity and mortality rate of less than 2%. This compares favorably with the commonly predicted rate of stroke occurring after TIAs of 5% per year. These figures support the argument that carotid endarterectomy reduces the incidence of stroke occurring after TIA and stops TIAs caused by emboli from the carotid bifurcation.",

Diagnosis was suspected on the basis of positive blood and catheter tip cultures, indium-labeled leukocyte scan, and bilateral upper extremity phlebograms. Venous thrombectomy with a Fogarty catheter of the upper extremity central veins was performed after a superior vena cava Greenfield filter had been placed to prevent pulmonary embolism. The thrombus culture was positive for Candida albicans, and the reestablishment of vein patency in conjunction with amphotericin B therapy resulted in cure. This technique allows a definitive diagnosis of septic central thrombosis to be made and reestablishment of vein patency may also enhance antibiotic therapy.",

Our pulmonary medicine service originally evaluated an elderly woman with a right pleural effusion and upper lobe infiltrate thought to be tuberculosis. An abdominal CT scan performed at that time showed extensive periaortic adenopathy. Isoniazid and rifampin were started, but both were stopped by the patient after less than 6 months of therapy. The patient later had night sweats, a left pleural effusion, and a tender abdominal mass thought to be a symptomatic aneurysm. At operation, the aorta was necrotic and had an inflammatory mass and perforation on the left side. Infrarenal aortic ligation and resection were performed to control infection. A previously placed axillofemoral graft obviated the need for concomitant revascularization. The patient was treated postoperatively with isoniazid and rifampin until hyperbilirubinemia developed, which necessitated alternate therapy with ethambutol and streptomycin. The patient died one month after operation of a presumed pulmonary embolus.",

After four weeks of therapy the 11 cyclosporine recipients had the following response to treatment: two had total clearing and six improved markedly, two moderately, and one minimally; whereas ten vehicle-treated patients showed no change or minimal improvement. Vehicle-treated patients, after a switch to cyclosporine for four weeks, demonstrated impressive improvement similar to that seen in patients who initially received only cyclosporine. Moderate or marked improvement or total clearing was noted in 17 (81%) of 21 and 20 (95%) of 21 after one and four weeks of therapy, respectively. Mitotic figures and leukotriene B4 levels in lesions decreased 86% and 64%, respectively, after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. Mononuclear (including activated T cells) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates were markedly reduced in lesions of all patients after seven days of cyclosporine therapy. These results suggest that psoriasis may have an immunologic basis mediated by activated T cells and/or other immune cells; if a long-term regimen with a favorable efficacy-side effect ratio can be determined, cyclosporine would be a significant advance in the treatment of psoriasis.",

Specific occupational exposures that could be implicated as the source of human immunodeficiency virus infection were not identified for any health care workers with AIDS.

The three diets provided, respectively, 21% of the energy as fructose, 23% of the energy as sucrose, and almost all carbohydrate energy as starch. The fructose diet resulted in significantly lower one- and two-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels, overall mean plasma glucose levels, and urinary glucose excretion in both type I and type II subjects than did the starch diet. There were no significant differences between the sucrose and starch diets in any of the measures of glycemic control in either subject group. The fructose and sucrose diets did not significantly increase serum triglyceride values when compared with the starch diet, but both increased postprandial serum lactate levels. We conclude that short-term replacement of other carbohydrate sources in the diabetic diet with fructose will improve glycemic control, whereas replacement with sucrose will not aggravate glycemic control.",

This report suggests that an exaggerated allergic response should be considered in the pathogenesis of pansinusitis. The presence of fungal hyphae in sinus mucosal specimens should alert the physician to the possibility of this disease.

In a prior study, we found that although imipramine had no effect on ejection fraction as measured by first-pass radionuclide angiography, the treatment could not be tolerated by 50% of the patients because of intolerable drug-induced orthostatic hypotension. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is an effective antidepressant that, in depressed patients without heart disease, causes significantly less orthostatic hypotension than imipramine. To see if this advantage could be safely extended to patients with congestive failure, we measured the effect of nortriptyline on ejection fraction and blood pressure in 21 depressed patients with left ventricular impairment. Ejection fraction was unchanged by nortriptyline treatment, and orthostatic hypotension developed in only one (5%) of 21 patients. Nortriptyline emerges as a relatively safe treatment for depression in patients with left ventricular impairment.",

There were 358 reactions occurring in 347 patients, for an overall reaction rate among patients of 2.2%. Each patient received a mean of eight different drugs. Rashes were attributed to 51 drugs, and 75% of the allergic cutaneous reactions were attributed to antibiotics, blood products, and inhaled mucolytics. Amoxicillin (51.4 reactions per 1000 patients exposed), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33.8/1000), and ampicillin (33.2/1000) had the highest reaction rates. Drug-specific reaction rates ranged from zero to 51.4 per 1000 and were determined for 180 drugs or drug groups. These results provide physicians with quantitative data that will be helpful in clinical decision making when drug-induced exanthems, urticaria, or generalized pruritus occurs.",

The unfavorable natural history of respiratory failure in this group of patients has been suggested as a causative factor. We analyzed the outcome of 46 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer on whom mechanical ventilators were utilized. Although seven patients were ultimately weaned and survived for at least 24 hours, three of them subsequently died prior to discharge from the hospital. The remaining 39 patients died while using the ventilator. Patient age, tumor cell type, and the etiology of respiratory failure were not significantly different between the weaned and unweaned populations. A difference was noted in the duration of mechanical ventilation: none of the patients who could be weaned required mechanical ventilation for more than six days (range, two to six days). Respiratory failure in the nonsurgical lung cancer patient carries a poor prognosis, and selection of patients for mechanical ventilation should be conservative.",

Each had been interviewed by the same Admissions Committee, which earlier had selected 150 students through the traditional process. In contrasting the initially accepted and initially rejected groups, academic and demographic variables accounted for only 28% of group difference. The 72% of group difference not accounted for by the variables examined was presumed to relate to Admissions Committee preference. In attrition and in both preclinical and clinical performance through medical school and one year of postgraduate training, there were no meaningful differences between the groups. The observations suggest that the traditional interview process probably does not enhance the ability to predict performance of medical school applicants.",

This underscores the utility of this test in confirming the diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria. Measurement of enzyme activity in 41 families with acute intermittent porphyria demonstrated that deficient activity is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Many latent carriers of the genetic defect were identified by family studies, permitting appropriate precautions to avoid potentially lethal porphyric attacks.",

A muscle biopsy specimen showed a vacuolar myopathy, and markedly decreased muscle carnitine content and carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity. Following recovery, muscle carnitine content was normal but carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was still abnormally low. The ratio of palmitoyl-coenzyme A plus carnitine to palmitoylcarnitine oxidation by muscle mitochondria isolated from the patient was markedly decreased. We conclude that transiently decreased muscle carnitine content interacted with partial deficiency of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-A to produce rhabdomyolysis and respiratory failure and that ibuprofen may have precipitated the clinical event.",

Most (93%) of the rats on the high protein diet died within three days following renal ischemia. In addition, 69% of the rats on normal protein diets also died, most before the fourth day following ischemic insult. In contrast, 88% of the rats on the low protein diet lived, although some exhibited elevated serum creatinine levels for up to one to two weeks following ischemia. Finally, all of the rats on no protein diets lived, and most (75%) exhibited normal serum creatinine levels by the fourth day following ischemia. Shifting the diets of high protein and normal protein adapted rats to no protein diets immediately following ischemia did not improve postischemic survival. Also, changing the diets of no protein adapted rats to high protein diets immediately following ischemia did not significantly affect postischemic recovery. When rats were maintained on no protein diets for shorter periods of time prior to ischemia, it was found that approximately a week on this diet is necessary to provide maximum protection from postischemic acute renal failure. These findings demonstrate a dramatic effect of dietary protein prior to ischemic induced acute renal failure, and suggests that preoperative dietary protein intake should be an important consideration in those situations which are predisposed to postoperative acute renal failure.",

To clarify the nature of glutamine (substrate of ammonia production) transport in PST, both luminal resorption and peritubular uptake of glutamine were measured in isolated rabbit PST. Luminal glutamine resorption (Jgln) was measured at various perfusate glutamine concentration (0.05 to 20 mM) at 38 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Jgln measured at 12 degrees C were proportional to mean luminal glutamine concentrations. This flux was thought to be a passive glutamine flux. The flux, which was obtained by subtracting passive glutamine flux from Jgln obtained at 38 degrees C, was thought to be active luminal resorption. This flux exhibited saturation kinetics (Vmax 20.9 pmol min-1 X mm-1, km 5.2 mM). When bath pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8, Jgln showed no change or a small decrease (12%) at perfusate glutamine concentrations of 0.05 or 5 mM, respectively. When perfusate pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8 Jgln showed a small decrease (10%) at 5 mM perfusate glutamine concentration. Peritubular glutamine uptake was determined in isolated nonperfused PST incubated for 5 to 50 min in [14C]-glutamine containing solution. When incubated in pH 7.4 HCO3 buffer solution, cell to medium 14C concentration ratio was higher than unity (3.83 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.001) at 5 min, and reached a maximum (11.37 +/- 1.13) at 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In animals which suffered no change in these metabolites during hypotension, retransfusion immediately restored normal renal function. When metabolite changes were observed during hypotension, they occurred suddenly with severe ATP depletion, Pi accumulation, and intracellular acidosis occurring almost concurrently. Metabolic changes of this magnitude were always associated with renal dysfunction in the post-hypotensive period, which occurred even when the period of biochemical change was only 10 to 15 minutes. The abnormalities in post-hypotensive renal function resemble the pattern of change seen in human acute tubular necrosis (ATN): depressed glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine output varying from polyuria to oliguria, decreased urine to plasma inulin ratio, increased urinary sodium concentration, increased fractional excretion of sodium, and increased fractional excretion of potassium. It is postulated that changes in renal cellular energy status during hemorrhagic hypotension distinguish pre-renal failure from early or incipient ATN.",

Efferent arterioles near the glomeruli also dilated to dopamine but the dilation was less than that of the preglomerular vessels. Higher dopamine concentrations (3 X 10(-4) and 1 X 10(-3) M) produced more variable effects, with a tendency for the arcuate and interlobular arteries and the afferent and efferent arterioles away from the glomeruli to decrease in diameter. After pretreatment with haloperidol, dopamine (1 X 10(-6) to 1 X 10(-4) M) did not dilate any pre- or postglomerular vascular segment, but the tendency for pre- and postglomerular constrictions with higher dopamine concentrations were not abolished. Pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol enhanced the dilator response of the pre- and postglomerular vessels (except the afferent arterioles near glomeruli and efferent arterioles near welling points) to dopamine (3 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M), and abolished the reductions in diameter produced by the high dopamine levels. These data indicate that the dilator effect of dopamine is mediated by interactions with specific dopaminergic receptors, while alpha and beta adrenergic receptors appear to mediate a constrictor influence observed with high dopamine concentrations. The overall effect of dopamine on the renal vessel diameters thus appears to depend on the balance of dilator and constrictor stimuli mediated by multiple receptors.",

Twelve patients underwent bone biopsy immediately prior to and after one year of such treatment. Those with larger quantities of non-mineralized bone matrix (osteoid) experienced a reduction in relative osteoid volume, mean osteoid seam width, and total osteoid surface. Moreover, the use of time-spaced kinetic markers of mineralization (tetracycline) enabled us to demonstrate that CAPD usually decreased the amount of non-mineralized bone matrix by shortening mineralization lag time (that is, the interval from organic matrix deposition to its mineralization). The changes in the histomorphology appeared to occur independently of bone aluminum. These data indicate that CAPD generally enhances the mineralizing capacity of individual osteoblasts and suggests that such therapy is beneficial to the uremic skeleton.",

Unknown solute(s) retained in renal failure have been extracted from uremic fluids. When added to normal plasma they induce a similar binding defect. Similar activity can be extracted from normal urine. We have devised a series of extraction and purification techniques that yielded three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine in sufficient quantity and of a high degree of purity. Rigorous methods have been applied to determine chemical identity of the ligands. Purification steps consisted of: adsorption at pH 3.0 to polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2); elution from the resin with methanol followed by drying and solution in dilute formic acid; passage through SP-Sephadex to remove cations, especially yellow-brown pigments; adsorption to the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex, and separation into three zones of inhibitory activity with a formic acid gradient; purification to homogeneity with C-8 or C-18 silica reversed-phase chromatography. Using this isolation procedure, followed by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have shown that the binding inhibitory activity is due not to one ligand, but to a family of aromatic acids. To date hippurate, beta-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-hydracrylate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate have been identified as binding inhibitors. Other active ligands remain to be identified.",

Group 1 patients (N = 7) all excreted less than 40% of the water load during immersion, whereas excretion was greater than 40% in all eight patients in Group 2. Group 1 patients, when compared with Group 2, had more ascites, more diuretic resistance, lower serum sodium concentration (125 +/- 2 vs. 130 +/- 1 mEq/liter, P less than 0.05), and more impaired baseline water excretion (12.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 35.9 +/- 5.9% of water load in 5 hr, P less than 0.005). Systemic hemodynamic responses to water immersion were similar in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were significantly more impaired in Group 1 patients (inulin clearance 28 +/- 6 vs. 62 +/- 9 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.05; para-aminohippurate clearance 212 +/- 35 vs. 357 +/- 37 ml/min, P less than 0.05).

Urinary pH increased from low (5.30 +/- 0.31 SD) to normal (6.19 to 6.46) during treatment. Urinary content of undissociated uric acid, which was high to begin with at 204 +/- 82 mg/day, decreased to the normal range (64 to 108 mg/day) following treatment. Urinary citrate rose from 503 +/- 225 mg/day to 852 to 998 mg/day. Urinary saturation of calcium oxalate significantly declined with potassium citrate treatment. New stone formation rate declined from 1.20 +/- 1.68 stones/year to 0.01 +/- 0.04 stones/year (P less than 0.001 by chi square). Remission was experienced in 94.4% of patients, and the group stone formation rate declined by 99.2%. Detailed case reports were obtained in five patients showing different responses between sodium alkali and potassium alkali treatment. All five patients had persistently low urinary pH (typically less than 5.5) and normouricosuria, and four had hyperuricemia. Before treatment, they had stones surgically removed or spontaneously passed, which were pure uric acid in composition. When sodium alkali was give (as bicarbonate or citrate, 60 to 118 mEq/day), new stone formation continued in four patients, and a radiolucent (uric acid) calculus become \"calcified\" in the remaining patient.

We utilized an accelerated unilateral model of adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis characterized by morphological changes more severe than in the classical model. The first events in ADR-induced glomerulopathy were epithelial cell damage and proteinuria. Subsequently, tubular casts were formed at the distal level. The cast formation preceded the development of interstitial damage, which was determined by tubular obstruction and breaking of tubular basement membrane (TBM), which in turn promoted an interstitial inflammatory reaction. Despite the severity of tubulo-interstitial damage observed after a long period of heavy proteinuria, the incidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSG) was very low. The results of the present study indicate that chronic proteinuria is not necessarily accompanied by the development of focal sclerosis. Tubulo-interstitial lesions appear to be the most important determinant for the progression of renal damage in this model.",

            "input": "Abstract: Calcium absorption in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has been reported to be increased, decreased or not different from their normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKy) control. One postulated reason for these conflicting results is an abnormal sensitivity to the intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D3). Previous studies in everted duodenal sacs and perfused duodenum examined the acute response to 1,25D3 only in 12-week-old SHR, which however already had higher basal rates of calcium absorption. Inability to stimulate Ca absorption further was an unexcluded possibility. To test this hypothesis more vigorously, balance and in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake studies were performed in SHR and WKy using four separate protocols yielding the following results. First, in response to pharmacological doses of 1,25D3 (25 ng/100 g body wt/day X 3), four-week-old normotensive female SHR had higher net calcium absorption (41.4 vs. 31.1 mg/day; 61.6 vs. 48.1%), similar to the increases seen in the untreated state. These results suggest intrinsic epithelial differences independent of 1,25D3. Ca absorption was similarly higher in 1,25D3 treated male SHR (42.9 vs. 36.7 mg/day; 60.1 vs. 53.7%). Second, at 12 to 14 weeks of age, low doses of 1,25D3 (8 ng/100 g body wt/day X 6) stimulated net Ca absorption in the female SHR (33.0 to 39.1 mg/day), but not in WKy (26.8 to 29.3 mg/day). In the male, positive effects were again seen only in the SHR (25 to 45 mg/day). Third, in response to three weeks of dietary Ca deprivation, in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake, measured in the conscious awake state, was higher in 35-week-old SHR (70.9 vs. 53.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the first group of seven studies, AII in a mean dose of 12.7 ng/kg/min was administered i.v. to water loaded dogs. The infusion induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP, 99 to 118 mm Hg, P less than 0.001), and significant reductions in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 67 to 57 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and para-aminohippurate clearance (CPAH, 280 to 212 ml/min, P less than 0.005) occurred. Despite this decrement in renal hemodynamics, urine remained maximally dilute (Uosm, 58 to 61 mOsm/kg H2O, NS). Furthermore, plasma ADH was suppressed maximally after water load and did not increase after i.v. AII infusion. The IC infusion of AII (mean dose 5.8 ng/kg/min) produced similar changes in hemodynamics; plasma ADH remained undetectable. When AII was administered i.v. to hydropenic animals (mean dose 8.3 ng/kg/min), MAP again increased (86 to 111 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) as GFR (81.3 to 68.6 ml/min, NS) and CPAH (291 to 223 ml/min, P less than 0.05) declined modestly. In these animals, Uosm decreased significantly (1429 to 1114 mOsm/kg H2O, P less than 0.005) and plasma ADH did not change significantly (1.66 to 1.88 pg/ml, NS). When IC AII (4 ng/kg/min) was repeated in hydropenic dogs pretreated with indomethacin, neither Usom (1787 to 1664 mOsm/kg H2O, NS) nor plasma ADH were altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Control rats with two kidneys were compared with unilaterally nephrectomized rats, and with one and one-third nephrectomized rats obtained by unilateral nephrectomy and infarction of one-third of the remaining kidney. Rats at each level of renal mass were maintained on chow containing either 6% or 40% protein content. Separate cohorts of rats were studied four and eight months after ablation and institution of these dietary regimens. At both time intervals and at all levels of renal mass, rats fed the high protein diet had higher average values for GFR than comparable animals fed the low protein chow. Within each of the dietary regimens the animals with loss of renal mass developed greater prevalences of sclerotic glomeruli by eight months. Furthermore, at each level of initial renal mass, rats eating the high protein diet had a greater prevalence of sclerotic glomeruli than those on the low protein diet. Similarly, rats on the high protein diet had greater rates of protein excretion than those on the low protein diet at each degree of ablation. The prevalence of sclerosed glomeruli increased between four and eight months in each group. Thus, the extent of renal injury as manifested by proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis was directly related to the degree of initial loss of renal mass, and dietary protein restriction retarded these manifestations of injury across a wide range of initial renal mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Two different preparations were utilized to study the effect of this treatment on the active mechanisms of Na+ reabsorption of kidney proximal tubular cells: outermost kidney cortex slices (rich in proximal tubules) and inside-out basolateral plasma membrane vesicles prepared from the same tissue. It was found that the activity of the ouabain-insensitive, Na-pump of basolateral plasma membranes of kidney proximal tubular cells was increased in about 70%, whereas the ouabain-sensitive, Na,K-pump activity did not change with the experimental treatment. These results represent a strong support to the two Na-pump's hypothesis since the treatment affected the Na-pump differentially without affecting the Na,K-pump.",

            "input": "Abstract: Following nephrectomy and acute potassium loading, animals previously maintained on a high potassium diet have a smaller increment in plasma potassium than do animals on a control diet. The mechanism of this \"extrarenal potassium adaptation\" is not known. To explore the role of potassium depletion in this process, we studied rats adapted to either a high potassium (HK) or control (C) diet. When dietary potassium was withdrawn, urinary potassium losses in HK rats greatly exceeded those in C rats for at least two days, leading to greater potassium depletion in HK than C animals. A smaller increment in plasma potassium in HK compared to C rats was seen only after prolonged fasting preceded nephrectomy and acute potassium loading. Correction of potassium depletion incurred during fasting abolished extrarenal potassium adaptation. We conclude: after withdrawal of dietary potassium, urinary potassium losses are much greater in HK than in C rats; if the duration of dietary potassium deprivation is sufficient, these urinary potassium losses will cause potassium-adapted animals to paradoxically become more potassium depleted than controls; and this paradoxical potassium depletion may be responsible for extrarenal potassium adaptation.",

            "input": "Abstract: A partial renal vein constriction (RVC) was induced acutely in Munich-Wistar rats. RVC caused a marked reduction in glomerular plasma flow rate, and rises in glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and efferent arteriolar resistance. These changes were associated with a marked increase in urinary protein excretion, on average from a baseline level of 8 to approximately 120 mg/24 hrs per kidney. Infusion of saralasin, an angiotensin II (AII) antagonist, largely normalized these indices, including urinary protein excretion (to approximately 35 mg/24 hrs per kidney), despite continued RVC. In separate rats, fractional clearances of neutral [125I]dextrans (molecular radii = 18-60 A) (CDEX/CIN) were measured. RVC caused a significant increase in CDEX/CIN for large dextrans (greater than or equal to 44A), but not small dextrans (less than or equal to 42A). Saralasin infusion led to a partial return toward baseline values of CDEX/CIN for the large dextrans. On the basis of the heteroporous membrane theory for glomerular filtration, the glomerular sieving defect during RVC was attributed to an increase in the relative fluid flux through a group of large non-selective pores. A marked alteration in glomerular microcirculatory pattern induced by enhanced action of endogenous AII in turn seemed to account largely, although not entirely, for the impairment of glomerular size-selectivity during RVC.",

            "input": "Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate cortical collecting tubule (CCT) function in normal individuals and in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (DRTA) using furosemide (80 mg orally) as a tool to stimulate H+ and K+ secretion by enhancing Na delivery and transport in this nephron segment. In ten normal subjects, furosemide resulted in a fall in urine pH below 5.5 and an increase in net acid and K+ excretion. These effects were obliterated by amiloride, a drug which decreases transtubular epithelial voltage (lumen-negative) in the CCT by blocking Na reabsorption. In 13 patients with DRTA, defined by failure to lower urine pH below 5.5 during acidemia, three distinctive responses to furosemide were found. In six patients with the hyperkalemic variety, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5 and resulted in a blunted increase in K+ excretion, thereby suggesting that a normal transtubular voltage in the CCT could not be generated in such patients. In five patients with classic RTA, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5, but K+ excretion increased normally. The increase in K+ excretion indicated that a normal transtubular voltage in the CCT could be generated, while the inability to lower urine pH denotes the presence of a proton pump defect involving the CCT. In two patients with classic RTA, furosemide resulted in both a normal fall in urine pH and an increase in K+ excretion, thereby indicating that the CCT was normal in regards to both proton pump function and in its ability to generate a normal transtubular voltage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

            "input": "Abstract: Synthetic polycations have been shown to bind and neutralize glomerular polyanions (GPA), thereby increasing the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall (GCW). In the present study it is demonstrated that human platelet-derived cationic proteins (HuPlt CP), which are able to increase cutaneous vascular permeability, bind in vitro to the GCW following incubation of normal human kidney sections with purified HuPlt CP or with washed human platelets stimulated with thrombin, immune complexes (IC) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), or stimulated with a suspension of washed human platelets and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of phagocytable substrate. The antiserum used in immunofluorescence test to detect the binding of HuPlt CP was specific for two different molecular types of HuPlt CP, both with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.5. Glomerular deposits of HuPlt CP were also detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy in renal glomeruli present in tissue obtained by biopsy from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease in which platelets have been implicated as mediator of glomerular injury. These data indicate that when activated platelets release HuPlt CP in vivo, these proteins bind to glomerular structures. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW appears to be ionic in nature since heparin, a polyanion, prevents this binding in vitro. In addition, heparin, as well as a high molarity buffer, removed deposits of HuPlt CP bound in vitro to normal GCW or bound in vivo to glomeruli of patients with SLE. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW is associated with loss of colloidal iron staining, a qualitative technique that demonstrates primarily epithelial cell surface anionic sialoglycoproteins. In experiments of in vitro binding of purified HuPlt CP to section of normal kidney treatment with heparin completely restores the normal pattern of colloidal iron staining suggesting ionic neutralization of GPA. In contrast, heparin is only partially effective in restoring colloidal iron staining in normal kidney sections treated with platelets directly stimulated with IC or PAF or in kidney sections of patients with SLE. These observations indicate that under these conditions the ionic interaction of HuPlt CP with GCW is only partially responsible for the loss of colloidal iron staining. The results of the present study suggest that biologically active polycationic mediators released from stimulated platelets localize in GCW and participate in the induction of glomerular injury.",

Our data demonstrate a statistically significant increase of free DA and free NE concentration in CRFh, while that of free EPI was not different from controls. However a careful scrutiny of 35 individual data suggests that sub-groups of patients with either high normal or low plasma-free NE concentration could exist; this likely heterogeneity could be a good explanation for conflicting conclusions provided by previous reports. Suspecting that conjugated CA might be altered in CRFh, plasma sulfo- and glucuro-conjugated DA, NE and EPI were also measured. We have found a predictable and highly significant increase of sulfo-conjugated CA; plasma concentration of glucuro-conjugated DA and NE in CRFh was not different from controls, while that of glucuro-conjugated EPI was significantly increased. The physiological meaning, if any, of these new observations on conjugated CA cannot be assessed at the moment. The effects of hemodialysis were also investigated. Measurements on the arterial and on the venous line showed highly significant differences for tyrosine, free and sulfo-conjugated CA, and a lack of difference for glucuro-conjugated CA. Thus tyrosine, free and sulfo-conjugated CA were eliminated by the artificial kidney, but not glucuro-conjugated amines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The antigens were solubilized by treating the tissue samples with the proteolytic enzymes collagenase, trypsin and pepsin. Total collagen content (as indicated by hydroxyproline concentration) increased with age, and the proportion of the collagen that could be solubilized by any enzyme treatment decreased. The type IV collagen concentration increased significantly with age, whereas the laminin concentration tended to decrease. In the one case of a type I diabetic the amounts of both antigens exceeded those in the age matched controls. In four type II diabetics the results were comparable with those for other aged cases. The distribution of the proteins was studied using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The staining intensity and thickness of both antigens increased with age in the mesangium and Bowmans capsules, the change in type IV collagen staining being more evident. In diabetic patients these changes were more pronounced and other basement membranes appeared thicker in the stainings. These results indicate that basement membrane material accumulates in the kidney cortex during aging and that an alteration takes place in the composition of the basement membranes, the proportion of type IV collagen increasing and that of laminin decreasing.",

A coincident allergen injection may have been a contributing factor in the sudden development of the nephrotic syndrome. Markedly elevated levels of circulating immune complexes (greater than 6400 mg/dl) were found containing kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA), the latter predominating. Markedly elevated serum BSA hemagglutinating titers were also present (1:40,960). Cross-reacting precipitating antibodies to BSA, beef, and pork were demonstrated, but not to flounder or ovalbumin. Renal biopsy revealed immune complex glomerulonephritis with BSA, immunoglobulins M and G and complement deposited focally in the glomerular basement membrane. With strict dietary limitation of identified causative antigens and prednisone therapy, CIC levels decreased to 16,000 micrograms/dl and serum BSA antibody hemagglutinating titer fell 32-fold over a period of 15 months. There was prompt symptomatic relief and amelioration of signs of nephritis. The patient was able to consume a diet normal in protein and caloric content, and statural catch-up growth occurred. Recognition of food antigens to which the patient was hypersensitive provided a rationale for the relief of the gastrointestinal disturbance, growth stunting, and renal disease.",

The concentrations of the elements Cs, Cu, Fe, and Mn in serum and packed cells appeared to be maintained within the normal range, while the levels of the non-essential element Br in both serum and packed cells were subnormal. The serum Cr values were extremely high (20 to 50 times higher than the normal serum level). The amount of Cr absorbed from the dialysate was calculated to be ten times higher than the daily dietary uptake. The Co concentrations were normal in packed cells but were significantly increased in serum. The Rb content in packed cells was slightly lower than normal, while the serum value was normal. Se was maintained within the normal range in packed cells, but the serum concentration was slightly lower than normal. The concentrations of Zn were low in serum and appeared to be higher than normal in packed cells. In conclusion, this analysis of the trace element status of CAPD patients reveals two major abnormalities. There is an apparent loss of Br from the blood towards the dialysate and on the other hand, a dramatic accumulation of Cr into the blood as a result of the very high Cr content in the dialysate.",

            "input": "Abstract: The role in the pathogenesis of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis of C5 or some terminal complement component dependent upon C5 for activation was explored in a congenic strain of C5 sufficient (NSN) and C5 deficient (OSN) mice. When these mice were given daily injections of heterologous protein, horse apoferritin (HAF), there were profound differences between the strains in the development of glomerulonephritis and renal dysfunction. When NSN and OSN mice produced low levels of anti-HAF, NSN mice developed extensive glomerular deposits of HAF and immune reactants and a mild proliferative glomerulonephritis. In contrast, comparable OSN mice developed only trace mesangial localization of HAF and no glomerular lesions by light microscopy. When NSN and OSN mice produced high levels of anti-HAF, both strains had equivalent glomerular immune deposits; however, NSN mice developed a severe necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, while OSN mice had much less glomerular injury. Compared to OSN mice, these NSN mice also had much more severe tubulointerstitial injury, and significantly higher serum creatinine levels. Thus, in this experimental model, the absence of C5 resulted in reduced glomerular immune complex localization when there were small amounts of circulating immune reactants; and in markedly reduced glomerular leukocyte influx, necrosis and crescent formation, when large amounts of immune reactants have localized in glomeruli. These effects could be mediated by C5 (such as C5a) or by some terminal complement component(s) dependent upon C5 for activation.",

R rats showed reduced growth, slower increase in plasma creatinine, lower mortality rate, and less histological renal damage than L rats. 2) Two types of CHO restriction, low glucose (R1 rats) or low starch (R2 rats) were compared to \"ad lib\" feeding (L1 rats) in adult rats (initial weight: 130 g). Growth was identically reduced in R1 and R2 rats. Mean plasma creatinine levels at week four was lower in R1 than in L1 rats. The overall rate mortality was higher for L1 and R2 than in R1 rats (79%, 81%, 53%) but included deaths from other causes than renal failure. Actuarial survival excluding these deaths was 27%, 83% and 10% in L1, R1 and R2 rats, respectively. Diffuse renal lesions were found in 25 of 30 L1, 5 of 15 R1, and 12 of 15 R2 rats (R1 vs. R1 and R2, P less than 0.01). The results show that CHO restriction may preserve the renal parenchyma, and suggest that restriction of \"simple\" rather than \"complex\" CHO restriction may be beneficial, a finding which could be of clinical importance if confirmed by further investigations.",

Alterations in the secretion of parathyroid hormone and in the metabolism of vitamin D may contribute to such skeletal changes. To minimize the influence of these factors, quantitative bone histology and measurements of bone formation using double tetracycline labeling were done in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats with MA induced by ammonium chloride (TPTX-A), and in both non-acidotic TPTX (TPTX-C) and intact (C) controls. To evaluate the response of both cortical and trabecular bone to MA, histologic studies were done at three separate sites in the tibia, cortical bone from the mid-shaft, and trabecular bone from the epiphysis and from the metaphysis. Plasma pH was lower in TPTX-A, 7.24 +/- 0.10, than in either TPTX-C, 7.39 +/- 0.03, or C, 7.43 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.01, and urinary hydroxyproline excretion increased from 89.8 +/- 8.7 in TPTX-C to 150.2 +/- 25.9 micrograms/mg/creatinine in TPTX-A, P less than 0.01.

Resorption surface was unchanged at other skeletal sites, but total bone volume at the metaphysis fell from 15.5 +/- 5.6% in TPTX-C to 9.0 +/- 4.3% in TPTX-A, P less than 0.05.

All patients underwent bone biopsies. Histomorphometry of static and dynamic parameters of bone structure, bone formation and resorption, and quantitation of stainable bone aluminum at the osteoid-bone interface were performed. In addition, bone aluminum content was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Bone aluminum content was elevated in all patients (81 +/- 9.6 vs. 18 +/- 6 micrograms/g dry wt) and stainable aluminum was found in 47% of them. All patients with predominant low-turnover osteomalacia or adynamic bone disease displayed stainable bone aluminum. In contrast, stainable bone aluminum was not present in individuals with predominant-hyperparathyroid bone disease. Patients with stainable aluminum had lower bone mass (P less than 0.05), higher volume and surface of lamellar osteoid (P less than 0.01), less volume and surface of woven osteoid (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01), lower osteoblastic and osteoclastic indices (P less than 0.01), less doubly labelled osteoid seams, lower mineral apposition rate and lower bone formation rates (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01). Stainable aluminum correlated with volume of lamellar osteoid and cellular parameters of bone formation and resorption, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rates (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.001). In contrast, bone aluminum content correlated with volume of lamellar osteoid only (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that stainable aluminum at the mineralization front and not aluminum content of bone reflects the histopathologic changes found in bone of dialyzed patients.",

The number of measure points was 113 in the nephrotic syndrome and 92 in renal failure. In both groups blood volume was normal at normal extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Elevation of ECFV to 300% of normal in the nephrotic syndrome occurred with only a modest elevation of blood volume (NS). Elevation of ECFV to 200% of normal in the patients with renal failure was attended by a major elevation of blood volume (P less than 0.01). Reduction of ECFV to about 10% below normal was accompanied by parallel blood volume reduction in both groups. Blood pressure was comparable at normohydration, and increased to clearly hypertensive levels only in the renal failure group with increasing ECFV and blood volume (P less than 0.01). No major blood pressure difference was observed between normal and subnormal hydration, but hypotension was observed twice in the nephrotic group. Apparently, patients with severe hypoproteinemia due to the nephrotic syndrome are generally able to preserve their blood volume even when free of edema. However, their blood volume is not elevated in overhydration, in contrast to patients with renal failure who are normoproteinemic. This difference in regulation of extracellular fluid distribution is probably related to the hypoproteinemia, and its effect to reduce tissue-fluid protein.",

It is possible that low energy intakes are an adaptive response to reduced energy needs; alternatively, energy expenditure could be normal or high and the low energy intakes would be inappropriate. Energy expenditure was therefore measured by indirect calorimetry in 12 normal individuals, 10 nondialyzed patients with chronic renal failure, and 16 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Energy expenditure was measured in the resting state, during quiet sitting, during controlled exercise on an exercise bicycle, and for four hours after ingestion of a test meal. Resting energy expenditure (kcal/min/1.73 m2) in the normal subjects, chronically uremic patients and hemodialysis patients was, respectively, 0.94 +/- 0.24 (SD), 0.91 +/- 0.20, and 0.97 +/- 0.10. There was also no difference among the three groups in energy expenditure during sitting, exercise, or the postprandial state. Within each group, energy expenditure during resting and sitting was directly correlated. During bicycling, energy expenditure was directly correlated with work performed, and the regression equation for this relationship was similar in each of the three groups. These findings suggest that for a given physical activity, energy expenditure in nondialyzed, chronically uremic patients and maintenance hemodialysis patients is not different from normal. The low energy intakes of many of these patients may be inadequate for their needs.",

However, phosphorus absorption is difficult to quantitate in dialysis patients because the dialysis treatments complicate metabolic balance studies. Utilizing a recently developed technique which permits measurement of net absorption of dietary constituents after a single meal, we measured phosphorus absorption in dialysis patients. The following observations were made: A.) Following a meal containing approximately 300 mg phosphorus, mean phosphorus absorption in five hemodialysis patients (with severe vitamin D deficiency) was only slightly less than in matched controls (186 +/- 35 vs. 242 +/- 30). B.) After dialysis patients were treated with 1,25(OH)2-D3, phosphorus absorption increased from 186 +/- 35 to 272 +/- 16 mg (P less than 0.025). C.) The effect of three aluminum containing antacids on phosphorus absorption was studied; each slightly reduced the absorption of phosphorus compared to placebo (P less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference between them. D.) Aluminum hydroxide and calcium carbonate each reduced dietary phosphorus absorption to approximately the same extent. Calcium carbonate ingestion was associated with sharply increased calcium absorption. The absorption of dietary phosphorus is influenced only modestly by 1,25(OH)2-D3 and is inhibited to an equal but only modest degree by various aluminum antacids and by calcium carbonate.",

However, the time course of these acute effects and whether they are sustained during chronic exposure to the NSAIDs are unknown. Accordingly, using standard clearance and balance techniques, we investigated the effects of acute (zero to four hours) and chronic (five days) oral administration of two different NSAIDs on renal function in patients with stable, mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and in normal subjects. In patients, acute oral administration of ketoprofen (K) and indomethacin (I) resulted in significant decreases in GFR (K: from 36 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 4 ml/min, P = 0.001; I: from 37 +/- 6 to 30 +/- 7 ml/min, P = 0.032; in RPF (K: from 194 +/- 21 to 146 +/- 21 ml/min, P = 0.002; I: from 222 +/- 33 to 147 +/- 18 ml/min, P = 0.016); and in urinary PGE2 excretion (K: from 0.60 +/- 0.25 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 ng/min, P = 0.05; I: from 0.34 +/- 0.06 to 0.18 +/- 0.06 ng/min, P = 0.042).

Sixteen patients with metastatic prostate cancer who had failed prior hormone therapy were entered into the study. Treatment consisted of 6 X 10(6) units of Interferon-beta intravenously three times per week for 12 weeks. Chills and fever were seen in ten of the 16 patients (62.5%), and mild hematologic toxicity occurred in four patients. No complete or partial responses were observed. Three patients had stable disease by NPCP criteria for a mean duration of 6.3 months. Progression of disease was seen in 13 of the 16 patients, eight of whom progressed during therapy. The results of this study suggest that Interferon-beta has limited efficacy in the treatment of advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",

All patients were laparotomized and six patients presented with an acute abdomen and were subjected to emergency operations. In seven cases, gastrointestinal malignancy was not suspected preoperatively. The patients were treated with a combination of surgery, cytostatic therapy, and/or radiotherapy. Cases with localized disease had a favorable prognosis, seven of nine patients being alive 31 to 70 months after diagnosis. A statistically significant difference in median survival was also noted between patients with lymphomas of low-grade and high-grade malignancy (70+ vs. 10.5 months).",

To determine if histochemical acid mucopolysaccharide content in GBA has prognostic value, GBA histologic sections from 26 advanced stage disease patients participating in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) treatment study EST-2273 were stained with alcian blue at pH. 1.0, assessed by a pathology panel for either high (greater than 50%) or low (less than 50%) acid mucopolysaccharide content, and correlated with patient survival. Initial panel unanimous concurrence rate on acid mucopolysaccharide content was 88.9%. Median survival times from the start of chemotherapy to date of death for high acid mucopolysaccharide content GBA was 14 weeks versus five weeks for the low content GBA (P less than 0.0001). The results indicate that high acid mucopolysaccharide content in GBA significantly improves prognosis.

Superficial esophageal ulceration suggestive of esophagitis was demonstrated by radiographic examination in 33% of the patients (5/15). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed superficial ulceration and white mucosal patches in all patients. There was no morbidity associated with the endoscopic procedures. Sixty-one percent of the patients (11/18) had monilia albicans cultured from the oropharyngeal cavity, and 50% (9/18) had monilia cultured from the esophageal lesions. The evolution of the esophagitis correlated well with the survival of the patients. The monilial esophagitis persisted in six patients who all died within 24 days of systemic moniliasis. After initial improvement five additional patients succumbed; three of them from severe fungal infection. There was resolution of the esophagitis in the remaining seven patients who survived longer. However, two of them had recurrent monilial esophagitis and succumbed to systemic candidiasis. The other five have remained free of esophagitis, their underlying malignancies have remained under control, and so far they have survived an average of one and a half years. Endoscopy is more accurate than radiography in detecting postchemotherapy esophagitis. This complication can be fatal, since it is often followed by systemic candidiasis.",

Good prognostic factors were T1N0, T2N0, superficial tumors, tumor shrinkage by 75% with external beam, and no apparent tumor clinically 2 months after treatment. On the other hand, T3N0, T1-3N1, and deeply necrotic tumors had a poor prognosis. We recommend using a flexible afterloading system to implant the initial local tumor volume (not just the residual nidus) that does not exceed 45 cm3. The minimum (reference) dose was prescribed to a surface 1/2 cm beyond the most peripheral rim of radioactive sources. For acceptable local control and complication rates, our suggested minimum (reference) doses are less than or equal to 7,500 rads for T1 (or a time-dose-fractionation [TDF] of 131-140), less than or equal to 8,000 rads for T2 (TDF of 131-140), and probably less than 8,500 rads for T3 (TDF of less than or equal to 150).

            "input": "Abstract: From February 1984 to March 1986, 28 patients underwent a new technique of coarctation repair. This technique consists of a complete mobilization of the left subclavian artery extended to the origin of its first branches. The aorta need not be extensively mobilized and the intercostal arteries are individually controlled with snares. After all the proper clamping, the left subclavian artery is detached from the aorta at its origin and is opened longitudinally on its posterior aspect. The anterior wall of the aorta is then incised, beginning with the opening at the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending distally to the descending aorta 12 to 15 mm past the coarctation. The coarctation membrane is excised and the ductus is ligated and divided. The opened left subclavian artery, now forming a flap, is pulled down and sutured to the edges of the aorta, widening the coarctation site and also preserving the blood flow to the left arm. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 months to 25 years (mean 4.24 +/- 4.9 years) and their weights ranged from 2.8 to 52 kg (mean: 14.8 +/- 10.0 kg). There were no hospital deaths and the mean follow-up was 9.6 months (+/- 4.9 months). Recatheterization of four patients from 4 to 12 months postoperatively showed adequate correction and strongly suggested normal growth of the aorta at the site of coarctation, as well as preservation of the blood flow through the left subclavian artery. Doppler measurements showed normal flow to the left arm and no gradients through the isthmic area. Our experience indicates that this technique is not only feasible but is the procedure of choice in most cases of discrete isthmic coarctation and in some cases of long narrowing of the isthmus in patients with a wide range of ages and weights.",

Between 1975 and 1986, aspirin or aspirin with dipyridamole has been used for anticoagulation in children receiving a mechanical aortic valve at the University of California, San Francisco. Fifty-one patients (ages 1 to 23 years, mean 12.9 years) were treated with aspirin (n = 45) or aspirin with dipyridamole (n = 6) and observed a mean of 36.5 months (range 3 to 100 months). There were four late deaths: two from endocarditis and two from other medical problems, but none related to thrombosis or embolus. Follow-up was accomplished by direct contact with the patient, parent, or referring physician. Two patients (3.9%) were lost to late follow-up. One minor neurologic event occurred perioperatively and resolved spontaneously. There were no postoperative thromboembolic events. Eleven asymptomatic children were recently studied by magnetic resonance imaging or computed axial tomography of the brain and had no evidence of prior silent cerebral thromboembolic defects. There were four patients (5.9%) who had minor hemorrhagic complications: Three patients had nosebleeds and one patient had an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Five patients were changed to warfarin anticoagulation: the patient with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and four older patients because of physician preference, all after uncomplicated aspirin therapy. There were no mechanical valve failures, although one patient required reoperation 9 months later for perivalvular leak. All children have remained in normal sinus or paced rhythm during follow-up. These results show that children with mechanical aortic valves in normal sinus rhythm can be safely treated with aspirin (or aspirin with dipyridamole) with little risk of thromboembolic events, valve thrombosis, or valve failure. Hemorrhagic complications resulting from aspirin are minor and easily treated.",

Among 167 consecutive patients undergoing modified Fontan procedures from 1973 through 1985, 109 (65%) patients exceeded one or more of the original selection criteria in areas of age, anomalies of systemic or pulmonary venous connection, pulmonary artery distortion, and pulmonary artery pressure. Twenty-six patients had a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 15 mm Hg, with 16 operative survivors (62%). Nineteen patients had anomalies of systemic and/or pulmonary venous connection, and 16 survived (84%). There were 44 patients under the age of 4 years, and 26 survived (59%). Twenty-five patients were older than 15 years, and 23 (92%) survived the Fontan procedure. Pulmonary artery distortion, relating to prior palliative operations, was found in 34 patients. Seventeen of these 34 survived a modified Fontan procedure (50%). Twenty-six patients had a pulmonary arteriolar resistance more than 2 Wood units times square meter, and 14 survived (54%), whereas 81 of 93 with a pulmonary arteriolar resistance of less than 2 U X m2 survived (87%). Multivariate analysis showed that pulmonary arteriolar resistance and pulmonary artery distortion had a significant, negative impact on survival, but age and anomalies of systemic and/or pulmonary venous connection did not. Pulmonary artery pressure was not an independent predictor of outcome. The results show that the original criteria may be exceeded in the areas of age and anomalies of pulmonary or systemic venous connection. Pulmonary artery pressure alone should not contraindicate a Fontan procedure if pulmonary arteriolar resistance is low. Pulmonary artery distortion from a prior palliative operation and elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance increase the risk of a Fontan procedure.",

            "input": "Abstract: This study compares the clinical results of two basic variations of the modified Fontan/Kreutzer operation, direct atriopulmonary connection without an interposed valve versus atrioventricular connection using the native pulmonary valve and the potential pumping capability of the subpulmonary ventricular chamber. From January 1979 through June 1985, 84 patients with tricuspid atresia and ventriculoarterial concordance underwent the modified Fontan/Kreutzer operation at the Mayo Clinic. Sixty patients had atriopulmonary connection and 24 patients had atrioventricular connections. Preoperative characteristics of the two patient groups were similar, but there was a greater frequency of Waterston shunts in the atriopulmonary group (38% versus 17%) and greater frequency of Glenn shunts in the atrioventricular group (46% versus 15%). Mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance was 1.9 +/- 0.7 units in the atriopulmonary group and 1.1 +/- 0.8 units in the atrioventricular group (p less than 0.01). Early postoperatively, mean right atrial pressure was slightly higher in the atriopulmonary group than in the atrioventricular group (18 +/- 3 versus 16 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), but this difference was not reflected in the early or late results. Operative mortality was 5% for patients with atriopulmonary connections and 4% for patients with atrioventricular connections. At 3.5 years postoperatively, the overall survival rate was 89% +/- 4% for patients with atriopulmonary connection and 88% +/- 7% for patients with atrioventricular connections. We conclude that there is no important difference in the clinical outcome of patients undergoing modified Fontan/Kreutzer repair for tricuspid atresia with atrioventricular concordance with either of the two operative methods. The choice of the connection should be dictated by the anatomy, such as presence of pulmonary valve or arterial stenoses, size of outlet chamber, and the presence of anomalous coronary arteries.",

            "input": "Abstract: One hundred two patients, aged 0.7 to 38 years, with a wide variety of cardiac malformations underwent the Fontan operation (1975 to April, 1985). Several different techniques were used. All but 17 had previously undergone one or more palliative operations. Follow-up information was obtained in all patients. Overall actuarial survival rate, with time zero being the time of the operation, was 63% at 6 years with no deaths after that in patients followed as long as out to 9.4 years; that for patients with tricuspid atresia was 81%. The hazard function (instantaneous risk) for death was highest immediately after operation and merged after about 6 months with a constant hazard extending as long as the patients were followed. Elevated post-repair right atrial pressure was correlated (p = 0.002) with the probability of death in the early phase, with the risk rising rapidly with pressures above 14 mm Hg. Hypertrophy of the ventricular main chamber was a risk factor for death in both the early (p = 0.007) and late (p = 0.008) phases of hazard, which explained in part the lesser risk of the Fontan operation in patients with tricuspid atresia. Younger age, but not older age, was a risk factor for early postoperative death, but this risk was neutralized by recent date of operation. Thus currently there is not a predicted increased risk associated with younger age at operation. In general, the Fontan operation should be done at a young age (2 to 4 years) to avoid increasing ventricular hypertrophy, but older age per se is not a contraindication to the operation.",

            "input": "Abstract: The relationship between the perfusion flow rate and cerebral oxygen consumption during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at 20 degrees C was investigated in dogs. In 10 dogs the perfusion flow rate was decreased in steps from 100 to 60, 30, and 15 ml/kg/min every 30 minutes. Although cerebral blood flow decreased as perfusion flow rate decreased, the ratio of cerebral blood flow to the perfusion flow rate increased significantly (p less than 0.05) at a perfusion flow rate of 15 ml/kg/min compared to that at a perfusion flow rate of 100 or 60 ml/kg/min. The arterial-sagittal sinus blood oxygen content difference increased as perfusion flow rate decreased. Consequently, cerebral oxygen consumption did not vary significantly at perfusion flow rates of 100 (0.48 +/- 0.10), 60 (0.43 +/- 0.14), and 30 ml/kg/min (0.44 +/- 0.12 ml/100 gm/min), and it decreased significantly to 0.31 +/- 0.22 ml/100 gm/min at a perfusion flow rate of 15 ml/kg/min. In five dogs the perfusion flow rate was decreased in one step from 100 to 15 ml/kg/min, and after 60 minutes' perfusion at a perfusion flow rate of 15 ml/kg/min, the perfusion flow rate was returned to 100 ml/kg/min. Cerebral oxygen consumption decreased significantly during 60 minutes' perfusion at a perfusion flow rate of 15 ml/kg/min and did not return to its initial value after the perfusion flow rate was returned to 100 ml/kg/min. These data indicate that the optimal perfusion flow rate for the brain during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at 20 degrees C appears to be 30 ml/kg/min, with a possible oxygen debt in the brain resulting in anaerobic metabolism if the perfusion flow rate is kept at 15 ml/kg/min or less.",

Use of the internal mammary artery was indicated in young or middle-aged patients with the following characteristics: a significant lesion of the proximal left anterior descending artery or its diagonal branch alone (70.1%) or combined with diffuse atherosclerosis (19.9%) or a small caliber (3.4%); absent or unsuitable veins for grafting (5.5%); atherosclerosis or an aneurysm of the ascending aorta (0.6%); and failure of previous vein grafts (0.5%). The left anterior descending artery system was grafted by the left internal mammary artery in 53.2%, and the arterial graft was complimented by vein grafts in 2.6%. In 45.2% of the patients, grafts of the left anterior descending artery by the left internal mammary artery were supplemented by vein grafts to the right coronary artery (23.8%), to the circumflex artery (15.2%), or to both (6.2%). The overall operative mortality was 2.2%. It rose to 16.7% with associated cardiac procedures and to 18.5% in patients who were in New York Heart Association Class IV. If these two high-risk categories of patients are excluded, the perioperative death rate in the remaining 750 was only 0.4%. Of the 815 patients who survived the perioperative period (mean 53.1 months follow-up), 63.1% were relieved of angina and 83.4% were in Class I or II of the New York Heart Association, as compared to 27.4% before the operation. At cardiac recatheterization (mean 18.9 months), 87.9% of the internal mammary artery grafts and 63.3% of the vein grafts were patent (p less than 0.05). The cumulative actuarial 10 year survival rate was 88.6% +/- 1.3%.",

Direct visualization of the atherosclerotic plaques and demonstration of their precise location and extent was achieved by magnetic resonance imaging. The size and extent of the aneurysms and the presence of mural thrombus were demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging identified the intimal flap and indicated the proximal extent of thoracic aortic dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging permitted direct visualization of thrombi and aneurysm of the pulmonary arteries. In conclusion, magnetic resonance imaging appears to be a totally noninvasive and reliable technique for demonstration of various pathologic processes involving the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries. Vascular imaging is achieved without the need for contrast media.",

            "input": "Abstract: Coronary angioscopy provides images of intravascular detail with greater than 0.2 mm spatial resolution and excellent contrast resolution. Using endoscopes of 1.25 to 1.8 mm outer diameter, we performed intraoperative angioscopy of the coronary arteries or saphenous vein grafts, or both, in 58 patients. Eighty-one native coronary arteries and 43 vein grafts were examined. A clear viewing field was created by infusion of crystalloid cardioplegic solution through the aortic root during cardiopulmonary bypass. Technical details crucial for obtaining high-quality images were as follows: sufficient coronary perfusion by cardioplegic solution to displace all blood; adequate intraluminal illumination; and high-quality fiberoptic and lens systems. Incomplete studies in approximately 14% of patients were related to failure to achieve these technical details and lack of scope steerability. In 30% of patients, previously unrecognized anatomic details were revealed by angioscopy. These included intimal flaps at the site of vein-to-artery anastomoses, atheromatous plaques with adherent thrombi, and hemorrhagic ulcerated plaques, not recognized on angiography. Although a coronary intimal flap developed proximal to the anastomosis during retrograde examination in two patients, no serious complications occurred as a result of the procedure. We conclude that intraoperative angioscopy is safe, provides novel information that may be clinically relevant, and has future potential for development of the techniques for coronary endarterectomy and intraoperative balloon and laser angioplasty.",

Causes included gunshot wounds in 89 patients, stab wounds in 65, and blunt trauma in 11. Mortality rates were 18%, 5%, and 27%, respectively, deaths being caused primarily by bleeding from associated injuries. Operations on these patients included laparotomy in 123 (75%), thoracotomy in four (2%), and both in 38 (23%). The mortality rates for these operations were 0%, 50%, and 53%, respectively. A presumptive preoperative diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury from chest x-ray findings was possible in only 24 (15%) patients. Of 42 thoracotomies, five were performed in the emergency department for cardiac arrest, with three (60%) deaths. Of 37 thoracotomies performed in the operating room, 17 were for thoracic injuries with six (35%) deaths and 20 were for resuscitation for abdominal injuries with 13 (65%) deaths. In most patients, the diaphragmatic injury was critical only in warning the surgeon that severe injuries might be present in both the chest and abdomen. Of 43 patients admitted with a blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg or four or more associated injuries, 22 died. However, even in these high-risk patients, if resuscitation raised the initial operating room blood pressure to more than 70 mm Hg, reduced the shock time to less than 30 minutes, and kept blood loss below 10 units, the mortality was only 8% (1/12). In contrast, if none of these conditions could be met, the mortality in this high-risk group was 100% (16/16). Thus more aggressive resuscitative efforts and earlier control of bleeding seem to provide the best chance for improved survival.",

The value of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in screening for renovascular hypertension is less controversial, but selection of patients remains a subject for further study. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography has become a standard imaging technique that offers both the inherent safety produced by reduction of the volume of contrast material and the added safety afforded by reduction of both the size of the catheter and the time required to perform complex arterial interventional procedures. With the evolution of more sophisticated computed technology and radiographic equipment, the impact of both intravenous and arterial digital subtraction angiography will become even more dramatic.",

These studies frequently provide clues that may be useful in arriving at the appropriate therapeutic decisions and in determining prognosis. Normal results may also support a suspected clinical diagnosis of inorganic illness, providing no evidence of central nervous system disease can be defined. Like any other test, however, results of EMG may be false-negative in bona fide neuromuscular disorders. This is particularly true early in a disease process; in neuropathies restricted primarily to small, unmyelinated nerve fibers; and in certain of the less virulent diseases of muscle and muscle energy metabolism.",

The etiology of transient global amnesia is poorly understood, although involvement of the medial temporal lobe is most likely. The literature suggests that once an underlying structural lesion has been ruled out, cases can be divided into three groups: patients with a past history of migraine headaches, those who have no obvious underlying precipitating factors, and those with associated neurologic deficits during a spell and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Patients in the first group tend to have attacks at an earlier age and to have an increased recurrence rate but, like those in the second group, have a good prognosis. Patients in the third group often have onset later in life, and as many as 10% may have a stroke or dementia. Whether or not this is a higher incidence than should be expected in persons of this age group has not been determined. Although sophisticated testing may show persistence of the memory defect, most patients eventually recover completely.",

From 1945 to 1955, treatment consisted primarily of radiation. From 1955 through 1971, the primary method of treatment was surgical removal; the lateral rhinotomy approach was used to expose the tumor and its extensions in most cases. From 1971 through 1983, all tumors were removed surgically. Trends in diagnosis, treatment, and adjunctive therapy at a single institution were evaluated. Specifically, the trends considered were operative approaches, blood replacement with and without hypotensive anesthesia, adjunctive measures such as hormonal therapy or tumor embolization, mortality, and morbidity. Lateral rhinotomy provides wide exposure of and access to the nose, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, elements of the skull base, temporal fossa, and infratemporal fossa. Surgical treatment, specifically the lateral rhinotomy approach and its extensions, is recommended as the best method of managing angiofibroma in most patients.",

Two children presented with what was originally thought to be pneumonitis, but when chest x-rays were taken, one child was suspected of having an inhaled foreign body, and the other had complete opacification of one lung. When these two children were examined bronchoscopically the tracheobronchial tree was found to be filled with white, cheesy material. This material was extremely hard to remove bronchoscopically as the material was too soft to grab with forceps but too thick to suction. The material extended all the way down into the tertiary bronchi, and in one child multiple bronchoscopies were necessary to remove this material, and even so he developed bronchiectasis. The pathologic examination of these casts showed layers of inspissated mucus and inflammatory cells.",

The complex anatomy of the parotid space leads to difficulty in localizing these tumors. In addition, physical examination will rarely determine whether a parotid lesion is benign or malignant. High resolution CT scanning with contrast and fine needle aspiration can provide enough preoperative information to enable the surgeon to counsel his patient concerning possible risks and the extent of surgery that may be indicated. We are able to determine tumor location, multiple or bilateral masses, associated adenopathy, and often specific tumor histology. Forty-two parotid aspirates and 26 CT scans were reviewed and correlated with their postoperative pathology specimen. Parotid aspiration cytology was found to be a highly accurate and safe procedure for preoperative determination of parotid pathology. However, the CT scan was specific only in defining the anatomic localization and extent of a parotid mass.",

This paper presents a study of the tympanometric effects of specific eardrum scars and ossicular abnormalities in cats. For both normal eardrums and healed myringotomies, a normal middle ear could be differentiated from stapes fixation or incudostapedial discontinuity using static immittance parameters and tympanogram morphology. Twenty percent myringectomy scars caused abnormal 660 Hz tympanograms but this effect could be distinguished from changes caused by a concomitant ossicular abnormality. The very low impedance of a 50% myringectomy scar resulted in tympanograms which could not be differentiated from an ossicular discontinuity alone. With this neomembrane, stapes fixation could not even be differentiated from an ossicular discontinuity. This study supports the view that tympanometry should be interpreted as part of a battery of tests which includes otoscopy, audiometry, and acoustic reflex measurements.",

More bacterial isolates per tonsil were recovered in adults (10.2 per tonsil) than in children (8.4 per tonsil). The difference between these groups was due to a higher recovery rate in adults of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (1.6 isolates per adult, 0.8 per child) and Bacteroides fragilis group (0.4 per adult, 0.2 per child). Conversely, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated in seven (28%) children as compared to their isolation in one (4%) adult. More isolates of beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPO) per tonsil were recovered in adults. Forty-three BLPO were detected in 21 (91%) of the 23 tonsils removed from adults (1.9 isolates per patient) as compared to 31 isolates in 16 (64%) of the 25 tonsils removed from children (1.2 isolates per patient) (P = 0.04). These findings suggest that the etiology of recurrent tonsillitis in adults may differ from that in children. The differences in the tonsillar flora may be due to the effect of many more courses of antimicrobials given over the years to adults and the changes in tonsillar tissue that occur in this age group.",

They underwent complete clinical and audiological assessment and were divided into groups according to those having lived only on the island or those having lived in modern civilization. With all factors being equal, except exposure to modern civilization, our results showed that living in civilized societies has a significant negative effect on hearing; the severity is directly proportional to the years of exposure. The median hearing thresholds of natives always living on the island (men and women combined) was found to be similar to those of female citizens of the United States; there was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between men and women among these natives. These results suggest that there are no significant inherent racial differences nor significant inherent differences between males and females in the sensitivity of hearing. A relationship between aging and hearing was noted and interpreted as true or intrinsic presbycusis. There were no cases of otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, or exostoses of the external ear canal among natives who had always lived on the island. Pure natives were found not to be prone to otitis media in spite of having an extremely high incidence of severe upper respiratory tract allergies.",

The sphenoid sinus lies deep within the skull at the crossroads of 13 sensitive structures. The presence of a sphenoid sinus mucocele may be accompanied by a wide variety of signs and symptoms depending upon which of these structures are involved. The majority of these lesions are initially misdiagnosed as malignancies leading to increased patient morbidity and possible mismanagement. We present two cases of sphenoid sinus mucoceles which presented with a variety of neurological signs and symptoms. The radiographic findings were felt to be consistent with skull base malignancies. The diagnosis was corrected only after surgical exploration of the sphenoid sinus revealed a mucocele.",

Lumbar hyperextension and impact forces were quantified for performances of five commonly executed gymnastics skills by four competitive collegiate women gymnasts. The skills performed were the front walkover, the back walkover, and the front handspring, the back handspring, and the handspring vault. Wielke's (1983) radius method was used to quantify lumbar curvatures from film data during normal relaxed standing postures and during subject performances of the five selected skills. A force platform was used to monitor vertical and lateral ground reaction forces at the terminations of the respective skill performances. Of the skills examined, the handspring vault produced the highest vertical and lateral impact forces, and the back handspring and back walkover required the greatest amounts of lumbar hyperextension. During the front and back walkovers and during the back handspring, maximum lumbar hyperextension occurred very close to the time that impact force was sustained by either the hands or the feet.",

The validity of employing commonly accepted analog smoothing methods was also appraised. An inert gravitational model was used to assess the filtering requirements of two Cybex II constant velocity dynamometers at 10 pre-set speeds with three selected loads. Speed settings were recorded as percentages of the servomechanism's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (10 to 100% Vfb max). Spectral analyses of unsmoothed torque and associated angular displacement curves, followed by optimized low-pass digital filtering, revealed the presence of two superimposed contaminating influences: a damped oscillation, representing successive sudden braking and releasing of the servomechanism control system; a relatively stationary oscillatory series, which was attributed to the Cybex motor. The optimal cutoff frequency for any data set was principally a positive function of % Vfb max. This association was represented for each machine by a different, but reliable, third order least-squares polynomial, which could be used to accurately predict the correct smoothing required for any speed setting. Unacceptable errors may be induced, especially when measuring peak torques, if data are inappropriately filtered. Over-smoothing disguises inertial artefacts. The use of Cybex recorder damping settings should be discouraged. Optimal filtering is a minimal requirement of valid data processing.",

            "input": "Abstract: Measurement characteristics of two constant velocity dynamometers (Cybex II, Lumex, Inc., NY) were evaluated at 11 selected speeds (0 to 5 rad X s-1) under various conditions of inert gravitational loading. A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings.",

This study determined the effects of systematic changes in ankle and subtalar joint stabilization on performance through an obstacle course. Data were collected on six subjects as they completed two test procedures. Ankle range of motion in the sagittal and frontal planes was determined using a modified Inman apparatus. Completion time through an obstacle course, set up on a basketball court, was used as a measure of performance. High-top basketball shoes were constructed with pockets which allowed strips of plastic (stiffeners) to be positioned just anterior and posterior to the medial and lateral malleoli. Four shoe conditions were used including the shoe with no stiffeners. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) in eversion, flexion, and inversion were found between the shoe conditions. A general trend of decreased range of motion with increased restriction was observed. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) in performance were found between the shoe conditions, with a general trend of increased times with increased restriction. These results indicate that systematic changes in the range of motion of the ankle and subtalar joints can measurably affect performance.",

Subjects were evaluated before and after the 14-wk experimental period for pubertal state (Tanner's sexual maturity rating, serum testosterone, and serum dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate). Effectiveness of the strength training program was determined by measuring pre-post differences in: isokinetic strength for flexion and extension at the knee and elbow joints at two speeds (30 degrees and 90 degrees X s-1) (KIN COM, Chattecx, Inc., Chattanooga, TN), flexibility, standing long jump, vertical jump, body composition parameters, maximal oxygen consumption, and creatinine phosphokinase. Safety of strength training was assessed by biphasic musculoskeletal scintigraphy before and after the program and by physician evaluation of complaints by subjects. Strength training subjects (N = 16) participated in a 45 min/session, 3 session/wk, 14-wk supervised strength training program with an attendance rate of 91.5%. Participants performed concentric work using hydraulic resistance equipment (Hydra-Fitness Industries, Belton, TX). Eccentric work was not performed. Control subjects (N = 10) did not strength train but did participate in sport activities and activities of daily living. Results indicated that strength training subjects increased isokinetic strength as a result of strength training (average concentric work/repetition increases by 18.5 to 36.6% for the eight motions tested; torque scores over the first 90% of the range of motion increases by 13.1 to 45.1% for the eight motions tested). These changes were significantly greater than changes seen in the control group (P less than 0.05). Strength training subjects also demonstrated significant improvements (as compared to control subjects) in vertical jump (+10.4%), flexibility (+8.4%), and maximal oxygen consumption [+19.4% (l X min-1), +13.8% (ml X kg X min-1)] after the experimental period. Musculoskeletal scintigraphy revealed no evidence of damage to epiphyses, bone, or muscle as a result of strength training. Only one strength training-related injury was reported (left shoulder pain, 3 strength training sessions missed). In contrast, six strength training subjects sustained injuries during activities of daily living, resulting in 47 missed strength training sessions. It was concluded that, in the short term, supervised concentric strength training using hydraulic resistance equipment is safe and effective in pre-pubertal boys.",

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), maximal heart rate (HR max), maximal ventilation, and maximal oxygen pulse were obtained from a progressive ergocycle test to exhaustion. Total work output in a 90-min maximal ergocycle test was also determined in the twins. Fat-free weight was estimated from body density measurements obtained through underwater weighing. Aerobic performance scores were adjusted for age (brothers), and age and sex (dizygotic and monozygotic twins) by regression procedures. Dizygotic twins and brothers of same sibship exhibited about the same level of resemblance for all variables or were only slightly different, with the exception of HR max. Monozygotic pairs were generally more alike than the other sibs, as suggested by the intra-class coefficients. Twin data were used to compute the genetic effects. The within-pair estimate of genetic variance revealed that it was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) for all variables except VO2 max X kg-1 fat-free weight X min-1. In the case of HR max, the among-pairs component estimate had to be used, and it also proved significant (P less than or equal to 0.01). The size of the genetic effect was computed from three different methods, and it reached about 40% for VO2 max X kg-1 X min-1, 50% for HR max, 60% for maximal oxygen pulse and maximal ventilation, and 70% for 90-min work output X kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Residual lung volume was also predicted with gender-specific regression equations using height and age and from 24% of vital capacity (%FVC). Residual lung volume alpha reliability for the average of four residual lung volume trials exceeded 0.90 (SEM less than = 161 ml) for the oxygen dilution method and 0.99 (SEM = 30 ml) for the average of two nitrogen washout measures. The standard errors for predicted residual lung volume were 579 and 355 ml, respectively, for the men and women in the adult sample and 288 ml for the trained athlete sample. Estimating residual lung volume from %FVC yielded a SEE of 318 ml for the trained athlete sample. Measured residual lung volume errors resulted in errors of 1.04%Fat, 0.87%Fat, and 0.21%Fat for the men, women, and trained athlete samples, respectively. In contrast, predicted residual lung volume measurement errors resulted in errors of 3.70%Fat, 2.85%Fat, and 1.98%Fat for the respective samples and 2.18%Fat when using %FVC with the trained athletes.

A mechanism for the reduced risk may be through increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and subfractions, in particular HDL2-C. Research associated with increased physical activity investigating HLD-C have assessed the effects of intense aerobic activity. The current research evaluated the relationship between low intensity, long duration activity to HDL-C and subfractions in 35 active postal carriers. Measurements of physical activity via the Large Scale Integrated monitor and reported miles walked, and lipoproteins were assessed at 3-month intervals over a 1-year period. Reported miles walked/day (5.3) was significantly correlated with HLD2-C (r = 0.50, P = 0.003) and approached significance for HDL-C (r = 0.29, P = 0.06). The Large Scale Integrated measures were correlated with HDL-C (r = 0.44, P = 0.008) and HDL2-C (r = 0.44, P = 0.007). Controlling for either age, alcohol consumption, body mass index, or leisure time activity did not reduce the relationship between reported miles walked or Large Scale Integrated readings and HDL2-C, suggesting that the increased HDL-C was the result of long duration, low intensity physical activity.",

The solutions tested at rest included water, 5.0% maltodextrin, 3.0% maltodextrin + 2% glucose (MG5.0), and 4.5% maltodextrin + 2.6% fructose (MF7.1). Solutions tested during running included water, MG5.0, MF7.1, 5.5% maltodextrin + 2% glucose, and 5.5% maltodextrin + 2% fructose. At rest and during running, water emptied significantly (P less than 0.5) faster than all other drinks. In the running trials, the volume of gastric residue of 5.5% maltodextrin + 2% fructose (221.7 +/- 11.0 ml) was significantly greater than water (103.4 +/- 19.0 ml), MG5.0 (153.3 +/- 16.8 ml), and MF7.1 (167.3 +/- 14.8), suggesting an inhibitory role of glucose on gastric emptying.

Maximal oxygen uptake was measured with a progressive maximal ergocycle test, while endurance performance was determined as the total work output during a 90-min maximal ergocycle test. Results indicated that maximal oxygen uptake X kg-1 and endurance performance X kg-1 increased significantly (14 and 31%, respectively) with training, and intra-pair resemblance (intra-class) in response to 15 wk of training ranged from 0.65 to 0.83. Hexokinase (31%), phosphofructokinase (37%), lactate dehydrogenase (21%), malate dehydrogenase (31%), and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (60%) were significantly increased with training whereas no mean change in fiber-type proportions, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities and the phosphofructokinase/oxoglutarate dehydrogenase ratio was observed. Similarity within twin pairs in the response to enzyme activities was mainly detected in the second half of the training program. The present results confirm, therefore, that both maximal oxygen uptake and endurance performance responses to training are largely genotype-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of high intensity aerobic work on stress reduction and to evaluate the currently tenable hypotheses in view of the data on the response to high intensity work. The subjects participated in a control trial and two 20-min treadmill exercise trials at low and high (40% and 75% VO2max) intensity. The H- and M-wave responses to artificial stimulation of the tibial nerve (Angel and Hofmann, 1963) were used to assess spinal cord activation level which constituted the major dependent variable in the study. Low intensity exercise showed a 12.8% reduction in the H max/M max ratio (P less than 0.05) while high intensity exercise reduced the H max/M max ratio by 21.5% (P less than 0.0002). The two exercise treatment levels were also significantly different from each other (P less than 0.02). These data provide objective evidence for the efficacy of high intensity exercise in stress reduction as measured by the Hoffmann reflex and provide indirect evidence for a possible thermal hypothesis for exercise-induced stress reduction.",

The patients with rheumatoid vasculitis had decreased survival in comparison with an age-, sex-, and region-matched general population. Their survival was also decreased in comparison to that of an incidence cohort of community patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the latter cohort, decreased survival was confined to those patients with classic but not definite rheumatoid arthritis. After partial correction for referral bias, we found no difference in survival between the cohort with rheumatoid vasculitis and the cohort with classic rheumatoid arthritis. We found that the age at diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis, the therapeutic decisions before and at diagnosis, and the referral distance were the best predictors of survival. Abnormal urinary sediment and hypergammaglobulinemia also predicted poor survival, but because of a lack of specificity in a small number of clinically abnormal values, we urge a cautious interpretation of their importance.",

The number of patients diagnosed yearly has increased since CT scanning became available, but despite the enhanced sensitivity, the time from either onset of symptoms or hospital admission until initiation of therapy was not decreased and there was no dramatic effect upon morbidity or mortality in this series. Infections of paranasal sinuses, ears, lungs, and odontogenic foci were predisposing factors in approximately 70% of cases. Single abscesses, present in 75% of patients, were distributed equally in both hemispheres, with more than half in the frontal and parietal lobes. Common signs and symptoms included headache, fever, chills, seizures, nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, nuchal rigidity, and localizing neurologic signs. Blood cultures were positive in 11%. Lumbar puncture rarely provided data from which a diagnosis could be established; CSF cultures were positive in only 7% of patients, and there was a 15% temporally associated incidence of brain herniation and death. Diagnostic information was most readily obtained using imaging techniques such as CT and 99mTc scanning, and arteriography was invasive and of no added value. CT scans are however, often initially negative in patients presenting with clinical signs of meningitis presumably following rupture of an abscess into the subarachnoid space, and the average time for changes to appear on CT scan is 9 days. It is, therefore, recommended that when the clinical assessment suggests the possibility of brain abscess the patient be treated empirically with antibiotics and that lumbar puncture be performed only after thoughtful assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio for each patient. Causative organisms were isolated from more than 80% of abscesses despite prior antibiotic treatment; more than half grew a single pathogen, most commonly streptococci. Anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria accounted for 62% of all isolates, and were the only organisms in 33% of patients. Computerized tomographic scans in 30 patients showed \"ring-enhancing\" lesions, nodular enhancement, or areas of low attenuation. Complete resolution of abscesses on CT scans rarely occurred during hospitalization and took as long as 5 months. Decrease in the size of abscesses on CT scan correlated well with clinical improvement and was seen within a week when abscesses were excised, but was often not obvious for 6 to 8 weeks if antibiotics were used alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

It is known that this is not due to a numerical reduction in the population of satellite cells. We have therefore examined the ultrastructural composition of the satellite cells in 25 DMD cases and compared them with satellite cells from normal subjects and from polymyositis patients to try to identify morphological features that might be associated with an impaired developmental competence. Profiles of randomly and serially sectioned satellite cells were analyzed stereologically to obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic areas. Within the cytoplasm, the areas occupied by mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and Golgi apparatus were measured. Micropinocytotic vesicles (MPVs) at the periphery of the cells were counted. The nucleus to cytoplasm ratios and mitochondrial, RER, and Golgi volume fractions were not significantly different in the three satellite cell samples. The cells in the DMD sample contained more MPVs than those in the normal subjects. This is attributed to a generalized cell response to a physiologically altered environment in the diseased muscle.",

The Hodgkin-Huxley model was used to describe the kinetic and steady-state parameters of channel activation and fast inactivation. Chronic (7-10 days) denervation was found to cause a decreased resting potential, lowered action potential peak, and fibrillation potentials in rabbit extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. Under voltage clamp conditions, no differences were observed between denervated and normal fibers in the voltage dependence of the steady-state Na channel activation and fast inactivation curves, or in the time course of development of fast inactivation. However, in denervated fibers, the time course of recovery from fast inactivation was approximately half that measured in normal fibers. Also, whereas depolarizing holding potentials induced a long-term inactivation to varying degrees in normal EDL fibers, denervated EDL fibers and normal soleus fibers were uniformly resistant to prolonged depolarization. These results suggest that the denervation-induced development of spontaneous activity may be due in part to changes in the mechanisms that control the refractoriness of Na channels.",

In mammalian muscles, experimental denervation induces the appearance of extrajunctional acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistant action potentials (AP). These denervation changes have been investigated in muscle biopsies from 10 MND patients and in 2 traumatically denervated normal human muscles. Extrajunctional ACh sensitivity was present in 113 of the 140 (73%) fibers from MND muscles studied. In 50 of 84 (70%) ACh-sensitive fibers, no TTX-resistant AP were present. The remaining fibers (30%) showed small regenerative responses. In contrast, all the traumatically denervated muscle fibers showed extrajunctional ACh sensitivity and TTX-resistant AP. Histochemical analysis of the biopsies showed no direct correlation between the frequency of ACh-sensitive fibers and that of the atrophic or normal-appearing fibers. The absence of TTX-resistant AP in ACh-sensitive fibers and its lack of correlation with the histochemical criteria of denervation suggest the presence of a state of innervation in MMD, where the motoneuron is not able to maintain its fully trophic influence on the muscle fiber membrane.",

Sequential light microscopy in correlation with electron-microscopic and electrophysiologic analyses showed that despite cross-species innervation, these human muscle fibers develop stable cross-striations, peripherally positioned myonuclei, and mature, functional motor endplates. Of special interest is the onset of significant progressive abnormalities, e.g., unusual focal myofibrillar lesions, in substantial numbers of innervated mature DMD muscle fibers after 2-4 months in culture. The focal myofibrillar lesions were not detected in normal muscle fibers maintained as long as 6 months in coculture, nor are they comparable to the generalized loss of cross-striations observed in muscle atrophy following in vitro denervation of mature DMD fibers.",

            "input": "Abstract: Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) demonstrates abnormal jitter in virtually all (99%) patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). One muscle, the extensor digitorum communis, is abnormal in most patients with this disease, but to obtain the maximum diagnostic sensitivity, it may be necessary to examine other muscles, especially ones that are more involved clinically. There is no one muscle that will be more abnormal in every patient with MG. The muscle(s) to be tested must be selected based on the distribution of weakness in the individual patient. Abnormal jitter is also seen in diseases of nerve and muscle; these diseases must be excluded by other electrophysiologic and clinical examinations before diagnosing MG. If neuronal or myopathic disease is present, increased jitter does not indicate that MG is also present. However, if jitter is normal in a muscle with definite weakness, the weakness is not due to MG. When abnormal neuromuscular transmission has been demonstrated by repetitive nerve stimulation, the finding of abnormal jitter does not add to the diagnosis, though it may be useful in providing baseline values for comparison with the results of subsequent studies. SFEMG is most valuable clinically in the patient with suspected MG in whom other tests of neuromuscular transmission and antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titers are normal. Serial measurements of jitter can be useful in following the course of disease and in assessing the effect of treatment, but the results from these studies must always be interpreted in light of the overall clinical picture.",

In a previous study, more than a third of a group of young mothers volunteering blood samples to establish a creatine kinase (CK) reference range for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) carrier detection regularly participated in aerobic exercise programs. Aerobic exercise programs include eccentric exercises. As eccentric exercise is known to produce a delayed CK peak, this study was carried out to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on serum CK activities. The postexercise serum CK activity peak was monitored in 15 young women (age range 20-23 years) following aerobic exercise classes (45 minutes on 3 consecutive days). Peak values at 24-48 hours following the last class ranged from 90 to 3473 U/liter, or 1.55 to 34.71 times resting values. It is concluded that aerobic exercise programs should be excluded in order to obtain accurate resting serum CK values for muscle disease diagnosis.",

However, its use can induce neuropathy necessitating caution in its administration. It was found in this electrophysiologic study of 13 patients that the data best revealing neuropathy, even when clinical abnormalities were not apparent, were reduction of sensory nerve action potential amplitude on the sural nerve, increase of somatosensory evoked potential latency following sural nerve stimulation, and reduction of sensory action potential amplitude on stimulating the median nerve at the wrist. In two patients, electrophysiologic abnormalities had increased after withdrawal, suggesting a prolonged action of thalidomide. Timely reduction of dosage, after detection of changes indicating the onset of side effects, could reduce the risk of the sometimes rapid emergence of clinical symptoms.",

In particular, the potential for cocaine to precipitate life-threatening cardiac events needs to be reemphasized. We report the clinical and pathological findings in seven people in whom nonintravenous \"recreational\" use of cocaine was temporally related to acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myocarditis, sudden death, or a combination of these events. We also review data on 19 previously reported cases of cocaine-related cardiovascular disorders. Analysis of all 26 patients indicated the following findings: the cardiac consequences of cocaine abuse are not unique to parenteral use of the drug, since nearly all the patients took the drug intranasally; underlying heart disease is not a prerequisite for cocaine-related cardiac disorders; seizure activity, a well-documented noncardiac complication of cocaine abuse, is neither a prerequisite for, nor an accompanying feature of, cardiac toxicity of cocaine; and the cardiac consequences of cocaine are not limited to massive doses of the drug. Although the pathogenesis of cardiac toxicity of cocaine remains incompletely defined, available circumstantial evidence suggests that cocaine has medical consequences that are equal in importance to its well-documented psychosocial consequences.",

After controlling for the effects of age, use of an intrauterine device for contraception, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and other potential confounding variables, we found that no excess risk of tubal infertility was associated with a simple appendectomy without rupture. However, when the operation was reportedly for a ruptured appendix, the relative risk of tubal infertility was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.9) for women who had never been pregnant and 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.6) for women with one or more previous pregnancies. We conclude that the early diagnosis and treatment of suspected appendicitis in girls and women of reproductive age may reduce the incidence of tubal infertility resulting from the sequelae of a ruptured appendix.",

However, recognition of eosinophiluria by Wright's staining is technically difficult, and the spectrum of disorders causing eosinophiluria is not completely defined. We have adapted Hansel's stain for the examination of urinary sediment. Whereas there was a variable uptake of Wright's stain by eosinophils in the urine, such eosinophils were readily recognized with Hansel's stain by the presence of bright red granules. The prevalence of eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was 10 of 11 patients, in acute tubular necrosis none of 30, in acute pyelonephritis none of 10, in acute cystitis 1 of 15, in postinfectious glomerulonephritis 1 of 6, in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis 4 of 10, and in acute prostatitis 6 of 10. Eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated by Hansel's stain in 10 of 11 patients but by Wright's stain in only 2 of 11 patients. We conclude that Hansel's stain substantially improves the recognition of eosinophiluria as compared with Wright's stain. Eosinophiluria is useful in distinguishing acute interstitial nephritis from acute tubular necrosis. The clinical spectrum of eosinophiluria also includes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, acute prostatitis, and occasionally, acute cystitis or postinfectious glomerulonephritis.",

We examined the relation of base-line circulating DHEAS levels to subsequent 12-year mortality from any cause, from cardiovascular disease, and from ischemic heart disease in a population-based cohort of 242 men aged 50 to 79 years at the start of the study. Mean DHEAS levels decreased with age and were also significantly lower in men with a history of heart disease than in those without such a history. In men with no history of heart disease at base line, the age-adjusted relative risk associated with a DHEAS level below 140 micrograms per deciliter was 1.5 (P not significant) for death from any causes, 3.3 (P less than 0.05) for death from cardiovascular disease, and 3.2 (P less than 0.05) for death from ischemic heart disease. In multivariate analyses, an increase in DHEAS level of 100 micrograms per deciliter was associated with a 36 percent reduction in mortality from any causes (P less than 0.05) and a 48 percent reduction in mortality from cardiovascular disease (P less than 0.05), after adjustment for age, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, obesity, fasting plasma glucose level, cigarette smoking status, and personal history of heart disease. Our conclusions are limited by the single determination of DHEAS levels, but the data suggest that the DHEAS concentration is independently and inversely related to death from any cause and death from cardiovascular disease in men over age 50.",

The study group was markedly heterogeneous: 21 percent were not U.S. citizens at birth, 32 percent did not have English as a native language, and 12 percent had two or more years of undergraduate college education in Puerto Rico. Sixty-seven percent resided in New York, New Jersey, California, Florida, or Puerto Rico, and 74 percent studied medicine in Mexico or the Caribbean. Forty-six percent passed the ECFMG examination on their first attempt, and 22 percent passed a subsequent examination. Only 45 percent had applied to a U.S. medical school, and 65 percent had taken the Medical College Admission Test. The means of the college grade-point averages, known for 39 percent of the study group, and of the scores on the admission test, known for 65 percent, were lower than those of both accepted and unaccepted applicants to U.S. medical schools in the 1976 and 1978 entering classes. The finding that 55 percent of the study group did not apply to a U.S. medical school does not support the widely held belief that most, if not all, U.S. citizens who attend foreign medical schools do so only after several unsuccessful attempts to gain admission to a U.S. school.",

Thirty-four women received oral doses of 400 mg (in four days), 26 received 600 mg (in four days), and 40 received 800 mg (in two days). Uterine bleeding occurred in all patients within four days of the first dose and continued for 5 to 17 days. In 85 of the women, a dramatic decrease in the plasma chorionic gonadotropin level was observed on day 6, and an empty uterus was confirmed by ultrasonography on day 13. Hence, these women were considered to have had a complete abortion. Fifteen subjects had persistently elevated plasma chorionic gonadotropin levels on day 6 and were considered not to have responded to RU 486. They all had uterine evacuation, which was facilitated by a softening of the cervix. The percentage of women with complete abortion was similar in all dosage groups. Furthermore, plasma levels of immunoreactive RU 486 were similar in subjects with and without complete abortion. The only important side effect observed in the responders was prolonged uterine bleeding in 18 percent, but neither blood transfusion nor curettage was required. We conclude that RU 486 is an effective and safe method for termination of very early pregnancy but that it should be used only under close medical supervision.",

Patients with the nondominant form of the disease had anemia ranging from severe to mild, with corresponding spectrin levels of 30 to 74 percent; their siblings were affected similarly. Distantly related homozygotes had different clinical severities with correspondingly different spectrin levels. The parents and offspring of patients with the nondominant form were clinically normal but consistently had subtle erythrocyte abnormalities. Spectrin levels in all patients were inversely related to osmotic fragility (P less than 0.0001), and they were also correlated with the clinical response to splenectomy: patients with spectrin levels above 70 percent achieved normal blood counts, those with levels of 40 to 70 percent had compensated hemolysis, and those with levels below 40 percent improved but remained anemic (P less than 0.0001).

Measurements of serum electrolytes, as well as divalent cations and the anionic contributions of serum proteins, lactate, phosphate, and serum creatinine, were made at the time of admission, after rehydration, and during convalescence. At the time of admission, the mean serum concentration of sodium was 134.8 mmol (meq) per liter, that of chloride was 103.2 mmol per liter, and that of bicarbonate was 11.4 mmol per liter; the mean anion gap was 20.2 mmol per liter. The mean serum creatinine concentration was 2.48 mg per deciliter. The low serum bicarbonate level and the high serum anion gap were corrected by rehydration. The increased serum anion gap was caused by hyperproteinemia, lactic acidemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with anionic contributions to the rise in anion gap estimated as protein, 5.5 meq per liter; lactate, 2.5 meq per liter; and phosphate, 2.5 meq per liter. The hyperproteinemia was attributed to dehydration, the lactic acidemia to shock, and the hyperphosphatemia to acidosis and transient renal failure. The mean concentrations of serum calcium and magnesium were slightly elevated but did not affect the increased anion gap. These results indicate that severe cholera causes acidosis with relatively little change in serum chloride but an increased serum anion gap. The acidosis is more profound than would be expected on the basis of stool losses of bicarbonate, because of superimposed lactic acidemia and renal failure.",

A positive association was observed between the serum cholesterol level and the risk of rectal cancer among men (P less than 0.05), with a relative risk of 1.65 in men with levels greater than or equal to 276 mg per deciliter (7.1 mmol per liter). An association was also observed between the serum beta-lipoprotein level and the risk of rectal cancer among men (P less than 0.05). When cholesterol and beta-lipoprotein levels were considered together, they were associated with both rectal and colon cancer in men. The relative risk in men with both cholesterol greater than or equal to 250 mg per deciliter (6.5 mmol per liter) and beta-lipoprotein greater than or equal to 12 units (2.2 g per liter) was 1.62 for colon cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 1.18 to 2.22) and 1.70 for rectal cancer (1.18 to 2.44). Similar trends were observed in women, although they were not statistically significant.",

Because low cholesterol levels may be a result of an established cancer, we have investigated the relation between serum cholesterol levels and the frequency of colorectal adenomas, which are thought to be precursors of colon cancer. We prospectively studied 1083 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy (241 of whom were excluded because of malignant disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, familial polyposis, or partial colectomy). In the remaining 842 patients, analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate the contribution of serum cholesterol to the risk of colorectal adenoma. Serum cholesterol levels were significantly and positively associated with the frequency of colorectal adenoma in subjects of both sexes. After adjustment for age and body-mass index, this positive association remained significant between the top quintile and the lowest quintile for serum cholesterol, with regard to the total study group (odds ratio, 2.0; 95 percent confidence limits, 1.1 and 3.6) and men only (odds ratio, 2.2; 95 percent confidence limits, 1.0 and 4.8). We conclude that there is not an inverse correlation between serum cholesterol levels and the risk of colorectal adenomas; on the contrary, there appears to be a small positive association.",

Published studies that have been based on case finding by public appeal have been characterized by difficulties in ascertainment. The data reported here are from a large population-based study of multiple sclerosis in twins, in which ascertainment has been relatively unbiased and the cooperation of patients nearly complete. A total of 5463 patients attending 10 multiple sclerosis clinics across Canada were surveyed. Twenty-seven monozygotic and 43 dizygotic twin pairs were identified, and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was verified by examination and laboratory investigation. Seven of 27 monozygotic pairs (25.9 percent) and 1 of 43 dizygotic pairs (2.3 percent) were concordant for multiple sclerosis. The concordance rate for 4582 nontwin siblings of patients at two multiple sclerosis clinics was 1.9 percent, closely paralleling the concordance rate in dizygotic twins. To the extent that the difference in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins indicates genetic susceptibility, the results of this study show a major genetic component in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.",

The study included 68 otherwise healthy patients with an identifiable source and time of infection. All 68 had diarrhea, 61 had abdominal pain, most also had other gastrointestinal symptoms, 33 had fever, and all recovered spontaneously. Among the 50 patients who submitted follow-up stool samples, more than 90 percent of the 610 symptomatic days and of the 136 oocyst-positive stools occurred between days 7 and 28 of infection, the mean incubation period was 7.2 days (range, 1 to 12), and the mean duration of illness was 12.2 days (range, 2 to 26). During the oocyst-excretion period cryptosporidium was detected in 90 percent of Ziehl-Neelsen-stained fecal concentrates. The end of oocyst excretion could be accurately determined in 26 patients; 19 (73 percent) had positive stools after the cessation of symptoms for a mean period of 6.9 days (range, 1 to 15). Fourteen patients were studied for two or more months, and in three of them asymptomatic episodes of oocyst excretion were detected up to two months after clinical recovery. We conclude that many cases of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis occur among immunocompetent patients, some of whom may excrete oocysts even when they have become asymptomatic. Conversely, infected symptomatic patients may occasionally have intermittently negative stools.",

In 1980, 89,538 U.S. registered nurses who were 34 to 59 years of age and had no history of cancer completed a previously validated dietary questionnaire designed to measure individual consumption of total fat, saturated fat, linoleic acid, and cholesterol, as well as other nutrients. In a subsample of 173 participants studied in detail, those in the highest quintile of fat intake consumed a mean of 44 percent of calories from fat, as compared with 32 percent for those in the lowest quintile. During four years of follow-up, 601 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed among the 89,538 nurses in the study. After adjustment for known determinants in multivariate analyses, the relative risk of breast cancer among women in the highest quintile of calorie-adjusted total fat intake, as compared with women in the lowest quintile, was 0.82 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.64 and 1.05). The corresponding relative risks were 0.84 (confidence limits, 0.66 and 1.08) for saturated fat, 0.88 (0.69 and 1.12) for linoleic acid, and 0.91 (0.70 and 1.18) for cholesterol intake. Similar results were found for both postmenopausal and premenopausal women. These data are based on a limited period of follow-up and do not exclude a possible influence of fat intake before adulthood or at levels lower than 30 percent of calories. They suggest, however, that a moderate reduction in fat intake by adult women is unlikely to result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of breast cancer.",

To investigate the possible role of these cells in multiple sclerosis, we used anti-2H4 antibody to characterize peripheral-blood lymphocyte subsets in 63 patients with multiple sclerosis that was progressive, stable, or acute (relapsing-remitting). Twenty-three of 37 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis had a selective decrease in the number and percentage of peripheral-blood T cells that induce suppressor cells (T4+2H4+ cells), whereas only 3 of 16 patients with stable disease and 2 of 10 patients in the midst of an acute attack had a significant decrease. These selective decreases of circulating T4+2H4+ cells occurred in only 1 of 34 patient controls with other neurologic diseases and in 2 of 50 healthy controls (P less than 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). The absolute number of T4+2H4+ cells and the percentage of reactivity in the populations studied were 187 +/- 28 per cubic millimeter and 8.3 +/- 1 percent in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis; 353 +/- 60 per cubic millimeter and 14.5 +/- 2 percent in patients with stable disease; 368 +/- 72 and 14.6 +/- 2.1 percent in patients with acute disease; 402 +/- 64 and 15.6 +/- 2 percent in controls with other neurologic diseases; and 519 +/- 44 and 19.7 +/- 1 percent in healthy controls. Functional studies using a pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG assay demonstrated a correlation between decreased numbers of T4+2H4+ cells and increased production of IgG in vitro. Family studies showed that the 2H4 antigen was not part of an inherited polymorphic antigenic determinant. Our results suggest that in progressive multiple sclerosis decreases in inducers of suppressor T cells may permit the activation of cells reactive with elements of the central nervous system.",

A multidisciplinary panel of medical experts was assembled to review the issue of skull radiography for head trauma. The panel identified two main groups of patients--those at high risk of intracranial injury and those at low risk of such injury--and developed a management strategy for imaging in the two groups. The high-risk group consists primarily of patients with severe open or closed-head injuries who have a constellation of findings that are usually clinically obvious. These patients are candidates for emergency CT scanning, neurosurgical consultation, or both. The low-risk group includes patients who are asymptomatic or who have one or more of the following: headache, dizziness, scalp hematoma, laceration, contusion, or abrasion. Radiographic imaging is not recommended for the low-risk group and should be omitted. An intermediate moderate-risk group is less well defined, and skull radiography in this group may sometimes be appropriate. A prospective study of 7035 patients with head trauma at 31 hospital emergency rooms was conducted to validate the management strategy. No intracranial injuries were discovered in any of the low-risk patients. Therefore, no intracranial injury would have been missed by excluding skull radiography for low-risk patients, according to the protocol. We conclude that use of the management strategy is safe and that it would result in a large decrease in the use of skull radiography, with concomitant reductions in unnecessary exposure to radiation and savings of millions of dollars annually.",

Much valuable information about rearrangement processes has been inferred by comparing DNA from (monoclonal) lymphoid lines with germ-line DNA and, for B cells, from rearrangements in some Abelson murine leukaemia virus-transformed cell lines. However, because it is difficult to isolate and grow precursor populations, it has not proved possible to study rearrangements occurring in normal untransformed cells in vitro. Here we show that a single T-cell precursor colonizing an alymphoid thymus lobe in organ culture can generate multiple receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements. These observations provide unequivocal evidence for the intra-thymic diversification of the T-cell repertoire. They also offer the possibility of investigating rearrangement and its control in the clonal progeny of a single normal T-cell precursor without the perturbations involved in the use of viral transformation or the production of T-cell hybridomas.",

Only minor similarity is found outside this catalytic domain, as expected for receptors that have different ligand specificities and generate different biological signals. The EGF receptor is a single polypeptide chain but the insulin receptor consists of distinct alpha and beta subunits that function as an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptor complex. Provoked by this major structural difference in two receptors that carry out parallel functions, we have designed a chimaeric receptor molecule comprising the extracellular portion of the insulin receptor joined to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the EGF receptor to investigate whether one ligand will activate the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor for the other ligand. We show here that the EGF receptor kinase domain of the chimaeric protein, expressed transiently in simian cells, is activated by insulin binding. This strongly suggests that insulin and EGF receptors employ closely related or identical mechanisms for signal transduction across the plasma membrane.",

Although exocytosis occurs in many secretory cells, these toxins show a high specificity for neurones and the secretory response of cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells is not inhibited by exposure to medium containing tetanus or botulinum toxin type A (although it is by botulinum toxin type D). Here we report that when tetanus toxin and botulinum neurotoxin type A are injected intracellularly into chromaffin cells they strongly inhibit secretion, as revealed by the measurement of cell capacitance. These results indicate that these toxins are normally ineffective in chromaffin cells because they are not bound and internalized, so do not reach their site of action. Furthermore, we have localized the secretion-blocking effects of the toxin to a fragment comprising the light chain covalently linked to part of the heavy chain, suggesting that this part of the molecule contains the active site.",

In the case of kinetoplast DNA, evidence has been presented that the DNA is curved or 'bent'. Bent DNA has previously been found at the lambda and simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication origins. Here we show the existence of bent DNA at a yeast autonomously replicating sequence (ARS1), a putative replication origin. The bent DNA has been localized to a 40-55 base pair (bp) segment and contains six (A)3-5 stretches (that is, six poly(A) stretches, three to five nucleotides in length) phased approximately every 10.5 bp. This region contains a DNA binding site for a yeast protein factor.

            "input": "Abstract: Monocular lid suture during the sensitive period early in the life of a kitten disrupts normal development of inputs from the two eyes to the visual cortex, causing a decrease in the fraction of cortical cells responding to the deprived eye. Such an ocular dominance shift has been assumed to depend on patterned visual experience, because no change in cortical physiology is produced by inequalities between the two eyes in retinal illumination or temporally modulated diffuse light stimulation. A higher-level process, involving gating signals from areas outside striate cortex, has been proposed to ensure that sustained changes in synaptic efficacy occur only in response to behaviourally significant visual inputs. To test whether such a process is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity, we treated 4-week-old kittens with visual deprivation and monocular tetrodotoxin (TTX) injections to create an imbalance in the electrical activities of the two retinas in the absence of patterned vision. After 1 week of treatment we determined the ocular dominance distribution of single units in primary visual cortex. In all kittens studied, a significant ocular dominance shift was found. In addition to this physiological change, there was an anatomical change in the lateral geniculate nucleus, where cells were larger in laminae receiving input from the more active eye. Our results indicate that patterned vision is not necessary for visual cortical plasticity, and that an imbalance in spontaneous retinal activity alone can produce a significant ocular dominance shift.",

Some clinically normal males--transmitting males--are known to carry and transmit the fragile X mutation and yet show no cytogenetic expression in lymphocytes. Normal males with no family history of X-linked mental retardation express the site only rarely. When the fragile X chromosome from affected males is isolated in a rodent genetic background by somatic cell hybridization, the level of expression is similar to that seen in lymphocytes under Td stress. Here we show that X chromosomes from two transmitting males and two normal control males, all of which were fragile X negative in lymphocytes or lymphoblasts, could be made to express the fragile site in hybrids, although at levels that were below those seen in hybrids from affected males. Furthermore, transmitting males could be differentiated from normal males by their significantly higher expression rates when hybrids were exposed to caffeine before cytogenetic harvest. One male chimpanzee also showed low level expression in hybrid cells. These data suggest that the hybrid system lowers the threshold for fragile X expression, a fragile site at Xq27 may be present on all human and chimpanzee X chromosomes and constitutes a previously unrecognized common fragile site and the hybrid system with caffeine post-treatment can distinguish between the common Xq27 fragile site of control males, the occult mutant fragile site of a transmitting male, and the fully expressed fragile site of an affected male with XLMR. Thus the mutation producing XLMR may represent a multi-step alteration of a naturally occurring DNA sequence producing a continuum of cytogenetic expression and a threshold for clinical manifestation.",

An allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) will only anneal to sequences that match it perfectly, a single mismatch being sufficient to prevent hybridization under appropriate conditions. To improve the sensitivity, specificity and simplicity of this approach, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to enzymatically amplify a specific segment of the beta-globin or HLA-DQ alpha gene in human genomic DNA before hybridization with ASOs. This in vitro amplification method, which produces a greater than 10(5)-fold increase in the amount of target sequence, permits the analysis of allelic variation with as little as 1 ng of genomic DNA and the use of a simple 'dot blot' for probe hybridization. As a further simplification, PCR amplification has been performed directly on crude cell lysates, eliminating the need for DNA purification.",

We have now produced polyclonal antibodies which specifically recognize glycine in glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue. We used these antibodies to investigate the distribution of glycine in the simple central nervous system (CNS) of the Xenopus embryo, which contains an anatomically and physiologically defined class of reciprocal inhibitory interneurones, the commissural interneurones. These interneurones have an important role in the generation of the swimming motor pattern and are thought to be glycinergic. The glycine antibodies specifically stain these interneurones, revealing their distribution and number in the embryo CNS. This is the first demonstration of the selective localization of glycine-like immunoreactivity in a putative glycinergic class of neurone that has been characterized physiologically, pharmacologically and anatomically.",

Only one other theropod specimen comprising more than a few bones had ever been found in Britain, and that discovery was more than a century ago. Indeed, no large theropod, reasonably complete, had previously been discovered in Lower Cretaceous rocks anywhere in the world. Our study so far suggests that the Surrey dinosaur was a typical large theropod in certain respects, resembling, for example Allosaurus.

One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.",

SM-FeSV does not induce haematopoietic malignancies in spite of the fact that its viral oncogene, v-fms, codes for a glycoprotein related to the receptor for the mononuclear phagocyte colony stimulating factor, CSF-1. The v-fms-coded polypeptide includes the complete extracellular domain of the c-fms proto-oncogene product and retains the ability to bind CSF-1 specifically. The two molecules have very similar sequences except at their extreme carboxyl terminal ends where 40 amino acids of the c-fms-coded glycoprotein are replaced by 11 unrelated residues in the v-fms product. Autophosphorylation of the c-fms gene product on tyrosine is enhanced by CSF-1 addition, whereas phosphorylation of the v-fms-coded glycoprotein appears to be constitutive. We now show that introduction of the v-fms gene into simian virus-40 (SV40)-immortalized, CSF-1 dependent macrophages renders them independent of CSF-1 for growth and tumourigenic in nude mice. These factor-independent cell lines express unaltered levels of the c-fms product which is down-modulated in response to either CSF-1 or the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The induction of factor independence by a non-autocrine mechanism suggests that the v-fms product is an unregulated kinase that provides growth stimulatory signals in the absence of ligand.",

Comparative studies of common seal populations from different parts of the Wadden Sea reveal that pup production has declined sharply only in the western (Dutch) part. A comparative toxicological study on the levels of heavy metals and organochlorines in tissues of seals from the western and northern parts of the Wadden Sea shows that only the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels differ significantly. This is predominantly a result of PCB pollution from the river Rhine, which mainly affects the western (Dutch) part. PCBs are thought to be responsible for the low rate of reproduction in Dutch common seals on the basis of epidemiological and experimental data on the ability of PCBs to interfere with mammalian reproduction. Here I report that reproductive failure in common seals from the Dutch Wadden Sea is related to feeding on fish from that polluted area.

In non-primate mammals, retinal fibres of this system project to a set of three nuclei: the dorsal (DTN), the lateral (LTN) and the medial (MTN) terminal nuclei. Whereas all AOS cells respond to the slow motion of large visual stimuli, the neurons are tuned to complementary directions of movement: horizontal temporo-nasal direction for the DTN, vertical up and down for the LTN and vertical down for the MTN. It has thus been suggested that these nuclei establish a system of retinal coordinates for the detection of whole field motion. As the AOS provides direct and indirect pathways to both oculomotor and vestibular structures, each of these nuclei is thought to be an essential link in the co-ordination of eye and head movements in relation to movement within the visual-field. One problem for the generalization of this theory is that the medial terminal nucleus has never been found in primates. In this report we establish both the existence of this nucleus and its afferent input from the retina in all major groups of primates (prosimians, New and Old World monkeys and apes), indicating a common anatomical plan of organization of the AOS in mammals.",

In the vertebrate visual system there is evidence that the stereotyped alignment of central retinal projections relies on an initial spatially organized distribution of molecules in both the retina and its central target nuclei. We used an immunological approach to look for molecules that are so organized and produced a monoclonal antibody (JONES) which shows a pronounced dorsal to ventral gradient of binding in the rat retina throughout the period when retinal ganglion cell axons are forming topographically organized projections within the central nervous system (CNS). Binding is present throughout the radial thickness of the retinal epithelium in regions where postmitotic neurones are generated but is not associated with any consistent histological characteristic of the tissue. The antibody was shown to bind on the cell surface of freshly dissociated retinal cells, and dorsal retinal quadrants were found in vitro to have nearly twice as much antigen as ventral retinal quadrants. Initial biochemical characterization of the target epitope reveals that it is a lipid present in chloroform/methanol extracts from perinatal retina and is sensitive to neuraminidase digestion.",

A local rise in [K+]o causes potassium ions to enter glial cells, which have membranes that are highly permeable to K+; potassium then leaves the glial cells at other locations where [K+]o has not risen. We report here the first study of the individual ion channels mediating potassium buffering by glial cells. The patch-clamp technique was employed to record single channel currents in Muller cells, the radial glia of the vertebrate retina. Those cells have 94% of their potassium conductance in an endfoot apposed to the vitreous humour, causing K+ released from active retinal neurones to be buffered preferentially to the vitreous. Recordings from patches of endfoot and cell body membrane show that a single type of inward-rectifying K+ channel mediates potassium buffering at both cell locations. The non-uniform density of K+ conductance is due to a non-uniform distribution of one type of K+ channel, rather than to the cell expressing high conductance channels at the endfoot and low conductance channels elsewhere on the cell.",

The rate of firing of these cells and the modulation of this rate by catecholamines are controlled by if, an inward Na- and K-current that turns on at voltages more negative than -40 mV. The 'pacemaker' current if is also present in other types of cell where its ability to produce and modulate a depolarizing process may be useful. For example, in vertebrate photoreceptors if drives the depolarization that terminates the light-induced hyperpolarization. Currents similar to if are also found in hippocampal neurones and DRG neurones. The present report shows for the first time that the opening of single if-channels of low conductance (1 pS) can be resolved using a modification of the patch-clamp technique on isolated SA-node cells. Modulation of if by adrenaline is shown to be mediated by an increase in the probability of channel opening, whereas the single-channel amplitude remains unchanged.",

Loss and recovery of binding capacity occurs even when protein synthesis is suppressed with cycloheximide. In view of this and similar work in other cell systems, we proposed that in cells deprived of ATP the receptor is present in a form--the 'null receptor' form, as we shall call it--that cannot bind hormone. Although many subsequent observations support this idea, no direct evidence has appeared for the existence of the null receptor. We have attempted to detect the null receptor in WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells with a monoclonal antibody to the glucocorticoid receptor. Here we report that the null receptor is bound in the nuclei of ATP-depleted cells, and is present in amounts comparable to those of receptors in normal cells.",

MHC restricted recognition of antigen by this receptor leads to the complex pattern of programmed gene expression that characterizes T-cell activation. The eventual understanding of human T-cell function will require the complete elucidation of the structure of the human T-cell antigen receptor. On human T cells, clonally determined, disulphide-linked alpha and beta chains of the receptor are non-covalently and stoichiometrically associated with three additional polypeptides known as the T3 complex. These receptor subunits are glycoproteins of relative molecular mass (Mr) 25,000 (25K) and 20K (gamma and delta) and a non-glycosylated 20K protein (epsilon). Our studies of murine T cells show that the mouse T-cell antigen receptor consists of at least seven distinct polypeptide chains. In addition to clonotypic alpha and beta chains, the murine complex consists of glycoproteins of 26K and 21K and endoglycosaminidase F (endo F)-insensitive polypeptides of 25K, 21K and 16K. The latter, which we have termed zeta (zeta), exists as a homodimer within the complex. The 26K component (gp26) has been shown to be the murine analogue of the human delta chain. Other cross species homologies remain to be established, however none of the described human receptor components appear similar to the murine zeta polypeptide. We report here the use of an antiserum raised against the murine zeta subunit to identify a previously unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen receptor. This human protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the murine zeta polypeptide.",

It is here that thymocytes with reactivities to self antigens are eliminated and those with specificities to 'altered' self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are positively selected. The selections are presumably carried out on the basis of their T-cell antigen receptors (TcR). The genes of the alpha- and beta-chain T-cell antigen receptors have been cloned. A third T-cell specific gene capable of undergoing somatic rearrangement has also been identified; the role of this third gene is not known. An order of expression of gamma, beta, then alpha is found during T-cell ontogeny. But although alpha- and beta-chain messages are often functional, gamma transcripts are rarely functional in thymocytes or mature T cells. To define the sequential order of expression of these genes further and to continue the search for a possible role for the TcR gamma gene products, we investigated the expression of 'functional' alpha-, beta- and gamma-chain transcripts in young athymic mice. These mice express an undetectable amount (less than one in 8 X 10(5) spleen messages) of 'full-length' alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor transcripts, but an increased level of expression of 'full-length' gamma chain messages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of four gamma complementary DNAs show that all four gamma transcripts sequenced are functional. These findings suggest that gamma gene products may be important in a prethymic or extrathymic pathway and may represent a second type of T-cell recognition, possibly in a lineage in which alpha and beta genes are not used.",

Differentiation was originally thought to be irreversible, but phenotypic plasticity has been observed in a variety of cell types, for example sympathetic neurones, the limb blastema and some glial cell types. A detailed description of the individual steps that lead to expression or reversal of phenotype is essential to understand the molecular events underlying cell differentiation. We examined whether ciliary neurones acquire adrenergic properties when exposed to a permissive embryonic environment. Cholinergic neurones were selectively labelled with a retrogradely transported marker and injected into chick embryos during active neural crest migration. Four to five days after injection, some of the labelled neurones were found in 'adrenergic sites' and had developed catecholamine histofluorescence. The cells had thus accumulated adrenergic neurotransmitters even after differentiation into cholinergic neurones. This result shows that neurotransmitter plasticity occurs in cholinergic neurones and suggests that the neurotransmitter phenotype can be modified by the embryonic environment.",

            "input": "Abstract: In the Drosophila embryo the establishment and specification of metameric units depends upon the selective activation of the segmentation and the homoeotic selector genes. The former are necessary for establishing the appropriate number of metameric or parasegmental units, whereas the latter control the pathways of differentiation followed by particular parasegments. Classical embryological manipulations have show n that these processes must be closely coordinated during normal development. However, previous studies of pair-rule genes have led to the suggestion that the specification of segmental identity proceeds independently of the establishment of metameres as physical units. These apparently conflicting perspectives can be reconciled by envisaging a common maternally derived positional information system which is independently interpreted by the components of both processes. In the case of the partitioning process, the gap and pair-rule genes would be instrumental in translating this information, whereas the activation of the homeotic genes would be mediated via other intermediaries (see ref. 9 for review). It is difficult to see, however, how such a system could ensure the precise regulation of the tw o types of genes implicit in the final differentiated pattern. This difficulty has led to the suggestion that the segmentation mechanism must define the precise boundaries of selector gene expression. Here we confirm this suggestion and propose that the gene fushi tarazu plays a key role in this process, integrating the processes of metameric partitioning and regional specification in the Drosophila embryo.",

After injury, the animals were randomly separated into three groups: the control group received a saline infusion for the 2-hour treatment period; the second group was given a blood transfusion over 2 hours titrated to maintain mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) at preinjury levels; and the third group received an intravenous bolus dose of naloxone (10 mg/kg), followed by a 2-hour infusion of intravenous naloxone (2 mg/kg/minute). The rats were observed postoperatively for 15 weeks, during which their clinical recovery was measured weekly by the inclined plane technique. At 15 weeks, the spinal cords were removed and prepared for histological assessment. The blood pressure before, during, and immediately after injury did not differ statistically among the three groups. During the initial 2 hours after injury, blood transfusion produced a significant increase in MSAP (P less than 0.02) and hematocrit (P less than 0.001), but naloxone infusion did not result in a significant change in MSAP. Performance on the inclined plane at 15 weeks was 35.6 +/- 6 degrees, 32.7 +/- 4 degrees, and 36.1 +/- 6 degrees for the control, transfusion, and naloxone groups, respectively, and no significant differences were found (P greater than 0.05). Histological examination confirmed a consistent injury of moderate severity in all three groups with no major differences among groups. Thus, this study demonstrates no significant clinical benefit either from a blood transfusion to maintain MSAP or from naloxone given by bolus and infusion after an extradural clip compression injury of the rat spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cell survival curves demonstrated a relative killing efficiency of 12:1 for violet compared to red light. Eighty joules of red light were required to produce 100% cell kill at an HpD concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, a level of HpD that has been quantitated in biopsies from patients receiving HpD photoradiation therapy. No difference in cellular killing efficiency was observed for power densities of red light varying from 10 to 100 mW/cm2. Cytotoxicity was directly related to O2 tension from 12 to 490 torr with a slight but consistent increase in cell kill at O2 tensions from 7 to 12 torr. Cytotoxicity was effectively quenched by beta-carotene, whereas mannitol had no effect, indicating that cytotoxicity is probably mediated via a mechanism involving singlet oxygen. This information may serve as a basis for more effective application of HpD photoradiation therapy and for designing protocols to study the efficacy of such therapy.",

No history of facial or trigeminal pain had been obtained during life in these subjects. The technique of intravascular injection, which allowed good visualization and evaluation of the neurovascular relationships, is described. A total of 42 examples of contact with the root entry zone and 10 examples of compression were identified. In 30 of the examples of contact, the finding could be related to an artery; in the other examples, it appeared to be due to veins. Of the arterial compressions, the superior cerebellar artery was responsible in 53.8%, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery was responsible in 25.6%, and pontine branches of the basilar artery were responsible for the remaining 20.6%. Only one instance of unequivocal compression by a vein was found. Other anatomical observations of interest are reported. The absence of a history of trigeminal neuralgia in the 7% of examined nerves in which root entry zone showed arterial compression is in marked contrast to the finding of 80% or more in the operative series for trigeminal neuralgia. It seems that vascular compressions may be the predominant but not the sole cause of trigeminal neuralgia.",

The computed tomography (CT) scan is considered superior to other methods used in the radiological work-up of endoorbital tumors because, in addition to being noninvasive, it gives direct visualization of the lesion and more precise localization both with respect to the muscular cone and tridimensionally. Unfortunately, preoperative diagnosis is not always possible solely on the basis of the CT scan because the enhancement of the tumor is not constant, thus making differential diagnosis with meningioma and cavernous angioma problematic. In addition, CT enables the surgeon to choose the best route for tumor removal. Operative results are good and are influenced by the use of microsurgical techniques.",

In 4 of the 10 operated hematomas, sites were regional, in five sites were adjacent, and in one the site was distant. All of the five adjacent hematomas extended downward from a lower rim of the operative locus. Causes were analyzed in the three types of the hematomas. In case of the regional hematomas, the causes were incomplete hemostasis of the dura mater or the bone in all four patients, nonperformance of central stay sutures in three, systemic hypertension in one, and hypofibrinogenemia in one. In the adjacent hematomas, we could find dural separation at an edge of craniotomy in all five patients, abrupt collapse of the brain in all, ventricular dilatation in two, and systemic hypertension during immediate postoperative period in two. In one distant hematoma, ventricular dilatation and ventricular shunting procedure were themselves thought to be the causal factors.",

In each case, computed tomography (CT) demonstrated recent cerebral infarction and cerebral arteriography showed high grade cervical carotid stenosis. No patient developed worsened neurological symptomatology, intracerebral hemorrhage, or vasomotor paralysis. These results suggest that carotid endarterectomy, if indicated, can be performed safely after acute stroke under certain conditions. These criteria include the following: normal level of consciousness, relatively small cerebral infarction without mass effect on CT, and meticulous control and monitoring of systemic blood pressure during the perioperative period. These initial observations suggest that a specific subgroup of patients with recent cerebral infarction may be able safely to undergo carotid endarterectomy shortly after diagnosis.",

A recently completed prospective randomized multicenter cooperative trial failed to confirm the hypothesis that the procedure prevents further cerebral ischemia in patients with atherosclerotic internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery disease. We analyze findings of the study in detail, including possible effects on the natural history of the disease beyond the immediate perioperative period. Potential sources of bias that may have unpredictably affected the study are discussed. These include observational bias (patient and therapist not blinded), \"randomization-to-treatment\" bias (high morbidity after randomization but before operation), and \"prerandomization\" or allocation bias (patients in the study representing a selected sample of the population with cerebrovascular disease). The extensive analysis of secondary subgroups with small numbers of patients is discussed in light of the statistical methods used. Two particular classes of patients not addressed in the study who might benefit from the procedure are defined. They are patients failing the best available medical therapy and patients with clearly documented hemodynamic compromise. Possible indications for bypass surgery are suggested for the various lesions in light of the trial and of recent reports on the natural history and pathophysiology of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Selected cases illustrating these indications are presented.",

Nine anesthetized mongrel dogs were placed on normothermic right atrial-femoral artery cardiopulmonary bypass at a flow of 100 ml/kg/minute. Local CBF measurements and CME data were collected during nonpulsatile perfusion and maximal pulsatile perfusion. The stroke model was then produced, and local CBF measurements and CME data were again collected during nonpulsatile and pulsatile perfusion. In the nonischemic brain, local CBF increased 19%, from 32 +/- 10 to 38 +/- 11 ml/100 g/minute (P less than 0.01), when perfusion was changed from nonpulsatile flow (pulse pressure less than 4mm Hg) to pulsatile flow (pulse pressure 39 +/- 11 mm Hg). In the ischemic brain, local CBF increased 55%, from 11 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 7 ml/100 g/minute (P less than 0.01), when perfusion was changed from nonpulsatile (pulse pressure less than 3 mm Hg) to pulsatile (pulse pressure 36 +/- 7) flow. EEG power data, expressed as a power ratio index (PRI = low frequency power/high frequency power), improved significantly, from 110 +/- 33 to 101 +/- 41 (P less than 0.01) with pulsatile perfusion. These data demonstrate the importance of pulsatile blood flow in ischemic brain.",

Using both interview data and mean data from the Sickness Impact Profile questionnaire, impaired quality of life was observed in the areas of psychosocial functioning, social role functioning, leisure activities, and, to a lesser extent, physical functioning, during chronic phases of recovery. Relatives and close friends reported by means of the Katz Adjustment Scale that the CHI patients showed a series of negative behavioral symptoms 2 to 4 years postinjury. These data suggest that CHI patients may experience impaired quality of life in a number of domains well beyond the acute postinjury phases. An attempt was also made to compare patients' and relatives' reports of patient quality of life. Preliminary analyses indicated modest correspondence between relatives' and patients' ratings of some areas of postinjury dysfunction, including cognitive and behavioral slowing and social withdrawal.",

The rat was selected in the development of this model in preference to larger animals for economy and availability; this permits use of large numbers of animals to increase statistical validity. In the experiments reported in this article, a static load method (weight placed gently on cord) of inducing cord injury was evaluated. A total of 198 Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Under general anesthesia, a one-level laminectomy was carried out at T-12 with the dura mater intact. Weights varying from 80 to 150 g were lowered onto the dorsal surface of the intact dura mater for durations of 0 to 300 seconds. Recovery of motor function was assessed for up to 8 weeks using two behavioral tests, a modified Tarlov scale and an inclined plane test of hind limb motor function. A statistically significant relationship was found between force of injury and motor recovery as measured by the Tarlov scale, but this did not correlate with inclined plane performance; the duration that the weight rested on the cord did not influence outcome. Pathologically, there was variation in the extent of damage for a given injury load. A semiquantitative pathological assessment of cord injury showed a statistically significant correlation between pathological score and behavioral deficit as measured by the Tarlov scale, but this did not correlate with inclined plane performance. In view of these deficiencies, the static load technique does not seem to be an ideal model for spinal cord injury research.",

The model is based on experimental data generated from an investigation of the static-load technique of inducing cord injury and was derived using multiple linear regression. The regression coefficients for weight of the injury-producing load were statistically significant (P less than 0.001), and it was found that the weight of the load contributes over 95% of the posttrauma motor deficit, whereas the time duration of the load resting on the cord contributes less than 5% to the deficit. Sex, pretrauma motor performance, and pretrauma body weight are insignificant covariates. The model may be used to establish expected motor deficits and to derive dose-response curves.",

A previous study had shown that patients with SAH and vasospasm had a significantly higher incidence of ICs in the blood than patients without vasospasm. The aim of the present study was to study how the IC content varied with time and compare this pattern with the clinical picture. Forty-two patients presented clinical or radiological signs of cerebral vasospasm during their hospital stays, whereas 12 patients showed no such signs. The patients with vasospasm had a significantly higher amount of ICs in serum than those without vasospasm. In 37 patients with vasospasm, the changes of IC content during the 1st weeks after SAH correlated well with the clinical course. Data indicated that a high IC content preceded the onset of vasospasm and a low content preceded clinical improvement. This observation supports the idea that the presence of ICs might be the cause and not the result of vasospasm.",

All patients underwent an anterior decompression and fusion via the lateral extracavity approach with or without an accompanying posterior internal stabilization procedure (modified Weiss springs or Harrington distraction rods). All patients were allowed to plateau neurologically before reconstructive spine surgery was performed. The patient's neurological grade at the time of surgery and after recovery was assessed according to a seven-grade scale presented herein. None of the 34 patients with a motor and sensory complete myelopathy recovered any function below the level in injury. Of the 10 motor-complete patients with some sensory perception, 4 improved neurologically; however, only 1 of these improved to a state of limited ambulation. The rest remained nonambulatory. Of the 33 patients with significantly disabling incomplete motor and sensory myelopathies, 17 improved to a level of minimal neurological deficit; only 3 patients were left nonambulatory. Of the 21 patients whose physical finding demonstrated a minimal neurological deficit preoperatively, 17 recovered to a normal neurological state. Seven patients were neurologically normal preoperatively and were unchanged postoperatively. Reconstruction of the spine with an anterior decompression and an accompanying stabilization procedure, when appropriate, leads to a better neurological outcome than that expected with either a conservative, nonoperative approach or an operative posterior stabilization approach.",

Permanent neurological deficits were seen with doses of cisplatin as low as 69 mg/m2, although doses as high as 100 mg/m2 were tolerated by other patients. All 3 patients who developed permanent neurological deficits received fixed doses of cisplatin of 150 mg and supplied only 2 major intracranial branches from the infused carotid artery. In none of these patients was a filter used in the infusion line. Other risk factors identified in 2 of the 3 patients were diffuse neoplasm involving the region of the internal capsule and the use of an infusion pump rather than a pulsatile bolus infusion technique. The development of a permanent neurological deficit appeared unrelated to the dose of BCNU within the range utilized, and preinfusion administration of corticosteroids did not prevent neurological deficit. These possible risk factors should be considered in the future development of protocols for arterial infusion therapy of malignant gliomas.",

The steps in the dissection consisted of first exposing the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA), the internal jugular vein, and the caudal cranial nerves, each at the skull base; then performing small retromastoid and temporal craniotomies; and, finally, drilling away the petrous and tympanic bone to expose the intratemporal parts of the facial nerve, the petrous ICA, the sigmoid sinus, and the jugular bulb. To expose the structures of the lower clivus, the sigmoid sinus was ligated and divided, the facial nerve was displaced anterosuperiorly, and the inner ear structures were preserved. Dural opening exposed the anterolateral and anterior surfaces of the medulla, the pontomedullary junction, and the spinomedullary junction. The ipsilateral vertebral artery and often the contralateral vertebral artery and the vertebrobasilar junction, the caudal cranial nerves, and the origin of the 6th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves were well exposed. To expose the structures of the middle clivus, we drilled away the labyrinth, the cochlea, and a portion of the clival bone. The facial nerve was displaced posteroinferiorly. Dural opening exposed the ipsilateral anterior surface of the pons, the midbasilar artery, and the ipsilateral 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves. A portion of the contralateral anterior surface of the pons was also exposed at times. The superior limit of this exposure was just above the origin of the trigeminal nerve. The exposure of the upper clival structures was limited with this approach, and required medial temporal lobe retraction. Two case reports are included to illustrate the application of the transtemporal approach to the exposure and clipping of aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed.",

Criteria for the determination of brain death have been progressively refined for almost 30 years. They involve clinical evidence of the loss of brain function and various periods of observation, which can often be shortened by confirmatory tests, particularly cerebral blood flow studies or electroencephalography. Prompt declaration of brain death is therefore possible. In addition, it is important for physicians to offer the possibility of organ donation to the patient's family both because organs are desperately needed and because many families desire this. A model algorithm for the determination of brain death, explanatory text, and appropriate references are presented to aid the development of protocols for individual and hospital use.",

We report clinical and electrophysiologic studies of nervous system involvement in a 25-year-old student who abused nitrous oxide. He developed signs of a sensorimotor polyneuropathy and of myelopathy. Routine blood studies, CSF examination, and myelogram were normal. Clinical electrophysiologic studies were performed serially. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated reduced amplitude and slowed sensory potentials, and mildly prolonged late responses. Sensory evoked potentials revealed prolonged latency of scalp-evoked potentials from tibial nerve stimulation with normal median nerve values. The foveal visual evoked potential was delayed in the right eye, with normal visual acuity, funduscopic examination, and spatial contrast sensitivity. Repeat electrophysiologic studies demonstrated improvement. Nitrous oxide produces multifocal reversible dysfunction within the nervous system similar to that described in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.",

Fifty-three of the 59 patients randomized to radiation therapy received a 4500- to 5000-rad tumor dose in five to 6.5 weeks bilaterally to the groins and to the midplane of the pelvis even if only unilateral positive groin nodes had been detected; no radiation was given to the central vulvar area. Fifty-three of the 55 patients randomized to further surgery had pelvic node resection performed on the side containing positive groin nodes either unilaterally or bilaterally. Acute and chronic morbidity was similar for both regimens. The two major poor prognostic factors were clinically suspicious or fixed ulcerated groin nodes and two or more positive groin nodes. The difference in survival for the 114 evaluable patients was significant, favoring the adjunctive radiation therapy group (P = .03). The estimated two-year survival rates were 68% for the radiation therapy group and 54% for pelvic node resection group. The most dramatic survival advantage for radiation therapy was in patients who had either of the two major poor prognostic factors present; at this time, the benefit of radiation therapy for the remaining patients is uncertain. In this randomized prospective study, the addition of adjunctive groin and pelvic irradiation therapy after radical vulvectomy and inguinal lymphadenectomy proved superior to pelvic node resection.",

Seven of these ten patients exhibited the clinical characteristics of Stein-Leventhal syndrome; of these, three had evidence of polycystic ovaries. Nine of the tumors were well-differentiated, adenoacanthomas (six) or adenocarcinomas (three) and limited to the endometrium. In one case, a moderately differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma involved an ovary and the pelvic wall. Treatment consisted of curettage and progestogens in three patients, one of whom later bore two children. The remainder of the women were treated with abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and/or radiation therapy. All patients for whom follow-up data are available are alive and well without evidence of disease. It is concluded that in selected young patients with well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma limited to the endometrium, conservative hormonal therapy and curettage may be adequate treatment and may preserve fertility.",

Patients with stage I and II disease whose tumors contained elevated levels of cytosol progestin receptors had an improved survival over patients with tumors containing low levels of cytosol progestin receptors. However, patients with advanced ovarian cancers and low cytosol progestin receptors had significantly longer survival. The four-year estimated duration of survival with advanced disease and cytosol progestin receptors less than seven was 82%, whereas if the cytosol progestin receptors were seven or more, the four-year estimated duration of survival was only 10%. The explanation for this dichotomy is not evident at this time. In this study cytosol estrogen receptor levels were not associated with survival. These results suggest that measurement of cytosol progestin receptors is of prognostic value in advanced epithelial ovarian cancers.",

This study was designed to assess whether daily ambulatory home monitoring of uterine activity could facilitate early diagnosis of preterm labor. Of 76 patients at high risk for preterm labor who used daily ambulatory tocodynamometry, approximately half developed preterm labor. Evaluation when the diagnosis of preterm labor was first established has shown that in 8% of the patients the cervix was dilated more than 2 cm, shortened to less than 0.5 cm in 23%, and the fetal membranes were intact in all subjects. The same evaluation in 76 nonrandom contemporary controls matched for risk factors, maternal age, and parity has shown that more than 50% had a cervix dilated more than 2 cm, 38% had a cervix shorter than 0.5 cm, and 24% had rupture of the fetal membranes. Ultimately, 88% of the monitored patients and 59% of controls delivered at term.

Data from 210,947 Washington state birth certificates from 1980 through 1982 were examined. The incidence was 50.2 cases of Erb's palsy per 100,000 live births. A case control study design was used to analyze 106 cases and 386 controls by both univariable and multivariable analysis. Birth weight was shown to be a significant risk factor regardless of which method of delivery was used. A high birth weight infant (4001-4500 g) had 2.5 times the risk of incurring an upper brachial plexus injury compared with normal size infants (2501-4000 g). The risk for infants greater than 4500 g increased another tenfold (OR = 21.0). When birth weight was controlled for in the analysis, midforceps (OR = 18.3), vacuum extraction (OR = 17.2), and low forceps (OR = 3.7) remained significantly associated with the Erb's palsy. Delivery by cesarean section was associated with a significant protective effect (OR = 0.5) compared with instrumental vaginal delivery.

In six women with ovarian vein involvement and no evidence of iliofemoral thrombophlebitis, resolution followed intravenous antimicrobial therapy alone, and in three of these, resolution was confirmed by x-ray tomography. In contrast, three of five women with symptomatic iliofemoral thrombophlebitis had a prolonged febrile course despite antimicrobial and heparin therapy. The clinical courses of these 11 women were consistent with the observation that pelvic thrombophlebitis is associated with pelvic infection. Disease manifested within a few days after parturition was more likely due to ovarian vein involvement, whereas disease with later onset of symptoms was more likely due to iliofemoral thrombosis, with or without vena caval extension. Through the use of x-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the natural course of pelvic thrombophlebitis can be better elucidated and therapeutic regimens more clearly evaluated.",

Only one of 109 cases reviewed gave a history of birth by cesarean section, whereas ten cesarean deliveries would have been the expected number for this group on the basis of national rates. The single case was delivered by elective cesarean section before the rupture of the membranes, and the child developed respiratory papillomatosis in the first year of life. These findings suggest that in juvenile-onset disease, the transmission of infection from mother to child occurs most often during passage through an infected birth canal, but that intrauterine infection of the fetus is also possible. Papillomavirus infection of the female genital tract is common, but respiratory papillomatosis is rare. On the basis of crude estimates of annual number of children born to infected mothers and of new cases of juvenile-onset disease, the risk of developing disease for a child born to an infected mother was calculated to be one in several hundred exposures.",

The admission test was done in a concealed manner, and the result of the test was evaluated after delivery so as not to influence the clinical management. In part I of the investigation, the test was performed in 130 patients monitored during labor with pH determinations in scalp blood and in cord blood at birth. Patients with reactive admission tests had a low rate of intrauterine asphyxia in labor (0.9%), whereas half of the patients with ominous traces had intrauterine fetal asphyxia with a low scalp blood pH and neonatal depression. Similar results were obtained in part II, when the admission test was used as a screening procedure involving 1041 patients. The test was reactive in 94.3%, and in this group fetal distress (cesarean section, or forceps on that indication, or an Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes) occurred in 1.3%. Ten patients (1.0%) had ominous tests; four of these had fetal distress, and one of these fetuses died in utero three hours after admission, during which time stethoscopic auscultation failed to detect the fetal compromise. It is concluded that the admission test can detect fetal distress already present at admission and unnecessary delay in intervention can be avoided in such a case. The test seems also to have some predictive value for the fetal well-being for the next few hours of labor. The test is simple and convenient for screening purposes.",

Alterations in colloid osmotic pressure in preeclamptic patients, as well as significant peripartum changes in colloid osmotic pressure in normotensive patients, are reported. In a study of 72 normotensive and preeclamptic patients, peripartum colloid osmotic pressure, serum albumin, and total serum protein were compared. Both groups exhibited significantly lower colloid osmotic pressure in the postpartum period than that measured antepartum. The mean antepartum colloid osmotic pressure in preeclamptic patients was significantly lower than in normotensive subjects. Regression equations were calculated [colloid osmotic pressure = 5.21 (total serum protein) -11.4 (r2 = 0.851)] and [colloid osmotic pressure = 8.1 (serum albumin) -8.2 (r2 = 0.891)]. Within the physiologic ranges most commonly reported for normotensive and preeclamptic patients, the use of these equations allowed calculation of colloid osmotic pressure to within 10% of measured values in 75 and 80% of the cases, respectively. Where direct measurement of colloid osmotic pressure is not readily available, calculated values may be helpful in patient management.",

This study was designed to determine the mechanism for decrease in target organ sensitivity by examining pregnancy-induced changes in the affinity and number of angiotensin II receptors in myometrium from pregnant and nonpregnant sheep. Tissues were obtained from four ovariectomized sheep given 50 micrograms estradiol-17 beta on days 3 and 5 postsurgery and from four pregnant sheep (mean gestational age 136 days). Binding of 125I-angiotensin II was determined in particulate fractions of myometrium prepared by differential centrifugation. The 125I-angiotensin II binding to myometrial preparations was specific, saturable, and linear with protein concentration. In the nonpregnant group, binding capacity for angiotensin II in myometrium was 502 +/- 76 fmol/mg protein, whereas in the pregnant group it was 184 +/- 65 fmol/mg protein (P less than .01). Receptor affinity also was less (Kd 1.72 +/- 0.39 nM) during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant sheep uterus (3.9 +/- 0.80 nM; P less than .01). These data support the hypothesis that the decrease in target organ sensitivity to exogenously administered angiotensin II during pregnancy in human and ovine species may be secondary to a decrease in the total number and affinity of specific angiotensin II receptors.",

In 29% of the cases, one or more false-negative cytology reports preceded conization. No dysplastic cells were found on review of the false-negative cytology slides from these cases. Morphometric analysis of surface dysplasia in the conization specimens was performed to explain these findings. A statistically significantly greater surface area of dysplasia and greater spread of dysplastic cells in the endocervical canal was found in the positive cytology when compared to the false-negative cytology cases. No difference in vaginal spread of dysplasia existed between the two groups. The endocervical canal was sampled with a moist cotton swab in all of the cases. The results suggest that small numbers of dysplastic cells high in the endocervical canal may not be effectively sampled by cotton swabs in cases of false-negative cervical cytology, lowering screening sensitivity.",

These hypotheses were evaluated in a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 521 patients under age 45 with breast cancer were compared with 521 controls matched for age, time of interview, and geographic area. Oral contraceptive use before the first birth was reported by 155 patients and 137 controls. With allowance for confounding by multivariate analysis, the estimated relative risk was 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.5). The estimate was 1.0 (0.2-3.9) for any use among nulliparous women and 0.6 (0.3-1.3) for use before the first birth among parous women. Use before age 25 was reported by 145 patients and 141 controls, and the multivariate relative risk estimate was 1.0 (0.7-1.6); the results were similar when use of specific formulations was examined. For oral contraceptive use before either the first birth or age 25, the relative risk estimates were compatible with 1.0 for use of five or more years' duration or an interval since first use of at least 15 years. There was also no evidence of an increased risk in any subgroup including those at increased underlying risk because of factors such as a family history of breast cancer or a history of cystic breast disease. The findings suggest that, up to age 45, the risk of breast cancer is not influenced by the use of oral contraceptives before the first birth or before age 25 even if the use lasted for five or more years.",

Their size and pressure amplitude have been measured at various laser-pulse energies. With a pulse energy of 5 mJ, the bubble is 1.5 to 2.3 mm in diameter and the pressure of the acoustic transient is 9 to 16 bar (130 to 230 psi) at a distance of 18 mm from the focal point. Bubble size and amplitude of the pressure pulse are always approximately 50% higher with a Q-switched laser than with a mode-locked laser. However, the size of the ruptures produced in a polyethylene membrane by the laser pulses is the same for both modes of operation.

A stalk of fibrovascular tissue was noted to extend from the lesion to the optic disc. Histopathologically, the tumor was a well-circumscribed, pigmented ciliary body adenoma. Electron microscopy revealed characteristic neuroepithelial melanosomes, distinct from those of choroidal melanocytes, and occasional annulate lamellae. A fibrovascular membrane extended over the tumor surface and was adherent to lens capsule. The association of this adenoma with a persistent stalk of primary vitreous indicates a congenital origin of this tumor. Both adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelium tend to be disorders of adults.

The specimen studied four days after injection revealed by light microscopy scattered pigment granules within the epidermis and fine granules and small aggregates dispersed within the dermis. No acute or chronic inflammatory cells were observed in relationship to the deposits. The specimen obtained 12 months after eyeliner injection was studied by both light and electron microscopy. No pigment particles were observed within the epidermis, but rather there were coarse clumps of granular material in the dermis. Apart from scattered mast cells, which occasionally contained fine granules, and apart from the macrophages which appeared to have ingested the pigment granules, no other acute and chronic inflammatory cells were found. Electron microscopy demonstrated that while most of the granular material had been phagocytosed by macrophages, occasional granules were found in small dispersions within the cytoplasm of mast cells and fibroblasts of the dermis. Minimal migration of pigment within macrophages occurred to locations around lymphatic channels and within the superficial orbicularis muscle connective tissue.",

Although several scales are currently used to assess the intensity construct, it remains unclear which of these provides the most precise, replicable, and predictively valid measure. Five criteria for judging intensity scales have been considered in previous research: ease of administration of scoring; relative rates of incorrect responding; sensitivity as defined by the number of available response categories; sensitivity as defined by statistical power; and the magnitude of the relationship between each scale and a linear combination of pain intensity indices. In order to judge commonly used pain intensity measures, 75 chronic pain patients were asked to rate 4 kinds of pain (present, least, most, and average) using 6 scales. The utility and validity of the scales was judged using the criteria listed above. The results indicate that, for the present sample, the scales yield similar results in terms of the number of subjects who respond correctly to them and their predictive validity. However, when considering the remaining 3 criteria, the 101-point numerical rating scale appears to be the most practical index.",

One of two tricyclic antidepressants (either amitriptyline, a relatively selective serotonin uptake inhibitor or desipramine, a relatively selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor) or a placebo, was given for 1 week prior to surgery, followed by a single postoperative dose of morphine. Desipramine, but not amitriptyline, both increased and prolonged morphine analgesia. Neither tricyclic antidepressant reduced dental postoperative pain in the absence of morphine. We propose that desipramine enhances opiate analgesia by enhancing a noradrenergic component that contributes to endogenous opioid-mediated analgesia systems.",

While some data suggest a similar increase in pain thresholds for pregnant women, Goolkasian and Rimer have found, using signal detection procedures, that women are increasingly likely to report stimuli as painful during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy. The present studies were carried out to assess pain and discomfort thresholds in the last weeks of women's pregnancies. In the first study, daily measures of the pressure-induced pain thresholds of 6 women who had spontaneous, vaginal births increased during the last 16 days of pregnancy and exceeded the 300 mm Hg maximum stimulus pressure for the last 9 days of pregnancy. In the second study, the discomfort thresholds of 6 women were measured each day during the last 11 days of pregnancy before spontaneous vaginal births. The discomfort thresholds of the pregnant women were higher than those of 6 non-pregnant women whose discomfort thresholds were also measured each day. Pregnant women's thresholds increased before the onset of labor, while the discomfort thresholds of the non-pregnant women were unchanged during the course of the study. These results extend Gintzler's findings of reduced sensitivity to pain shortly before parturition.",

Pain prevalence and severity, and its impact on work and other activities were obtained and correlated with demographic variables. This paper reports the portion of the study examining the association of pain with stress, daily hassles, measures of health locus of control, and various health habits. There was a very strong association between stress and pain and hassles and pain. The greater the stress and hassles, the greater the incidence, frequency and severity of all pains reported. Those with high internal health locus of control are more likely to have healthy behavior, are less likely to have all kinds of pain, and have less severe pain. Stress was voluntarily mentioned by respondents as a major cause of pain in headaches, backaches, stomach pains, and menstrual pains, but not for muscle, joint or dental pains.",

Intravenous administration of fentanyl (100 or 200 micrograms/kg, 0.179 or 0.358 mumol/kg) also showed a similar lack of effect on the radiant heat evoked responses of single PMNs. Slight changes in the mean latencies following drug administration were recognized, which were not statistically significant. The use of morphine (1.5%, 1 ml, 19.8 mumol) with preservatives (chlorbutanol 0.5% and sodium bisulfite less than 0.1%) caused conduction block of PMNs within 6-15 min. Subsequent washout of the drug resulted in the return of the unitary discharges within 8 min. Lidocaine (0.25 and 0.5%, 10.7 mumol and 21.4 mumol) caused conduction block within 5-18 min.

Properly time amniotic fluid analysis for alpha-fetoprotein is both a sensitive and specific test for neural tube defects. However, because of the low incidence of spina bifida cystica, this examination is justified only in high-risk pregnancies. Maternal serum screening has not achieved widespread acceptance because of its lack of sensitivity and the low and apparently falling incidence of the deformity. The neonatal manual examination for congenital dislocation of the hip is now well established and widely practiced. Almost all agree that the incidence of persistent congenital dislocation of the hip has been lowered as a result. However, the examination lacks both sensitivity and specificity because of intrinsic difficulties with the examination and the occurrence of late onset subluxation and dislocation. It is becoming apparent that congenital dislocation of the hip is a dynamic problem in the peri- and early neonatal period. Repeated careful evaluation of the hips during infancy is necessary to make the diagnosis as early as possible. To further enhance early detection, it may be necessary to consider obtaining an anteroposterior pelvis radiograph at age 4 to 6 months in babies at high risk. The visual evaluation for scoliosis is a very sensitive test but lacks specificity. Efforts are now being made to quantify visual screening techniques and thus decrease the numbers of false-positive examinations.",

Many infantile foot deformities, such as calcaneovalgus, are postural and self-correcting. Metatarsus varus is not referred for treatment until age 2 months and then only if the deformity is moderate or severe. Fixed forefoot equinus and heel varus characterize a clubfoot, which requires immediate treatment. Corrective shoes are not advised as the primary treatment for metatarsus varus or clubfoot but often are prescribed to maintain the corrected position after serial casts. Flexible flatfoot is a manifestation of a constitutional laxity affecting all ligaments and joints. The feet appear abnormal because of weight-bearing stresses. Most children with flatfoot achieve a partial correction spontaneously. Current research does not document that treatment with corrective shoes or inserts produces a result better than the partial correction that occurs naturally.",

It is most commonly seen as the infant commences ambulation. This so-called physiologic bowing usually spontaneously resolves with growth and the maturity of the lower extremities. In older children, tibia varum may occur, in which there is a local arrest of growth on the posterior medial aspect of the tibia producing a true structural angulation. In certain long-standing metabolic or genetic bone disorders, the effects of weight bearing produce a true bowing of the extremities with changes about the hips, knees, and ankles. The most important aspect in the evaluation of a child with a bowed appearance of the lower extremities is to determine which conditions require aggressive treatment and which ones require simply giving the parents reassurance that the condition will spontaneously regress.",

These models have used the serum creatinine level as either a reciprocal or logarithmic plot against time. The accuracy of such predictions are characterized by either a correlation coefficient (r value) or prediction error (time at which dialysis was predicted minus time at which dialysis actually occurred). Retrospectively, we analyzed 37 children who progressed to end-stage renal disease, grouped them by their respective primary diseases, and calculated both r values and prediction error for each individual and group. Although r values for each group (with the exception of patients less than 1 year of age) were comparable, prediction errors were widely disparate among the various groupings. Individuals within each of the groups had disparate values even though identical r values were present. These observations indicate that predictive models using serum creatinine levels are of limited clinical use and are least useful for patients younger than 1 year of age.",

The screening device, administered between 3 and 7 months of age, is based on the infant's differential fixation \"to novel\" over previously shown pictures. The sample was composed of 62 infants suspected to be at risk for later mental retardation. The prevalence of delayed cognitive development (IQ less than or equal to 70) at 3 years of age was 13%. Novelty preference scores correctly identified six of eight (75%) of the delayed children. The test identified 49 of 54 (91%) of the normal children. Validity for predicting cognitive delay was 55%. Validity for the prediction of normality was 96%. The screening device proved to be equally sensitive, specific, and valid when the sample was divided into infants born at term or born preterm. The results of the present study and of a previous study indicate that detection of cognitive delay based on early novelty preferences is as easily accomplished for infants who will later be mildly delayed (IQ scores 60 to 70) as it is for those who will later be severely delayed (IQ scores less than or equal to 50). Moreover, such results are in contrast to those obtained with conventional tests tapping sensorimotor development.",

This study investigated the use of toluidine blue dye in the pediatric (0 to 10 years) and adolescent (11 to 18 years) patients to detect posterior fourchette lacerations in sexually abused and control populations. Application of toluidine blue dye increased the detection rate of posterior fourchette lacerations from 4% (1/25) to 28% (7/25) (P less than .05, Fisher exact test) in adolescent sexually abused patients and from 16.5% (4/24) to 33% (8/24) (P = .318, Fisher exact test) in pediatric sexually abused patients. Posterior fourchette lacerations occurred with the same frequency in sexually abused adolescents and sexually active controls adolescents. In the pediatric aged population, 33% of the sexually abused group had lacerations detected, whereas none of the control patients had lacerations. The presence of posterior fourchette lacerations in the pediatric aged patient is strongly suggestive of sexual abuse. Toluidine blue increases the detection of posterior fourchette lacerations in children and adolescents (P less than .001, Fisher exact test). The application of toluidine blue dye to highlight posterior fourchette lacerations is an important addition to tools already used in the evaluation of the sexually abused patient.",

One of the children suddenly died at the age of 16 months following an episode of a rapidly deteriorating Reye syndrome-like illness with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and dicarboxylic aciduria, but without any previous alarming symptoms. The eldest sibling had died at the age of 19 months under similar conditions. The other family members had always been healthy. On fasting, all affected family members accumulated in their plasma the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic, decanoic, and cis-4-decenoic acids. Their urinary organic acid excretion profile could be characterized as \"dicarboxylic aciduria.\" A deficiency of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase was demonstrated in a postmortem liver sample of the index patient. Cultured fibroblasts from the father and the two healthy children had a decreased rate of [14C]octanoate oxidation. It is suggested that a deficiency of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase may lead to a life-threatening illness when other complicating factors such as diarrhea and vomiting result in an abnormal depletion of the body's glycogen stores. Careful monitoring of at-risk patients during a minor illness is necessary.",

Virtually, all live-born infants (14,724) born between October 1977 and December 1983 in the city of Malmo, Sweden, were included in the study. Special attention was given to the role of congenital infections, particularly to cytomegalovirus infection. The infant population was studied from two points of view. One part of the study was prospective and based on regular cytomegalovirus isolation in urine within the first week of life. About 80% of the newborns were adequately studied by this test. None of 56 infants shown to be cytomegalovirus excreters (congenitally infected) and followed up were born with or developed microcephaly (head circumference smaller than 3 SD below the mean for age and sex) during the first 1 to 7 years of life. However, two of the 56 infants had a head circumference of -2 SD. In the beginning of 1985, an inventory was made of the presence of symptomatic microcephaly in the above mentioned population still living in the city or deceased there. Of about 10,000 such children, 12 were found to have symptomatic microcephaly. By studies of personal, clinical, and laboratory data and by retrospective serologic studies of frozen pre- and postconceptional maternal sera, a possible explanation or a recognized syndrome was obtained in ten of the 12 cases. In one of them, the mother had a primary cytomegalovirus infection, possibly in early pregnancy. Although the infant had symptoms compatible with a congenital infection, no laboratory evidence of transmitted infection was found. In no case were congenital rubella virus or Toxoplasma gondii infections suspected.",

Each child was screened using the DDST (revised) and another screening measure of speech and language development. Statistically significant differences were found between the DDST language sector and the speech-language screening in identification of expressive language and articulation problems. No significant difference was found with receptive language. The DDST failed to identify more than one half of the children with expressive language and/or articulation problems. These results demonstrate that the DDST may fail to identify children with speech and language impairment.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this law, we analyzed traffic accident data for New Mexico from January 1981 through September 1984. During this period, there were 20,972 children younger than 5 years of age in motor vehicle accidents. Restraint usage increased for this age group from a low of about 10% in 1981 to more than 40% in 1984 (P less than 10(-6)). Unrestrained children younger than 5 years of age were five times more likely to be killed and two times more likely to be injured than restrained children. Analysis of motor vehicle accident fatality and injury rates pre- and post-law revealed a 33% reduction in motor vehicle accident fatality rates and a 12.6% reduction in nonfatal injury rates for children younger than 5 years. We conclude that child restraint devices are effective in reducing motor vehicle accident fatalities and injuries in young children and the child restraint law has been effective in increasing child restraint usage and in reducing childhood death and injury in New Mexico.",

There were no statistical differences between the control and study groups in patient characteristics (age and sex) and product characteristics (general class, emetic potential, pretreatment, previously opened bottles, and manufacturer). In both control and study groups, emesis occurred in 100% of cases with 90% of patients vomiting with the first dose.

To test this hypothesis, we developed for preterm newborns a behavior observation method that catalogues specific reaction patterns according to putative stress and relaxation behaviors. We then collected behavioral information and heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous PO2 readings before, during, and after routine care-giving interventions. Eight control and eight experimental infants were selected for study based on the following criteria: birth weight less than 1,250 g, gestational age less than 28 weeks, on the respirator greater than 24 hours in first 48 hours of life at greater than or equal to 0.60 FiO2 for more than two hours during first 48 hours of life. Additionally, the two groups were comparable on other medical and demographic variables, including severity of respiratory status for the first ten days and incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and socioeconomic status. Systematic observations were conducted on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth and at 36 and 40 weeks postconception. For the intervention infants, our observations were discussed with the infants' primary nurses, and individualized modifications for each infant's care plan were implemented based on these observations. Experimental infants showed significantly briefer stays on the respirator (P less than .01) and in increased FiO2 (P less than .05). Their feeding behavior was normalized significantly earlier (P less than .01). Experimental infants also showed significantly better behavioral regulation scores at 1 month after their mothers' estimated dates of confinement (post-EDC), as measured with the Assessment of Preterm Infants' Behavior, significantly better Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Indices at 3, 6, and 9 months post-EDC, as measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and significantly better behavioral regulation scores at 9 months post-EDC, as measured in a videotaped play observation. Measurements of weight, height, and head circumference at 3, 6, and 9 months post-EDC showed no differences. All assessments were performed by one of two trained testers not familiar with the goals of the study or the group status of the infant. These results support the hypothesis that very low birth weight preterm babies profit significantly both medically and developmentally from individualized behavioral care in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

To further differentiate the effects of asthma itself from the drugs used, we evaluated 20 asthmatic children (6 to 12 years of age) who had not received oral bronchodilators for at least 6 months. A double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel format was used with a 4-week theophylline or placebo period preceded by a 2-week baseline. Theophylline serum levels were maintained between 10 to 20 micrograms/mL. During baseline and treatment periods, the child's home and school behavior/performance were monitored independently by their parents and teachers using standardized report forms. A battery of psychologic tests was administered at the end of baseline and treatment periods. Seven children receiving theophylline were noted to have a change in school behavior and/or performance during their 4 weeks on drug compared to baseline, whereas none of the children receiving placebo were noted to be different (P = .004). Thus, the short-term administration of theophylline to asymptomatic asthmatic children not receiving oral bronchodilators can adversely affect school performance and behavior. Because this population represents the majority of asthmatic children, one needs to use theophylline cautiously in this age group, monitor school performance closely, or seek other treatment modalities.",

Except for mortality data by cause and age, which are based on a 10% sample, all the US data for 1984 are estimates by place of occurrence, based upon a count of certificates received in state offices between two dates, 1 month apart, regardless of when the event occurred. Experience has shown that for the country as a whole the estimates, with few exceptions, are close to the subsequent final figures. There are, however, considerable variations in some states, particularly in comparing data by place of occurrence and place of residence. State information should be interpreted cautiously.",

There were 92,495 emergency department visits recorded in this interval. During 12 months of this period (July 1983 to June 1984) a pilot program (Citicare) for AFDC recipients requiring prior authorization by the primary care physician for emergency department utilization was in effect. Emergency department census dropped dramatically and abruptly upon initiation of this program. Annual census for the targeted years reveals: 35,704 visits for the 12 months preceding this novel program, 25,543 visits for the 12 months of the program, and 31,248 visits for the 12 months following the pilot program. Total emergency department census was decreased by 23% and medical assistance utilization was decreased by 46% during the Citicare program. During the target period, self-pay clients decreased by 25%, and other categories (Champus, Hill-Burton, Crippled Children's Commission, etc.) increased by 6%. There was no corresponding decline in the number of patients admitted to the hospital through the emergency department during the monitoring period with 3,545, 3,555, and 3,922 annualized admissions respectively, for the targeted 12-month periods. These data suggest that the format of Medicaid programs can dramatically alter the utilization of emergency department services. Furthermore, the primary impact of this specific program was to decrease inappropriate emergency department use.",

In addition to patient-specific factors such as patient age, size, and weight, and venous size, number, and character, there exist further universal limitations inherent in the equipment which is utilized. Mechanical variables include cannula number, length, brand, and gauge; tubing length, band, style, and gauge; use of extensions; and presence and type of pressure system. This study evaluated a few of these variables. The flow rates were determined for 10 brands of 20-, 22-, and 24-gauge peripheral intravenous catheters. The catheter brands were divided into two groups, slow or faster. The differences in flow between the two categories were statistically significant. The disparities between the slowest and most rapid catheters of the same gauge were only 6.6, 5.4, and 7.7 ml/min for the 20, 22, and 24 gauges, respectively. The tubing apparatus was also a significant determinant of flow. The addition of any extensions further decreased flow. The magnitude of this slowing was a function of both the tubing and the type of extension.",

Emergency department records of children diagnosed as being sexually abused were reviewed for the period covering January 1984 through June 1985. Of 26,000 patients seen, 300 cases of sexual abuse were identified. Of these, 57 were patients who presented with initial complaints other than sexual abuse. The data were analyzed for age, sex, chief complaint, time of presentation, physical findings, and person accompanying the child. The most common presenting complaints of these 57 patients were abdominal pain (26%) and vaginal symptoms (26%) The latter included pruritus, discharge, and bleeding. Other complaints included rectal bleeding or constipation (9%), chronic urinary tract infection (5%), straddle injury (4%), and suicide attempt (2%). The remaining 26% included fever, respiratory infections, sore throat, asthma, bronchitis, obesity, mastoiditis, and weight loss. Because resident physicians are instructed to conduct complete anal and genital examinations on all patients, sexual misuse was often diagnosed with seemingly unrelated complaints.

Proper collection and storage techniques, careful donor selection, and laboratory screening of donor blood for evidence of syphilis, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection form the basis for prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections. Viral hepatitis, notably non-A non-B hepatitis, is the most frequent infectious risk of transfusion in the United States today. The risk of HIV infection is very low because of voluntary donor self-deferral and screening of donated blood for evidence of the infection.",

The shoulder mechanism provides the upper limb with a range of motion exceeding that of any other joint mechanism. The placement of the hand is determined by four components of the shoulder complex: the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic gliding mechanism. The clavicular joints permit the scapula to move against the chest wall during movements of the arm, allowing the glenoid fossa to follow the head of the humerus, and thus contribute significantly to total arm movement. The functional interrelationships between the glenohumeral, scapulothoracic, and clavicular joint mechanisms are critical in providing a full, functional ROM. Any pathological condition of any one of these mechanisms will disturb upper limb function. The ligamentous and periarticular structures of the shoulder complex combine in maintaining the joint relationships, withstanding the forces applied to the joint surfaces, and stabilizing the dependent limb.",

A minimum follow-up period of 6 months was required for inclusion in this patient group. Maxillary movements included advancements (17), intrusions (9), lengthenings (5), and retrusions (2). The majority of maxillae were moved in more than one plane of space. Technical details, complications, and relapse potential are discussed. Advantages of rigid plate fixation include marked reductions in the length of intermaxillary fixation with light training elastics only. Immediate postoperative airway problems are thereby eliminated. Six months of follow-up would appear to indicate a low potential for osseous relapse when compared to wire osteosynthesis, regardless of the direction of maxillary movement. The major disadvantage is the decreased ability of postoperative orthodontics to move dento-osseous segments if skeletal occlusal disharmony persists postoperatively. For this reason, close attention to preoperative planning and operative technique is critical for the success of this fixation method.",

In 30 percent of vessels, histopathologic damage extended more than 3.0 cm from the rupture point. Similar circumferential tears occurred on the luminal surface of resected human avulsed arteries collected at the time of replantation surgery. No consistent lesions were noted in resected veins from human avulsed amputations. It is possible that in the human artery (as in the monkey) circumferential lesions frequently extend many centimeters from the rupture point and therefore beyond resection distances.
