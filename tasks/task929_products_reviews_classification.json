If you've decided to write your own story, then please, go ahead, but stop with the literary devices. That's the thing in my opinion. It is not a bad idea for most writers now, when they do their first draft, just to try things. But that doesn't mean to ignore these things in writing.",

I found it lacking in depth - but then, I'm neither an astrophysicist nor mathematician. It was nonetheless very interesting to read and get some idea of what goes into making AI successful. Of course, playing games are required for this. After all, we don't expect robots controlling robotic drones to play chess either. Even so, it's a great reference work which should help anyone who wants to further their understanding beyond games.",

So, my calves get very hot during these workouts. Not sure how they would do with larger ones. They feel like walking on sandpaper. If you have normal size calves, then this review wouldn't apply. But as it is, after wearing them once only for a 15 minute bike ride, i had blister lines. Also, no cushion whatsoever.",

Dre and Eminem take on issues that most would not want to discuss in everyday life such as; race, death, poverty, violence, sexual abuse etc. What I found fascinating about Dre's lyrics was how he made you question your own opinions as well as put himself into the role of both listener and antagonist.",

The first pair I wore on a daily basis got very scratched up. They now look fairly bad. So take my review for what it is. For regular use, these would be fine. However, if you need super durable sun glasses, go ahead and spend more because you'll probably end up getting scratches in them pretty quickly. Also, this is the second time I'm writing a bad review for an Amazon product.",

When compared with what else there is, that is, say, Michael Landon's The Mummy series, or any number of other films, we can draw some conclusions on these points.",

The characters were not what you would expect from an Amish book. They weren't very loving in their marriage or that they treated each other terribly. In fact, I don't think there was any love involved at all. So unless your idea of a good read includes sex, it probably shouldn't be considered good. The language in general felt out of place. It didn't feel right.",

The padding isn't as soft or cushy feeling as you'd expect, but there's enough there that if you sit on one side hard, you'll get some relief. It's not so rigid from top to bottom as to cause your shoulders to feel like they would explode.",
