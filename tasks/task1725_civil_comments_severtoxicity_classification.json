The forecast out to 2020 is the same rate of decline as we saw under ACES. For the first time in our history we are paying more in subsidies to the tune of Hundreds of Millions of Dollars than we get back in oil production tax revenues.

I live in nice, relatively quiet part of town, yet I see the moms take their kids to the school bus stop and sit there watching over them until they get on the bus.   Most don't ride the bus at all and there is a long, long line of \"mommy-mobiles\" dropping off or picking up kids at the nearby school.   I almost never see a kid playing outside.
