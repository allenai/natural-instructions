The forecast out to 2020 is the same rate of decline as we saw under ACES. For the first time in our history we are paying more in subsidies to the tune of Hundreds of Millions of Dollars than we get back in oil production tax revenues.

We had guns all over the house, used them to hunt food for our table, used them for target practice, and you'd better damned well believe they would have been used against someone coming into our home.  However, I was taught to respect the damage a gun can do if used incorrectly. That you never point a gun at another human unless you intend to take a life. This education came from my lifelong NRA card carrying stepfather. He, too, believed police should receive more training in their use of deadly force-the proper and improper times to use it, and how widely it is abused now.",
