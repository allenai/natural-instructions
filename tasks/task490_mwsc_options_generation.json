        "You are given a sentence and a question, construct 2 answer options in a specific format i.e. ['option1','option2']. The answer options have to be text spans from the given sentence. Only one among the options should be the correct answer to the given question. Note that, the correct answer to the given question will require understanding of coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities."
