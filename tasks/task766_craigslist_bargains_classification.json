        "Given a text passage as input consisting of dialogues of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, the task is to classify the text into one of the labels from the two possible outputs - 'accepted'/'rejected'. Select [accepted] if by the end of the conversation the buyer seems likely to buy the item from the seller. A sale is likely made when the buyer and seller agree upon a common price or when a deal is made between them. Select [rejected] if the buyer did not seem interested in buying the item from the seller at the end of the conversation. This happens when the buyer and seller do not agree on the price or other aspects of the item being sold by the seller."

Would you accept 100 for the board?\nSeller: No, that offer is too low. The board is pretty much brand new as it's been ridden only 4 or 5 times.  The bone bearings are brand new.\nBuyer: If I picked it up at your location would you accpet 120?\nSeller: Make it 150 and we got a deal. \nBuyer: I could do 145, if you can gurantee the painting on the front of the board is not scratched up. \nSeller: Deal\nBuyer: Great!",

That will buy a lot of diapers.\nSeller: I need the SUV. That is just way too low for me. Sorry you need to come way up.\nBuyer: I can do 20,000 if you throw in a 3 year warranty to cover any repairs that might naturally arise\nSeller: There is a warranty in place, so that is not a problem.

            "explanation": "This answer 'yes' is incorrect here because it is not among the only two options 'accepted' or 'rejected' from which the answer is to be chosen. The correct answer is 'rejected' because the buyer and the seller are not able to agree upon the same price as seen in the conversation where the buyer is offering 1850 but the seller will not sell for under 2000 and so the seller rejects the buyer's offer. This indicates that the buyer does not end up buying the item from the seller."

What's wrong with it?\nSeller: Absolutely nothing is wrong with it the bike is fully comprised of high end components that are clearly listed in the description i am firm on 700.\nBuyer: Honestly bikes don't cost 700 dollars. I need you to come down to about $200, and that's a lot for a used bike. If you haven't noticed, the bike market isn't exactly booming,\nSeller: I wouldn't go near that low the low end bike market may not be booming but this is a high end bike.\nSeller: \n"

You are welcome to schedule an appointment to get it checked or take it for a test drive.\nBuyer: That would be perfect! Would you take $2500 for it?\nSeller: No nothing near that low for a car this nice it only has 60000 miles on it and is in beautiful condition.\nBuyer: It is almost 8 years old and only has 60000 miles??? Did you ever drive it? How about $3000\nSeller: My commute is only 5 miles and no that is less tham half my offer.\nBuyer: Alright then half of your offer $3500\nSeller: No i;m afraid you will have to look elsewhere the lowest I'll go is 6000.\nBuyer: At 8 years old the depreciation is 80% from it's original price as well as parts normally wear out between 8 to 10 years so although you may have a beautiful car it will begin to fall apart soon. $6000 is too much for an 8 year old car. I can go $3750\nSeller: \n"

How big are the units?\nSeller: They are approximately 565 sq. ft. Very reasonable for the area, very reasonable indeed. We are fairly close to the hills too, so they are much larger than you would find closer towards the water. Let me ask before I give you an offer, we are also adding a discount for those who have Equal Housing Opportunity vouchers. Do you have a voucher?\nBuyer: Are you kidding me? Over $2000 a month for a box that's less than 600 sq ft? And in Fremont? This isn't exactly downtown San Francisco we're talking about. For a unit that small I can't really do more than $1300 a month. I mean does the place come with maid service and free breakfast in the mornings?\nSeller: Excellent, excellent. So no voucher. No I am not kidding you gentle person. I understand it is not San Francisco, but this is SF style and an excellent move towards the city. We only have the finest residents. We do a full background check, security. Everything an upscale person as yourself would want. We will give you a 10% discount because of your FICO score. Plus you get $500 when you move in! Don't forget about that!!\nBuyer: It's not worth the $2130, even with a one time discount of $500 dollars. You're going to have to give me a much better price than that.\nBuyer: \n"

Any dents, scratches or dings? and why is the picture only showing the back of the phone?\nSeller: I just didn't take a picture of the other side for some reason, but it is in excellent condition as it had always had the case and screen protector. It is not unlocked.\nBuyer: Awesome. I like the color as well. I see you are asking $320 but would you be willing to go as low as $288? I am really on a tight budget at this time. \nSeller: I could do $295 and throw in the case and screen protector.\nBuyer: Oh with case and screen protector? That's a great deal. Sold!

Kind of on a budget at the moment. wondering what the lowest you would take would be.\nSeller: The lowest I would be willing to go on the antique solid wood set would be an even $600, and at that price it would be Pick Up Only.    Original asking price was listed at $750, and the piece was picked up at an antique store for just shy of $2,000\nSeller: \nBuyer: I underestand. But the value cant be near it anymore as you and i are currently talking about it at a fraction of the price. Im also interested in picking up the sofa i saw on the other listing as well. Would you consider 450 on the dresser, and if the sofa is in good condition, ill offer you the listing of $200. 2 for 1 deal.\nSeller: I can toss in the sofa for an additional $50   (as opposed to asking price listed at $90)  and deliver all of the items directly to you saving you a bit of gas and time for an even $700?    :) \nBuyer: Deal!\nBuyer: \n"
