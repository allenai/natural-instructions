Then, the burden of proof was on Catherine, and the operative word is \"proof\". Catherine's unsupported word should not have sufficed, and at the time she made this claim, she was not a virgin. Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.\n\nHowever, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost. Pope Clement VII did not want a re-run of that war, so he stalled by taking Catherine's claim seriously. There were special commissions and so on to waste time.",

AT might have taken out his cell phone and called the police. Instead, he escalated, endangering both himself and the drunk guy. Let sleeping dogs lie. Don't be a self-appointed vigilante.

It is so sad that there are still people today who want to paint Merton as a heretic or some sort of person at odds with the teachings of the church.  Richard Rohr, OFM, whom I see as a modern day Merton, speaks so clearly about our inability to believe we are loved unconditionally by God, and therefore set up all sorts of limitations to God's grace, believing ourselves to be somehow  unworthy of God's love or thinking we have to earn it.\nThe last of my cancer patients, to whom I have been ministering, went joyously Home to the Kingdom's Feast, and it was my privilege to be with them as their journeys ended.

Therefore the author of the Constitutions calls it a heathenish practice to ordain women priests,….for the Christian law allowed no such custom.  Some heretics, indeed, as Tertullian (Constit. Apost. Lib. Iii, c. 9) observes, allowed women to teach and exercise and administer baptism; but all this, he says, was against the rule (Tertul. De Praescript. C. 41) of the Apostles” (Ibid).\"",

This demonstrates that it is not food that is bad (or particular foods), but the hurtful words from our hearts. Similarly, it is not firearms that are bad, but the way some people may use them to hurt innocent people. Are AR-15s bad in the hands of police who use them to stop a terrorist in Dallas, or is it the terrorist himself who is using one to kill police while they protect Black Lives Matter demonstrators?

Imagine if the SCC were to hear and rule on an appeal application about a pipeline in northern Canada after deselecting intervenors representing aboriginal interests. It just wouldn't happen. And it shouldn't happen, just as it shouldn't in a case where LGBTQ interests as well as the legitimate right of LGBTQ citizens/residents to be protected from discrimination are at stake. This is not about special interests. It's about the right of people from a historically oppressed community to be able to protect themselves from discrimination.

Sweden's biggest challenge will be how they handle the upcoming liberal-muslim conflict over Sweden's traditional liberal agenda, or, the inevitable Muslim male pressure to formally adopt Sharia Law after years of surreptiously running it without government approval.

Look at Qatar and other \"moderate\" muslim countries like Kuwait and the UAE ....... how do they treat gays, women, and religious minorities? They all support fundamentalist islam. Yet they all escape criticism from the government. Freeland is comfortable criticizing Russia for its many abuses, but compared to our pretend allies in the Middle East, Russia is a liberal paradise.\n\nWhy the double standard?",

A few years ago, I rode the Washington DC Metro for the first time and I said, \"Wow!\"  I kept thinking how wonderful it would have been if we had something like that for my Hawaii Kai commute.  I wish everyone could experience these metro systems.  They are clean, on time, safe, comfortable, and reasonably priced and quiet.  Much of the DC metro is underground, but the Oahu Rail will be above ground, so yes, you will have your quiet moments to reflect on part of the island and neighborhoods.

The first is that women are inferior to men (\"since it is not possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a woman is in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the sacrament of Orders\"). The second is that the tonsure is inappropriate for women.\n\nNow they say that the inferiority of women is not an acceptable argument, while still hanging on to it, using words such as \"complementarity\" and \"ontological differences\".

I have regrets for that period of my life.   Truthfully, I wished I had waited.  Not due to shame so much for the sex but more I wish I had been strong enough with God that I didn't let the hurt pull me so far away from His Holy Spirit.  I don't think God demands we seek sex in marriage only for reproduction as Christ never gives this reason and even St. Paul never recommends people marry to have children at all but instead so they (both men and women) don't fall into sin due to some of them not being able to handle a life without sex.

Nipping and tucking, body as property to please to be defined by the trumpians we encounter? More women die of heart disease than breast cancer but which do we fear more? So again I say with freedom comes personal responsibility. That means not doing unto ourselves what we fought to escape from having done to us. We fought for the vote -- and then don't vote. We find it easier to chatter about Roe v. Wade, than personal responsibility and accountability for defining the limitations that are celebrations of both freedom and responsibility.\nYes, we've come a long way baby, but not quite far enough. So single issue voting is an excuse for not wanting to accept responsibility for the full weight of the freedom to vote.",

In reality, chastity is the proper way of living out one's sexuality which takes different particular forms according to different vocations. In marriage having intercourse with one's spouse happens within the context of chastity, but this is obviously no so in religious life. Whether or not they have sex, all priests, religious, married, and single people experience sexuality in their own way.",

These are all reasonable options, but they didn't satisfy America's lust for retaliation.\n\nThe American invasion of Afghanistan was not authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Hence it violated international law. Neither was the invasion justified by modern standards comparing similar events. Example: the UK didn't invade Ireland because of the IRA, despite a hundred years of bombings and terrorism. And finally, it wasn't justified on humanitarian grounds.

Over 40 Indian Villages were destroyed in an act of revenge, and the Mohawks were then forced to flee to Canada for safety.\n\nThe Mohawks were never an admirable symbol or worthy of being the school's mascot, as many of stood against the creation of the United States.   They made themselves an enemy of our country, by siding with the British.\n\nIt is good that the Mohawk name is being removed from the school.

He did not yell out praise for Jesus as he killed. He was motivated by anger against the US government in areas such as gun ownership rights and US law enforcement against gun owners.\n\nMarc Lepine was not a Christian fundamentalist. He did not yell out praise for Jesus as he killed. He was motivated by anger and hatred against feminists and women, having been raised in a home where, routinely, his Muslim father violently beat his mother.\n\nAlexandre Bissonnette was not a Christian fundamentalist.

He has money and people think that will rub off on them? White supremacy that captures the imagination of more idiots parading around in their KKK robes? The unemployed who kid themselves into thinking the orange haired guy cares whether they feed their families?  People claiming 'change' as motivation when they really mean destroy everything the alt right doesn't like?  The Russian puppet-leader will not be allowed to remove women's rights as if we are at worst slaves and at best window dressing. If you want to see angry women just stay tuned as this disaster unfolds.",

The reasons for this can often be attributed (overall) to racist policies in the past. On top of that, just because the government cannot have racist laws does not mean people in the government cannot be racist.

Expecting such individuals to identify their background is not it's not desirable.

My hypothesis there was that the current western epidemic of sexual attraction/identification disorders currently results in large part from the irrational belief that men and women are to all intents and purposes identical.  It's not instructive to equate western-style “gay” homosexuality with animal behaviour.  Simply because a behaviour can be found, commonly or rarely, among animals does not make it moral (that’s not what ‘natural law’ means).

We deal with this without divising a specific strategy for a specific group. As I said from the outset mandating behaviour towards a specific religion, is not I believe the goal of this committee. If it is, it will change before it ever is finalized.",

Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was \"ekklesia,\" which means \"gathering\" and which came to be understood as the \"place of gathering.\" Its Jewish predecessor was the synagogue (essentially same meaning).",

What exactly was Jesus asking of his Father? If you read to the end of the chapter, the answer is clearly stated: \"...that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\" (The New Oxford Annotated Bible, v 26)\n\nThe unity Jesus seeks of his followers is primarily a unity in love, not doctrine. I don't deny the importance of doctrine, but I do deny that it has supreme importance. Belief in (intellectual assent to) the dogma of the Eucharist cannot redeem a person: only Eucharistic love, manifested in and through word and deed, can do this.

Gore lost and the street fighters won. So it has been ever since. \n\nWhenever Republicans can find a loophole to circumvent the law, procedure, precedent, whatever it takes to win, they take it, and the people who vote for them register their approval by reelecting them. That means that if our democracy is being whittled away by the present Republican-controlled Congress it is because their constituents in their gerrymandered districts have allowed it. Something tells me that when the full implications of their actions dawn on them down the line they'll regret having supported people who violated two centuries of convention for short-term political gain.

Mrs. Clinton has said \"She doesn't remember,\" and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims. The Middle East is aflame today because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, threatening the security of the US and our allies.

True, there are some gay wags who say they love practicing their homosexuality, because \"practice makes perfect,\" but that's something else.\n\nWhat the objection of conservative Christian authorities to \"the practice of homosexuality\" sounds like is no less than that they wish all LGBTQI people would stay secure and gagged in their closets, forever.

The right likes to raise the specter of communism all the time as a straw man argument to denounce all progressive thought. This isn't reality any more than it would be to claim the entire right is an extension of white supremacist thinking. Such binary thinking isn't actually useful nor intellectually honest. \n\nAnd why aren't communists stigmatized just as much as confederates? Maybe because I can't think of a single violent action of anyone claiming to be a communist happening in America. Meanwhile, confederates literally once started the Civil War, the most violent and pervasive embrace of domestic terrorism we have ever experienced. And their continued influence for a century latter suppressed, intimidated, and killed black people. And even today, their hate, violence, and terrorism is on display. There is no comparison.",

Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103.

It was written by Felix Marquardt, a Muslim who lives in Paris.\n\n\"There is a common thread between despicable acts of violence committed around the world these days. And that common thread is that the people who commit them think of themselves as Muslims. In other words, no, there is no intrinsic \"problem\" with Islam, but yes, hell yes, there is a contemporary degenerescence of our religion that is threatening its very existence and future. If we, as Muslims, cannot agree on this, then we must brace ourselves, for Islam will disintegrate completely before our eyes in the coming years. To address a problem, one must first admit that there is a problem.\"",

In my post, I specifically reference that many of these alleged rapes and sexual assualts involve \"date\" or \"acquaintance\" actions.  There are seldom wittnesses (not a big surprise).  The \"rape kits\" are usually irrelevant since the defense is almost always \"yes, we had sex....but it was consensual.\"  You need to remember the schools have NO CHOICE but to launch a \"genuine\" investigation of their own.  It's required by Title IX. Your final sentence \"....matter for the justice system, not academic institutions\" is not true.",

Semi-automatic weapons may not be used in warfare today but weapons like the AR-15 and more specifically high-capacity magazines constitute war-like weapons that mass murderers and terrorists have used to create war-like slaughters in areas frequented by civilians in the U.S.  \nWhile the distinction between the weapons for some firearm connoisseurs might be vitally important  (a semiautomatic weapon fires one shot every time the trigger is pulled while an automatic weapon fires continually until the trigger is released) it is likely less compelling to the non-connoisseur who cannot but observe obvious 'war-like' conditions occurring in civilian spaces in the US.

A restriction or ban on small household appliances would make us safer.\"\n\nSo everyone getting hysterical about the attack in Quebec City should calm down, it doesn't mean Muslims are \"under attack\" by \"white males\"?

A cat once came to my country home in a state of starvation. I managed to feed it and save its life. However, I have also had a female cat that kept producing more and more batches of kittens. It was impossible to provide for them all. I placed the unwanted kittens in a gunny sack containing a stone, tied up the sack, and placed it in a pond so that the kittens would drown. It was a painless death. In another case, to avoid offspring, I shot and killed our mother cat. Often such methods prevent unnecessary suffering of animals. I also shoot and kill porcupines whenever I can. When our dogs go after them, the porcupines slap their tails at the dogs, and the dogs come home with hurtful quills. When we pull out these quills, the dogs suffer considerable pain. Mercy killing is often the best solution to save animals from pain.",

Personal opinion is not a good basis for moral or dogmatic teachings.\n\nIt can be invoked when the person does not have an actual argument. A good example is in Humanae Vitae 4, which says essentially \"we know the natural law, and you will just have to take our word for it\". That's not an argument, that's blather.\n\nWhen it does not actually describe how nature works. Humanae Vitae says that in nature, sexual intercourse is used for procreation.

I am sorry but I disagree with you on the principle of \"corporate judgement for corporate sin\". On the Last Day each individual, in this case each individual bishop will be called to account for his deeds before Christ; the College of Bishops will not be judged corporately. For this reason I don't think that \"corporate sin\" exists at all. Each of us has the choice of collaborating with others in doing evil or of not collaborating. Whether we join with them or not is entirely an individual decision as we are in possession of free will. I don't believe that there such a thing as corporate will.\nThat is the main basis of my thinking.\nContinued ....",

I understand that the Koine Greek word \"porneia\" is debated, but I read an intriguing argument for its being translated as \"adultery\" - in the sense of secretive sexual intercourse with a man other than the woman's husband - as the more accurate term. This is based on the fact that in the Septuagint translation, the word \"porneia\" is often used in a phrase alongside another Greek word, \"moixeia\", to translate OT Hebrew phrases in which both words, in each context, refer to such manner of adultery.",

I mean, does he have a special dice he rolls on his desk, where one roll of the dice might reveal \"make it 50% women\" and another that says \"make it 90 percent women\" and another that says \"make it merit-based\"?",

Instead of a winner-take-all approach, which, as you say, can result in all the power given to the most populous states, it would mean more to make sure every political party that represents us finds a seat at the table.  One of the biggest mistakes our Founding Fathers made was to reject a parliamentary form of government.  In their rush to declare independence, they experimented with a different kind of democracy.

Studies indicate that 20% of all white people have used multiple kinds of illegal drugs, compared to 10% of all blacks and Latinos. Whites use more methamphetamines, hallucinogens, OxyContin and cocaine than other ethnic groups. Black people, however, are arrested at three times the rate that whites are for drugs. On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.",

On the other hand...YES, it's very plausible that people might have sexual desires regarding their non-familial co-workers and, therefore, may invite them out for a drink with the inhibited desires to engage in \"taboo\" sex with their co-worker. That happens over and over in countless work environments across around the world. Where have you been?\n\nThe whole purpose of having those drinks is to \"loosen up,\" after all.

When residents of reserves do not directly pay for services there is no incentive for the band management  or Indian affairs to respond to problems and the residents cannot hold back payment and force the band to provide better service. The other problem is that many communities are not sustainable and depend on outside resources to survive. The whole concept of a reserve is racist and will probably not work long term, calling them first nations is just double speak. Do not expect things to improve because there is an industry keeping things the way they are and in the end it will be the people who live on reserves who solve their problems or not.

Our Monsignor and pastor at our Parish Father Kevin stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from our parish St Elizabeth and used the money at the casinos.

But with this freedom there seems to be an attitude. Or is it my first experience of a person expressing there rights as they see them as they have seen them exercised by other groups. I think there may be a danger to do just that. I say this because I have done the same thing in my life after I was an abused teenager. I grew up to become just like the two people that had charge over me. To my horror. Then spend the next forty years trying to become the person I thought I would become. Having to undo much of who I had become. I hope you understand what I am getting at. I am not biased but concerned. Thanks.",

That is not what happened.  A small number (in the overall context) of people were apparently killed by chemicals.  Use of CW to cause this small pocket of deaths provided negligible military advantage but did provide dramatic effect, a high probability dramatic effect, of opening direct conflict between the Syrian government and the US.  In the end, Assad cannot survive US involvement; therefore, out of his self interest, he would not use CW.  The rebels win big through their use.",

My family contains beliefs on both ends, which led to a total ban of religious discussion at any gathering.  Like other humble thinkers, I feel my strong spiritual belief is my own business, between me and my creator.  Just keeping myself humble and contemplative is a full-time occupation, let alone judging someone else's piety.  Why do some here have such a chip on their shoulder about religion?

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.  It certainly doesn't mean someone from an equatorial climate couldn't successfully enter the more technological environment.

Few jurisdictions...none that I know of..share your perspective.  You refer to women who take grevious offense at unwanted touching (groping) as whinners and suggest such groping is \"inconsequential.\"  You really seem to suggest that women should just be \"better sports\" about receiving unwanted sexual advances (short of rape, of course) and not get so (to use your phrase) \"pissed off\" about it.
