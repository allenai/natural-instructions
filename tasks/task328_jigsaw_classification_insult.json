Then, the burden of proof was on Catherine, and the operative word is \"proof\". Catherine's unsupported word should not have sufficed, and at the time she made this claim, she was not a virgin. Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.\n\nHowever, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost. Pope Clement VII did not want a re-run of that war, so he stalled by taking Catherine's claim seriously. There were special commissions and so on to waste time.",

You can ban the companies product from being imported into the United States.  Do you think that the State Health Department can call the Philippine Government and tell them to shut Sea Port down.  Not a chance.  Hopefully, somebody got to Sea Port and informed them.\nExample.  a drug dealer makes cocaine in Bolivia, traffics it to Los Angles, taken to New Jersey and somebody dies from an overdose.  Where do you go?",

Sexual abuse, like any abuse is also a function of highly inequitable power.

I discovered him as a fifteen year old the year Vatican II ended, and I came into the church the following year. He was the first of some wonderful mentors on my spiritual journey. It is so sad that there are still people today who want to paint Merton as a heretic or some sort of person at odds with the teachings of the church.  Richard Rohr, OFM, whom I see as a modern day Merton, speaks so clearly about our inability to believe we are loved unconditionally by God, and therefore set up all sorts of limitations to God's grace, believing ourselves to be somehow  unworthy of God's love or thinking we have to earn it.\nThe last of my cancer patients, to whom I have been ministering, went joyously Home to the Kingdom's Feast, and it was my privilege to be with them as their journeys ended.  God is good, all the time...all the time, God is good.",

Therefore the author of the Constitutions calls it a heathenish practice to ordain women priests,….for the Christian law allowed no such custom.  Some heretics, indeed, as Tertullian (Constit. Apost. Lib. Iii, c. 9) observes, allowed women to teach and exercise and administer baptism; but all this, he says, was against the rule (Tertul. De Praescript. C. 41) of the Apostles” (Ibid).\"",

This demonstrates that it is not food that is bad (or particular foods), but the hurtful words from our hearts. Similarly, it is not firearms that are bad, but the way some people may use them to hurt innocent people. Are AR-15s bad in the hands of police who use them to stop a terrorist in Dallas, or is it the terrorist himself who is using one to kill police while they protect Black Lives Matter demonstrators? God hates evil actions and thoughts, not inanimate objects. And the law being broken is one made by our clueless legislators, not one made by God.

But please don't be another pro-gay person who gets upset when somebody brings up something negative about being homosexuality. In this case, it was a person who stopped being gay - which is the worst thing that can happen to the pro-gay movement, right? That's what I've noticed about the pro-gay movement the past 10 years. Pro-gays demand all the rights and privileges but deny any accountability. Part of the accountability is acknowledging there are people who don't agree with homosexuality. In summer 2012, a gay Nebraska woman called the cops and said she was assaulted in her home because she was gay. Investigation showed the injuries were self-inflicted. Pro-gay people in the area were asked about the incident and they said very, very little, because they knew the woman hurt their image. Remember, good, honest Christians have to live with troubling Focus on the Family actions.",

And it shouldn't happen, just as it shouldn't in a case where LGBTQ interests as well as the legitimate right of LGBTQ citizens/residents to be protected from discrimination are at stake.

Muslims coming to Sweden almost immediately get on welfare, continue to work the system with multiple wives collecting while having children, and they remain there as they have zero skills, but more importantly, they aren't interested in learning skills - their husbands don't want them to learn anything. Sweden's biggest challenge will be how they handle the upcoming liberal-muslim conflict over Sweden's traditional liberal agenda, or, the inevitable Muslim male pressure to formally adopt Sharia Law after years of surreptiously running it without government approval.

My cousin applied for and was accepted for the Deaconate program in our diocese.  After about 3 months, he received a call from someone telling him he was rejected from the program.  They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.

Rather the challenge is to the hetero to \"judge not lest you be judged\" and to \"love your neighbor (all men, everyone, as told in the Good Samaritan) as you love yourself\". We are never told by Christ to love only those who are just like us.\nThe folks in Twelve Step recovery groups offer the idea of \"spiritual progress, not spiritual perfection\" similar to that which is taught in the parable of the Prodigal Son.

To be fare Obama was more than happy to sign that one. \n\nPro-life reps, love to cut the social safety net, which hurts children the most because a lot of aid goes to single mothers.\n\nLet's face it \"pro-life\" is really just \"punish women for having sex.\"",

When the natives you speak of organized to overthrow the US-backed dictators, they were crushed with the full support of the US. One needn't look as far back as Ronnie Reagan and his support of the Contra death squads in Nicaragua or his support of the genocidal dictator Rios Montt in Guatemala to see the affects.\n\nIt seems you support the overthrow of the democratically-elected leaders in Central America in support of foreign commercial interests.

The first is that women are inferior to men (\"since it is not possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a woman is in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the sacrament of Orders\"). The second is that the tonsure is inappropriate for women.\n\nNow they say that the inferiority of women is not an acceptable argument, while still hanging on to it, using words such as \"complementarity\" and \"ontological differences\".

Being a Christian has always been the best way but one which has always been filled with persecution and it always will be.

I have regrets for that period of my life.   Truthfully, I wished I had waited.  Not due to shame so much for the sex but more I wish I had been strong enough with God that I didn't let the hurt pull me so far away from His Holy Spirit.  I don't think God demands we seek sex in marriage only for reproduction as Christ never gives this reason and even St. Paul never recommends people marry to have children at all but instead so they (both men and women) don't fall into sin due to some of them not being able to handle a life without sex.

What do they do when the way in which they bring that news doesn't work, when neither the words nor the rituals which should evoke love doesn't work?  ...when huge numbers of \"believers\" don't believe every thing but aren't free to discuss their disagreements?  \n\nI think many of those who aren't participating simply don't find Jesus there, don't believe some of what is taught is really what Jesus would say, don't find spiritual growth.  \n\nPray, pay, obey doesn't work any more.  So, it is time for the Church to seek what does work, not to hold onto a past that has stopped working.",

In reality, chastity is the proper way of living out one's sexuality which takes different particular forms according to different vocations. In marriage having intercourse with one's spouse happens within the context of chastity, but this is obviously no so in religious life.

These are all reasonable options, but they didn't satisfy America's lust for retaliation.\n\nThe American invasion of Afghanistan was not authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Hence it violated international law. Neither was the invasion justified by modern standards comparing similar events. Example: the UK didn't invade Ireland because of the IRA, despite a hundred years of bombings and terrorism. And finally, it wasn't justified on humanitarian grounds.

If there is no booze present, Canadians are more often introverted or reflective.  With a beer in hand, both genders ease into that sex-is-possible banter not allowed any other time. Coors and Molson beers ads notwithstanding, this cultural bottleneck should be fixed . . . .  women's safety would be enhanced as a result.",

It's a whole different proposition, and has the advantage of your version of being non-inflammatory and an example of begging the question.\n\n\"Burke\" does not have a problem, the Church does. The two synods concluded in agreement with the cardinal. It's Footnote 351 of the Exhortation that appears to have headed off to LaLaLand in interpretation.\n\nAs Hungarian Cardinal Peter Erdö said frankly during the Synods, it all just comes down to a choice: either you give a certain group of people Communion or you don’t.\n\nWe await Francis\" rebuttal, clarification, cough, whatever.\n\nHow familiar are you with this Pontiff's career prior to his elevation to the papacy?

This was a huge step forward, though there have been civil rights cases brought forward. I am assume we both understand this and agree.\n\nWhat this means though is that black families, before the civil rights movement, were the victims of racist policies and business practices. The impact of this still has effects today.\n\nSo when someone says \"black people are poor because of their own choices\" that misses the bigger picture. The reasons for this can often be attributed (overall) to racist policies in the past. On top of that, just because the government cannot have racist laws does not mean people in the government cannot be racist. Which is at the heart of the police brutality issue. \n\nTo tie this back to the main point: white privilege means you don't have the burden of current and past racism to deal with. Rich or poor.",

Exposing one's identify and interest in a given topic or opinion stifles free expression.  For example, state employees have valuable insights on stories on government corruption, but don't want to identify themselves for fear of retribution. Expecting such individuals to identify their background is not it's not desirable. In reading the comments sections, I believe this dynamic occurs more often then people might think with lawyers and police officers commenting about the criminal justice system, doctors and nurses adding their opinions about health care issues, etc... Clearly if their opinions are flattering to those in power, identity would not be a problem, but criticism would be.

A trans person who recently had surgery done, and is going to need more surgeries, or if they are going to need psychological treatment - I think those should be taken into consideration before allowing them to join or not.

My hypothesis there was that the current western epidemic of sexual attraction/identification disorders currently results in large part from the irrational belief that men and women are to all intents and purposes identical.  It's not instructive to equate western-style “gay” homosexuality with animal behaviour.  Simply because a behaviour can be found, commonly or rarely, among animals does not make it moral (that’s not what ‘natural law’ means).   Many species kill their own kind with abandon, but that does not mean that humans should emulate them.",

It was like inviting someone to your house only to slam the door in their face.\n\nAs for immigrants/refugees/visitors from those countries under the travel ban, it was more akin to not inviting someone over in the first place.  You're under no obligation to invite people in the house, especially if there are murderers hiding within their midst - better to give financial aid.\n\nIt should be added that Muslim refugees from Syria are safely (though sadly not comfortably) ensconced in camps in Turkey and Jordan, and can return when the civil war ends (as they are part of the majority group).  Religious minorities like Christians and especially Yazidis are not so fortunate - nor do many particularly want to return to a country where they were subject to genocide.\n\nCanada, incidentally, has yet to give refuge to a large number of Yazidis.",

It's just not worth it.\n\nTrucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.\n\nConcurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them.",

Two weeks later, a second flyer mentioned Clinton by name and claimed she was under the influence of Satan. “Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell.”",

Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was \"ekklesia,\" which means \"gathering\" and which came to be understood as the \"place of gathering.\" Its Jewish predecessor was the synagogue (essentially same meaning).",

Since you made the sentence an exclamation, I presume that you, like me, recognize just how pivotal is the petition to (and how definitional of) any genuine claim to be Jesus' disciple. What exactly was Jesus asking of his Father? If you read to the end of the chapter, the answer is clearly stated: \"...that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\" (The New Oxford Annotated Bible, v 26)\n\nThe unity Jesus seeks of his followers is primarily a unity in love, not doctrine. I don't deny the importance of doctrine, but I do deny that it has supreme importance. Belief in (intellectual assent to) the dogma of the Eucharist cannot redeem a person: only Eucharistic love, manifested in and through word and deed, can do this. Note, however, that intellectual assent to Eucharistic dogma is not a condition for exercising the love referenced by the dogma.",

There's clearly a point in weak or failing government that makes room for a strong armed leader that promises they can fix things if they just trust in them.     It sells, the frustration with indecision slows.   But in the long run, the price for calm, become stifling censorship, reduced creativity, less innovation and eventually, well, Korea.\n\nIt's important to know how leadership styles can effect human behaviors.  Gerson is pointing out 'central control' does not embrace the creative energy of a more open society.\n\nA voice against authoritarian control, and support for functional alliances that discourage suppression and encourages cooperation, what's not to like?",

Furthermore, since most of the dinosaur fossils were rapidly buried in the Flood, it is an inescapable conclusion that man and dinosaurs existed together, regardless of whether or not they were created or hybridized.

Maybe then there would be an investigation and family placement. In my sons case they took the child and had her in fostercare within an hour. No contact with family happened for 3 days. They are suppose to contact the family immediately, before foster homes, and try to keep the family together. Hmmmm no money in that scenario...There is suppose to be a committee of 5 to oversee OCS, that's a federal law. Alaska does not have one.

It has been reported that his girlfriend is the senior lobbyist for the Airlines For America (A4A), an anti-consumer airline trade group that colludes to maximize industry profits.

Very bad for general aviation, which would assume a large burden of the system taxes they would certainly shift away from themselves.

It does not apply where a curate is told about the abuse of his parish priest, but vice versa it does. It does not apply where a bishop walks into a priest’s bedroom and finds him abusing a child. His knowledge come from his own eyes and not from any extrajudicial denunciation or any inquiry that he might set up. But these are unusual circumstances. Most of the bishops’ knowledge comes from someone complaining to him about the abuse by a priest under his control, and those allegations are covered by the secret. Those who accidentally come across this information are also bound by the secret. Francis knows about the secret because the Argentinian protocol which was two years in the drafting, was signed off by his fellow bishops one month after he became pope. Art 17 states “as a first warning” that these cases are subject to the pontifical secret.",

If they had done that, they would have noticed that the son was sitting in his seat and corrected the seating chart. 2) Once they (should have) realized that there had been a mistake in seating the standby person, they should have asked the standby to go back to the gate, or reassign him a seat, instead of forcing the kid out of his. 3) The standby person should have realized the situation and left the seat rather than be selfish and take the seat away from the kid.

Currently, police confront aggressively and thus place themselves in harm's way.  Consequently, police shoot to kill to protect themselves at the first, often misinterpreted, sign of threat.  Once in a while aggressive approach is necessary.  Usually, the matter in question is not so important and it would be better to let the perp go rather than to kill him.

Of course, the CDF (so zealous that it misunderstood Farley's intent to propose a framework for discussion and accused her of proclaiming a new doctrine, which she of course never wanted to do) condemned Farley's work - thereby providing the author with a marketing coup she could have never dreamed of.

Gore lost and the street fighters won. So it has been ever since. \n\nWhenever Republicans can find a loophole to circumvent the law, procedure, precedent, whatever it takes to win, they take it, and the people who vote for them register their approval by reelecting them. That means that if our democracy is being whittled away by the present Republican-controlled Congress it is because their constituents in their gerrymandered districts have allowed it. Something tells me that when the full implications of their actions dawn on them down the line they'll regret having supported people who violated two centuries of convention for short-term political gain.

I told him this & no matter what his mom did to him to remember what I said. His father was sitting right there & didn't say a thing. He was an officer in the Air Force. I sometimes wish I had slapped the shit out of her & taken her boy by the hand & home with me. I don't know whatever happened to him & I do think of him sometimes.  I'm hoping that I made an impact on his life. Sometimes simple is the best we can do.",

It is also up to moderate Muslims to break this link to the Wahhabis. They don't seem to be doing a good job of this as evidenced by the visiting Imam to a mosque in Montreal who preached killing jews one by one; and apparently no Muslim in the mosque reported this incendiary speech to the authorities. Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than covered up.",

In my post, I specifically reference that many of these alleged rapes and sexual assualts involve \"date\" or \"acquaintance\" actions.  There are seldom wittnesses (not a big surprise).  The \"rape kits\" are usually irrelevant since the defense is almost always \"yes, we had sex....but it was consensual.\"  You need to remember the schools have NO CHOICE but to launch a \"genuine\" investigation of their own.

Its all on her. And what is her sentence? Three years with two suspended. How long is her probation period? Do you know? Its not written anywhere. One year, Richard, is not enough time for justice.

Absolutely horrifying. There is one region in the country as well where tribal leaders refuse to allow \"their women\" to have any rights; they are literally barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.\n\nThe bishops of India see firsthand what patriarchy has done to the women of India and have the moral courage to become agents of change.

It was impossible to provide for them all. I placed the unwanted kittens in a gunny sack containing a stone, tied up the sack, and placed it in a pond so that the kittens would drown. It was a painless death. In another case, to avoid offspring, I shot and killed our mother cat. Often such methods prevent unnecessary suffering of animals. I also shoot and kill porcupines whenever I can. When our dogs go after them, the porcupines slap their tails at the dogs, and the dogs come home with hurtful quills. When we pull out these quills, the dogs suffer considerable pain. Mercy killing is often the best solution to save animals from pain.",

Personal opinion is not a good basis for moral or dogmatic teachings.\n\nIt can be invoked when the person does not have an actual argument. A good example is in Humanae Vitae 4, which says essentially \"we know the natural law, and you will just have to take our word for it\". That's not an argument, that's blather.\n\nWhen it does not actually describe how nature works. Humanae Vitae says that in nature, sexual intercourse is used for procreation.

I am sorry but I disagree with you on the principle of \"corporate judgement for corporate sin\". On the Last Day each individual, in this case each individual bishop will be called to account for his deeds before Christ; the College of Bishops will not be judged corporately. For this reason I don't think that \"corporate sin\" exists at all. Each of us has the choice of collaborating with others in doing evil or of not collaborating. Whether we join with them or not is entirely an individual decision as we are in possession of free will.

I understand that the Koine Greek word \"porneia\" is debated, but I read an intriguing argument for its being translated as \"adultery\" - in the sense of secretive sexual intercourse with a man other than the woman's husband - as the more accurate term. This is based on the fact that in the Septuagint translation, the word \"porneia\" is often used in a phrase alongside another Greek word, \"moixeia\", to translate OT Hebrew phrases in which both words, in each context, refer to such manner of adultery.",

Instead of a winner-take-all approach, which, as you say, can result in all the power given to the most populous states, it would mean more to make sure every political party that represents us finds a seat at the table.  One of the biggest mistakes our Founding Fathers made was to reject a parliamentary form of government.  In their rush to declare independence, they experimented with a different kind of democracy.

He'll, my 14 year old cat would be a better president. Trump is a terrible president; the worst we ever had and that is saying something.

If the salesperson felt unable to to reach the assigned target, then \"no\" would have been the right answer -- not \"force-selling\" or (worse still) raising credit limits or moving customers to pricier accounts on the sly. These are the illegal actions of individual employees.  I doubt very much that TD promotes and condones institutionalized fraud. \n\nCustomers are responsible for consent too.

Whites use more methamphetamines, hallucinogens, OxyContin and cocaine than other ethnic groups. Black people, however, are arrested at three times the rate that whites are for drugs. On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.",

That happens over and over in countless work environments across around the world. Where have you been?\n\nThe whole purpose of having those drinks is to \"loosen up,\" after all.

The other problem is that many communities are not sustainable and depend on outside resources to survive. The whole concept of a reserve is racist and will probably not work long term, calling them first nations is just double speak. Do not expect things to improve because there is an industry keeping things the way they are and in the end it will be the people who live on reserves who solve their problems or not.

What Canada has to do is have a tight labor supply, so that the job vacancy rate stays above 3.5%, starting by reducing immigration rates by 90% and making sure 90% of desired population growth comes from Canadian born children. No more of this abuse and utter absurdity of having work opportunities and taxpayer resources going to people in need that aren't already citizens here . Wake-up Canadians!

Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs, which will likely have their own hazards, and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die.

The fact that she has had 2 domestic violence charges, 1 still pending, certainly makes it more likely that she was a fault and honestly makes it more likely that even if she isn't, that she won't get off with no penalties from this.  1 domestic, I can see, depending on the state, someone gets arrested, no matter what in a domestic, but 2 followed by this certainly leads me and many other commenters to believe that she is as guilty as she looks.  She has already been convicted in the court of public opinion, now it is up for the courts to decide.  \n\nWhat I find most amusing is that I have seen posts from you and other conservatives that wouldn't have given her the benefit of the doubt if she were not a white woman.

The attack on Parliament Hill was an even more obvious case of retaliation. Parliament Hill was where our troops were ordered to kill in Afghanistan. Clearly retaliation.\n\nInstead the killing of Canadian soldiers “was inspired by the Islamic State.” How American that statement is.",

But not ALL Muslim countries, and it affects a relatively small percentage of Muslims --- those from countries that pose the most significant threat of terrorism.  If he wanted to discriminate against Muslims qua Muslims, he did a pretty bad job of it.  And the ban is only temporary, until the people affected by it can be properly vetted.  Given the risks that terrorists pose, that's not unreasonable, not when almost every significant act of terrorism in the world is accompanied by shouts of \"Allahu Akbar.\"",

But with this freedom there seems to be an attitude. Or is it my first experience of a person expressing there rights as they see them as they have seen them exercised by other groups. I think there may be a danger to do just that. I say this because I have done the same thing in my life after I was an abused teenager. I grew up to become just like the two people that had charge over me. To my horror. Then spend the next forty years trying to become the person I thought I would become. Having to undo much of who I had become. I hope you understand what I am getting at. I am not biased but concerned. Thanks.",

That is not what happened.  A small number (in the overall context) of people were apparently killed by chemicals.  Use of CW to cause this small pocket of deaths provided negligible military advantage but did provide dramatic effect, a high probability dramatic effect, of opening direct conflict between the Syrian government and the US.  In the end, Assad cannot survive US involvement; therefore, out of his self interest, he would not use CW.  The rebels win big through their use.",

I would like to believe that his family used proper family values in this very private matter. That the proper authorities used proper legal judgment in this very private family matter.  That both the victim and Luke Heimlick, with time, and a family bound together, will overcome this. I wish that. For I don't wish failure to anyone.",

And love can be  like chasing your tail, the harder you pursue the more it fades in to the distance.\n\nThere's more than ideology here, there's Russian culture as well-- Dusha---for years Russian immigrants in America  sometimes  said we white Americans have no \"soul\", or dusha.  True, it does lead to passionate romances and lots of joy, but for years Russia has been plagued by terribly high rates of abortion, alcoholism  and domestic violence as well.  The current government seems to believe  a man's  first case of domestic abuse should not be prosecuted, as \"the husband naturally needs to take charge\".  Myself, the Russian ladies I met in 1968 were wonderful, I felt  they deserve better.\nDushevnaya  lyubov!",

They always know who is going to heaven (those who live the Bible word-for-word and call themselves Christian) and everyone else who is going south.  My family contains beliefs on both ends, which led to a total ban of religious discussion at any gathering.  Like other humble thinkers, I feel my strong spiritual belief is my own business, between me and my creator.  Just keeping myself humble and contemplative is a full-time occupation, let alone judging someone else's piety.  Why do some here have such a chip on their shoulder about religion?  Perhaps their beliefs are not quite firm enough for confidence, and they must constantly defend themselves for fear they might begin to doubt.",

The defendant in this case is not black but he is Hispanic. \nSo, it might be Jeff Session whose has the final say if the prosecutor decides to go for the death penalty. \nHave no idea if this man had any prior convictions or if he is a pillar of the community. \nMy guess is that they will not go for the death penalty.

We have a large variety of retiree's, business owners, summertime employees for local business's and families. As it is with many people through out all of America I believe are financially challenged. That most certainly does not equate to the idea of state assistance.\nFor two. Whittier is a tourist destination by millions. Working on the tourist end of it for many years, most questions pertained to the history of the town. And the history is what brought them here in the first place.\nFor three. Begich Towers is a large part of that history. So as we depend on tourism for a lifestyle here. We took a loan to help preserve that part of history that would be lost for generations to come.\nI'm very sorry that not all can understand that.",

It is not a unique happening.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, that this store's computers didn't put out regular reports of void activity by checker that would have warned the store manager - or even distant corporate accounting personnel - that there was a problem. \n\nSome retailers even post this information regularly on break room bulletin boards, allowing checkers to constantly compare themselves to their co-workers.  Some retail chains consider repeated void activity to be a productivity issue as well as a theft issue.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Read a really good book about two decades ago where the author tried to explain why there are cultural differences between our races.  He basically boiled it down to location.  Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.  It certainly doesn't mean someone from an equatorial climate couldn't successfully enter the more technological environment.

The people who went to Syria to fight for (or against) ISIS are likely motived by the thrill of the fight, more than any strict adherence to religious doctrine.

This is going on today.\n\n In other situations it is is precisely the reason I wrote men should be held accountable for the children they abandon from their sexual exploits.  Sex is mostly a free pass when it comes to the children men create.  The only brake on it are religious precepts that demand a wife.  It's plain biology and according to the Church, biology is natural law.  Men should pay the price for the children they abandon no matter how they conceived them.  If the pro life movement is going to insist women pay a criminal or spiritual price for a pregnancy they didn't want, so should men. Period. End of discussion.",

Sexual assault is a sexual act in which a person is coerced or physically forced to engage against their will, or a non-consensual sexual touching of a person. Sexual assault is a form of sexual violence, and it includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration or drug facilitated sexual assault), groping, forced kissing,[citation needed] child sexual abuse, or the torture of the person in a sexual manner.[1][2][3]\n\n  You seem to imply that anything short of rape really isn't sexual assault.  Few jurisdictions...none that I know of..share your perspective.  You refer to women who take grevious offense at unwanted touching (groping) as whinners and suggest such groping is \"inconsequential.\"  You really seem to suggest that women should just be \"better sports\" about receiving unwanted sexual advances (short of rape, of course) and not get so (to use your phrase) \"pissed off\" about it.

I certainly think all manner of nonsexual assaults are more physically and mentally traumatic than any harassment that falls short of actual violence. Violence gets underrated due to pop culture.
