I assume that I need to be fixed as I believe in equality for all and would never tell a group that \"I don't care about you,\" based on their skin colour or gender.\n I am a teacher and I find the most unhappy students are those whose parents encourage whining and help them blame others rather than being responsible, respectful and grateful.

Still Obama managed to borrow more money than all other presidents put together, and US now owns more than 25% of the world debt, effectively guaranteeing the US' imminent decline and fadeout from 21st century history. Calling him the worst president in history is a woefully inadequate statement.",

This was basically the trickle down from this story. \n\nThere is the strong possibility that this was fully intentional. At Maria's canonization Pius XII contrasted the \"the unhealthy marshes and filth of the world\" (read: sex outside marriage) with the \"solemn duty\" to be on guard against said dangers and the mother who \"educated\" Maria to this very martyrdom--and he used that word. \n\nJob well done, mother?  \n\nIt's so twisted I can't even wrap my head around it.

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex? Once upon a time, girls had to own their bad decisions but now they have Title IX on campuses which allows those who regret having sex while drunk to claim they were raped.

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

Buy up rental housing and rent it out.  Makes them money, they get to own property, we get a place to live.  Done.\n\n2) Cap the primary residence cap gains exemption at $250K.

The problem is the Voting Right Act that requires minorities to be given special treatment.  Such a computer program would probably get thrown out and we'd be back to square one.\n\nThe worst case is when we have 60-40 districts.  80-20 is actually better than 60-40, because 60-40 still means the 60 side always wins, with 40% always misrepresented.  At least when it's 80-20, only 20% are misrepresented.\n\n50-50 is best, since it should produce a consistent stream of moderate reps from each party rotating through.  But that's very hard to accomplish such balance in more than maybe 1 or 2 districts.  Complicating it further is how to count the U's. Especially now, as the stupid law allowing U's to vote in party primaries means many true D's and R's and now registering as U's.  You simply cannot assume that most U's are in the middle anymore.",

Four kittens from that colony (b-b-but I thought these colonies were supposed to be spayed/neutered!) got rabies from a raccoon attracted to the food put out for them, and the idiot \"care-takers\" foisted the kittens on a local pet shop which sold them to different households.

Otherwise it could have been 665 horrible DEATHS.\n\nThanks to these \"no-kill\" nitwits and TNR charlatans, cats have accounted for one-third of all human rabies exposures in the US for the last 22 years (Gerhold & Jessup, 2012).",

Theologians were arguing against the exegesis just as vigorously as legislators were arguing against legal racism. \n\nUnfortunately, re gay marriage, the theologians are lagging behind the legislators, and it is this sad fact that renders on-going gay discrimination in the name of religious conscience not exactly the same thing. \n\nThose of us who reject the religious arguments against gay marriage must be very careful, it seems to me, that we do not end up arguing that the law need not take religious conscience into account. As long formal religion continues to reject gay marriage, there is, it seems to me, very sadly, a need to respect bigoted but honest consciences. Sad!!",

Terms like \"Divine Will\" and \"attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage...\" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which \"long held\" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility.",

The latter pay a fraction of what more lucrative clinical activities would. \n\nThe tax change leaves us with 3 options; 1) take a haircut   2)dissolve group arrangements so that we can each benefit from a small business tax deduction   3) reduce time spent on poorly paid activities.

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex.

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

He cheated on every one of his three wives. He has been accused by a dozen women of sexual assault and rape. He admits he walked into dressing rooms where girls as young as 15 were nude. He bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. Funny how you left all that out. I'd call that pretty bad behavior.",

Does this mean he couldn't understand or represent the black experience, as some American blacks argued to be the case? Skin colour or apparent race isn't the sole determinant of identity. Perhaps all  multigenerational North Americans should take one of those DNA ancestry tests that are advertised on television.. Many of us are probably much more diverse than we might imagine. Genealogical research into my family's background has uncovered some surprising facts, including that we had a  great grandmother who was of Portuguese descent.

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

Canada did it right. When threatened they went in and killed 80 wolves immediately and said \"we're done\". Peta never had a chance to raise a dime and ceased threatening Canada.

We used charts showing how much the price of nat gas had risen since the early 70's and projected that 30 years into the future to justify the cost.  But in 1983, the deregulated price of nat gas led production to meet demand, and the price has been coming down as fast as those solar panels came off the rooftops.  There aren't any tax credits for parts and repairs on those damned things, so it wasn't worth it to fix them for the small amount it was saving on the utility bill.",

Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the “comfort women” who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

By now most of us realize that Trump is a liar who lies about both the big important things as well as the most trivial and inconsequential matters.\n\nAnd for your information (to counter your deliberate lie) Mr. Remington didn't \"criticize following tax law\", he merely asked \"who wrote the law, and what did they have to gain...?\"\n\nThis is most telling - \"better to keep that money and donate it...\"",

Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader.",

Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.\n\nIronically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.

So, this article would have been useless at the time. The reality is, most people don't make enough money to save until they reach their 40s,  let alone learn how to invest properly (Hint: sack your investment advisor; they are little more than rapacious weasels). Then there's those gnarly things called mortgages. Sure, save 20 times your family income AND pay off a mortgage. Quelle planet du vien-tu? \nSo I had to learn on the fly and sock money away like a squirrel. Enjoyed self-employment until I retired in my 50s. Now enjoying life more. Globe articles like this are so out of touch with reality, they should charge the 'experts' for the advertising. It's blatant self-promotion containing a mere scintilla of reality.",

Their cultural loss is staggering. Their generational cultural loss is immeasurable. There is no going back - only forward.  I learned young that \"proud\" is not a word I should use to describe the Alaska native - in fact, it's a bit of an insult.

As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

For Sakic to get a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round pick plus 3 young players and a throw in back up goalie is amazing. The Girard kid they got from Nashville is only 19 and was playing at this very young age as a defensemen on one of the best teams in the league. He scored over a point a game in major juniors which for a d-man is very good. In his first 5 games for Nashville he was already producing scoring a goal and having 2 assists.

Obama broke new ground by defying the very structure of our government put in place by our founders to limit any one branches overreach. Reagan , Carter, Clinton all had to deal with opposing forces in the Congress and respected the system enough to do so. Cooperation which often led to sensible bi-partisan legislation that truly served the electorate as a whole. Awash in his limitless arrogance Obama simply didn't care and now Dems will pay a price.

A motion on equality and non-discrimination should reflect that in the very nature of it's wording.

Canada can be 100% self sufficient if we wanted to be. The amount of land and resources we posses relative to our population means we are some of the richest people on the planet. China can't say the same. Your 1.4 billion people NEED to import resources. We don't NEED to sell you anything or buy anything from you. We CHOOSE to do so because it makes life cheaper and easier, nothing more. I do my part to make this happen by purchasing local products as much as I can. \n\nI have no problem renegotiating NAFTA, even with Trump the Americans are far better trading partners than the Chinese will ever be.

He did the impossible, and won it all.  He got all the attention, the TV-time, etc., for free.  In the process he took them all out, and they were professional politicians.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

It's a man that started at third base while the real estate market hit a homer, convinced himself it was his brilliance, and STILL barely managed to escape financial ruin many times, only by the deft of his bankruptcy attorneys. \n\nFour massive bankruptcies, hundreds of lawsuits by unpaid contractors, creditors, and labor groups, his real liquid income hidden under an abyss of real estate vehicles. Strip away his daddy's cash and his army of attorneys, and you have just an angry old white man that would probably be buying up gold bullion and gold-plated commemorative coins if not for his east coast pedigree. \n\nThe only thing that stands out more than Trump's poor temperament, is his astonishing business stupidity. Especially given he started with $200 million from his old man in the 1970s (which today would be closer to $700 or $800 million), which he still managed to lose several times over.",

This kind of shame and guilt can, with other factors, lead to arrested psychosexual development.

In fact, not only have they traveled deep into the park, but they have spawned, quite successfully in fact, throughout the river and tributaries opened up by dam removal. Salmon, as it turns out, are a very real source of income for thousands of fisherman across the state, and up in Alaska...  \n\nThird, the fix you suggest for US 101 is absurd, and a hell of a lot more expensive and potentially dangerous than building a new bridge.

Deliberate polarisation banishes civility, goodwill, adult behaviour, and reason.\n.\nFor example, when people march at night with torches shouting white supremacist slogans, or harass women at abortion clinics, it isn't about freedom of speech.

The first one who spoke did not initiate the contact with the media, but it was done by a friend who, given the \"Bush\" video, thought the unwelcome contact should be brought to public attention. ABC, I believe, encouraged her to describe what happened, overcoming her reluctance. This wasn't any grand conspiracy, bu t was the not-uncommon experience of similar cases of serial abuse victims.\n\nBoth she and Dianne Ackerson are given to gratuitous vulgarisms. \"Broad?,\" \"fricken liar?\" I would hope that women would take their prospective real estate business elsewhere, leaving her to reap the consequences of her ignorance.",

They wisely (IMO) chose to not \"storm\" the apartment and force a possible armed conflict.  I certainly agree with that decision.  However, if I'm understanding things correctly, they left the scene with the intent of \"arresting him later.\"  That makes no sense to me.  It may have taken time to negotiate his surrender, but it would have been time well-spent.  If, in fact, he had a gun and had threatened the girlfriend, it makes no sense to me to say, in essence, \"Hey, we're leaving now....see you later.\"  It seems there's a lot of \"middle ground\" between \"killing the guy\" and walking away from the scene.......What do you think?  thanks, Gary",

It would prevent pregnancy in the first place. Only when she knows that her mate will stick around and support her that it is OK to become pregnant.\n\nAs for promiscuity, well, humans have been promiscuous for millions of years because it is in our genes that we have sex as often as we can in order to produce offsprings. That is why sex is very pleasurable - to encourage us to do it often. Sure, many people have the self-control to resist their desire for the pleasure but there are many who give in to it or are in danger of rape so they should have access to birth control just in case.",

Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked.

But now that their pet project , Bombardier is under attack, they feel outraged and the PM is happy to join in.

After all this is a country (and an organization) which supposedly tried to send exploding cigars to Fidel Castro and then supported an ill fated invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.  It interfered in the Chilean election of Salvador Allende resulting in the takeover by General Pinochet with detrimental results on the Chilean people.  And what about the the weapons of mass destruction fiasco and the invasion of Iraq which has further destabilized the Middle East.  It is also important to remember the United States, along with Canada and other western nations, sent troops into Russia during the Russian Civil War.  An old aggression but one probably not forgotten.  Is there really any difference between these activities and Mr. Putin's?",
