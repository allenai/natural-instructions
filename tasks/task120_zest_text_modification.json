        "Please change the meaning of the following question by changing as few words as possible. Create different questions with the same output format (i.e., if the given question has a yes/no answer, so should yours, etc.). The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the changed questions, this keyword should also be used the same way. All the questions should be written so that your new question will have a different answer than the original. Leave the original sentence the same as much as possible, changing only the meaning of the question. Try to write specific questions that are not too easy. Make your questions specific and concrete rather than open-ended or subjective (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people). Your questions should change the original question as little as possible."
