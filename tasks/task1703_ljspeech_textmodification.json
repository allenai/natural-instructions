    "Definition": [
        "The task is reading a paragraph containing numbers as digits. The digits can be used to represent Quantity, Dates and Time, Addresses or Positions. Convert the digits into their text equivalents. If a number has a prefix, postfix or punctuation preserve it in the text equivalent. 100000 is translated as hundred thousand, Roman numerals are also translated. If multiple numbers are present convert all instances."
