    "Definition": "This task is about using the specified sentence and converting the sentence to Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets of the form (subject, predicate object). The RDF triplets generated must be such that the triplets accurately capture the structure and semantics of the input sentence. The input is a sentence and the output is a list of triplets of the form [subject, predicate, object] that capture the relationships present in the sentence. When a sentence has more than 1 RDF triplet possible, the output must contain all of them.",

            "explanation": "This is a good example since the subject of the sentence is University of Mississipi and it is connected to the object (SELC) via the predicate (new_conference). The output RDF captures the key elements of the sentence and is easily interpretable as well."
