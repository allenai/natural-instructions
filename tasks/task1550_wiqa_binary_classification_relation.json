    "Definition": "You need to answer the question 'Are the given steps related to the given question' given a set of steps describing a process and a question about the steps. Your answer must be either Yes or No. If the answer is Yes, the question is addressing information presented in the steps. If the answer is No, the question is addressing content that is not related to the steps",
