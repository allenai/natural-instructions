            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. For starters, the maps are woefully inadequate. There aren't enough of them, they lack sufficient detail, and there is no number and letter grid system. That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical. Making matters worse, the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended.

I was given \"Waking the Dead\" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.     John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like \"The Matrix\" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.     The author also presents the image of God as \"my friend\". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.     This is exactly the same theology as building the largest \"Christian\" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to \"offend anyone\". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.     Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of \"setting hearts free\". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not \"free\" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, \"Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ\"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.     For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend \"The Way of the Master\" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.",

Got a great book the other day called The Medici Effect: What Elephants & Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation by Frans Johansson.

Contents:  Part 1 - The Intersection: The Intersection - Your Best Chance To Innovate; The Rise of Intersections  Part 2 - Creating the Medici Effect: Break Down the Barriers Between Fields; How to Make the Barriers Fall; Randomly Combine Concepts; How to Find the Combinations; Ignite an Explosion of Ideas; How to Capture the Explosion  Part 3 - Making Intersectional Ideas Happen: Execute Past Your Failures; How to Succeed in the Face of Failure; Break Out of Your Network; How to Leave the Network Behind; Take Risks and Overcome Fear; How to Adopt a Balanced View of Risk; Step into the Intersection  Notes; Index; About the Author    The Medici Effect is all about the intersection of ideas, cultures, disciplines, and strategies in new and previously unexplored ways.  The term comes from the Medici family in Florence Italy in the 15th century.  A convergence of thinkers and doers all converged on Florence, which became ground zero for the Renaissance period.  New concepts thrived in that environment where people were learning and listening to each other, breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study.  Johansson asserts (and correctly so, in my opinion) that innovation thrives in these \"intersections\" that are missed by many, but offer the best chance for breaking away from the \"same old thing\".    The book is extremely practical, in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers.  You'll see how Richard Garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game Magic: The Gathering.  The singer Shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own (and very popular to boot).  Eric Bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling.  These and many other examples show how being a generalist (or at least open to other fields) can lead to connections not possible for highly specialized thinkers.  Johansson lays out steps you can take to place yourself in that constant flow of ideas, so that you can start seeing new possibilities in rather mundane unrelated things.    I was very impressed with this book, and have already started to look at events and ideas in a different light.  I'd recommend this read for anyone looking to spur their creativity beyond the norm...",

Not a very good one at least. This book is a noble attempt, but there is just so much that's wrong with it.    For one thing, there is just some bad writing in it. It has a lot of errors in fact and a lot of typos. Among others, he writes that Texas A&M University (rather than Texas Tech) is in Lubbock, and he says that Ryne Sandberg in in the Baseball Hall of Fame (he just should be soon). There is also bad grammar (this is beyond the Texas colloquialisms in the book which I think are fine-I'm a Texan myself). These are fairly small problems, but they are oftly annoying, and they are not good signs in a book written by a journalist who's supposed to report facts. Furthermore, he just has few narrative talents, at least not those required for a book. He tells the stories as a journalist on Headline News would--concise, to the point, and without much flavor. They're just there; the reader is rarely drawn in.    The most glaring flaw, though, is that there are a lot of flaws in logic in the book. For instance, one of the stories is about a ten-year-old boy who realizes that many of the underpriveleged at his school cannot afford school supplies, so he works together an organization that collects and disperses those needed supplies. This is all obviously a good thing. But then, Rather relates a joke told by the boy's mother who said she needed to haul the school supplies around so she \"traded in [her] Lexus for a Durango, and now [she's] getting a Yukon because the Durango isn't big enough.\" My problem is the huge contrast here. On one hand, there are all of these kids lacking necessities and the heroes who are helping them are laughing about purchasing one expensive SUV after another for themselves. How is this inequality emblematic of the American Dream? How does this book manage to lament the rising poverty rates and terrible living conditions and still manage to promote excessive materialism? There are some people in the book who are praised for having overcome hardship to make millions (some of them stepping on other people's heads to do so) and others who are praised for having given up millions to help those in need. Frankly, these two \"ideals\" don't go together. Nevertheless, these people, according to Rather, have all attained the American dream. There are a lot of contradicting ideas expressed in these stories. Furthermore, I don't really think Rather has a great concept of what the American dream is. When Sister Sylvia Schmidt founds a homeless shelter in Tulsa, OK, I don't think she is following the American Dream. I think she's following dreams that go far beyond the American Dream, and I think she's rejecting the prevalent, primarily materialistic, concept of the American Dream of today's society.    I'm giving the book two stars because I like Dan Rather, and because some of the stories were rather inspiring. Neverthess, it's not a good book. I will continue to watch Dan Rather on tv, but I'm quite sure I won't read a book by him again",

He approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts. One way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent. This he did do. He seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists. Ultimately, Work's overhaul (i.e., paradigm shift) for viewing the Word of God was simply over the top and without warrant.

The subtitle of the book, \"The Friendship That Won The Civil War\" would imply that there really was a friendship, and indeed it seems the relationship between Grant and Sherman was destined to create a winning duo. That makes it unique, not just because of the resultant Union victory, but it really does stand out as the one relationship among the senior leadership of both sides that was capable of creating the kind of synergism necessary to win the struggle. The only other comparable relationship was Lee and Jackson, which was every bit as successful, but didn't survive the war.  There are too many anectdotes in the book to mention, but I can say that I learned a lot more than I had previously gleened from separate biographies. Grant was clearly a victim of disappointing performances by subordinates, Sherman being a glowing exception. And Sherman's armies needed the type of visionary leadership that ultimately unleashed them to win. Yet the contingent nature of the events leading to the monumental victories are pointed out again and again. Such were the nature of promotions and military politics in the day.  A fast paced read. The relatively quick descriptions of the battles are much appreciated. If Grant and Sherman seemed like inspiring characters before, Hood's book will convince you that the story of their friendship not only won the war, but had a profound impact on 19th century America well beyond 1865",

Also, I was constantly detracted by the overuse and inappropriate use of adjectives, metaphors and cliched phrases. The one thing this book had going for it was the plot. The prologue was the only thing that I would consider decently written in the entire novel. There are glaring disrepencies throughout the novel that absolutly could not be ignored. The characters switch back and forth so much you cannot get a grasp as to who they really are. Because of this they seem supremely superficial. This book came across as being very quickly written as there are so many jumps from scene to scene and very obvious contradictions that it was really difficult for me to get as far as I did.

After working in a church in Boston and another in Washington, D.C., minister Ed Wilcox and his family have transferred to the Consolidated Community Church in Emerald Springs, Ohio. His wife, Aggie, initially has her doubts about settling down in a small town, but eventually she, Ed, and their two young children find themselves making friends, except for elderly parishioner Gelsey Falowell who despises Ed and wants to get rid of him. Gelsey's wish may come true when the naked body of a murder victim is left on the Wilcox's front porch and Ed, who had been counseling the dead woman, is the chief suspect. Aggie knows that Ed is innocent but wonders why Ed is keeping secrets from her especially when her daughter Teddy tells her she saw her father fighting with the dead woman. When a second murder is committed and detective Kirkor Roussos seems to suspect Ed committed both crimes, Aggie, with the help of her friend, real estate agent Lucy Jacobs, begins investigating the murders. The more Aggie looks into the crimes the more she realizes that people, especially Gelsey, have secrets that have been buried for years and some people will kill to have them remain secret.    \"Blessed is the Busybody\" is a good beginning to what looks to be a good mystery series. The characters are well written and well defined. The mystery is written from the view point of Aggie, revealing various bits of her unconventional childhood, plus her struggles to raise her children especially oldest daughter Deena, who at eleven is just starting to rebel a little bit. Both Teddy and Deena are well written and come across as real children. Aggie's friend Lucy is so well written that I could picture here while reading the book. Ed comes across as a bit bland, but I suspect that will change in future books. Author Emilie Richards does a good job describing small town life and the secrets hidden there and the town itself was like a character in the book. The mystery is well written with plenty of surprising secrets slowly revealed as the book goes on. The mystery is complex yet satisfying, if a bit sad. But there's a nice gentle humor throughout the book that takes the edge off the sadder elements.    \"Blessed is the Busybody\" is well worth reading.",

            "input": "If I could choose 0 stars, I would. . I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.    I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.    Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?    Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her \"monologues\" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!    I also hated how the book shifted \"voices\" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.    What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.    All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.    The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to",

The recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes.  However, I found that there were too many Southwestern Chili type recipes for my taste.  If you like to make chili and lots of Mexican and Southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you.  That is not to say that there aren't some Mediterranean and Caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the Tex-Mex and Southwestern flavors beat out the others.

I love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine.

In the same vein I understand that the author is an M.S., R.D. but I really don't think there is a need to use Fat-Free Dressing for everything.

Thus, I get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients.      One more irksome tidbit was the fact that there weren't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi, adzuki, flageolet, cranberry to name a few.    This cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook can offer",

            "input": "Exploding myths about Red Hollywood . Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's \"Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left.\"     Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.    The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true \"United Frontism\" and \"Popular Front\" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed \"revisionist\" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like \"Mission to Moscow,\" \"The Spanish Earth,\" and \"The North Star.\" Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.    I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.    I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another \"we were innocent\" propaganda piece.",

Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.    Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?    Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.    Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.

While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology.

The characters are real and display emotions and feelings everyone can identify with. The power of novel becomes apparent when you are reading it. You choke up every once a while, you smile for hours after you have finished reading certain passages, and you comprehend your own self, your woes and possibilities, better through perspectives that novel provides.    Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. The initial quarter of the novel is about his growing up, and details incidents and relationships that shape our hero. He then develops a fancy of becoming a painter and travels to Paris, only to quit few years later to return to London, where he studies to become a doctor. The most engrossing part of novel starts here with the entry of Mildred, the waitress.    The rest of the novel thrives on the passion of Philip, his love that carries him to the edge of self-destruction, and his coming of age. Unrequited love has never been potrayed better. Philip allows himself to become an instrument in hands of cold-hearted Mildred, who repeatedly ruins herself through absurd choices, and ruins him for not withstanding his love and care, he finds himself snubbed, ridiculed, bereft. Eventhough his reason tells him otherwise, Philip is unable to release himself from his passion for a considerable time. As is said in the novel, \"But when all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his whole soul.\"    The novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters and each friend he makes, leaves an indelible impression on him and the reader. Be it his idealist friend Hayward, who has too much promise too little product, the poet Cronshaw who dies in poverty, Fenny Price whose hard work cannot make her draw even reasonably well, his uncle and aunt whose love is both tacit and beautifully potrayed and the writer Norah who shows Philip of a caring and loving other.     The most charming people in the novel are Athlneys. Athlney brings life and humor into the novel, and I think saves Philip from a total destruction. The novel really highlights the virtue that lies in a simple, happy married life and Anthlneys win over both Philip and readers with their goodness and simplicity. Thorpe Anthlney with his nine children is a jolly character, and be it his conversations or actions, he wins over our hearts outright.     Philip finds love in most unexpected quarters and is surprised by how help crops up from strangers. His every experience makes him as richer as the reader becomes in reading about it. The thoughts about the meaning of life, or about love or religion or about virtue or vice, and about each aspect of life that Philip encounters are spelt out with a subtlety and mastery. These thoughts find easy resonance with the reader, and make Of Human Bondage an unforgettable affair. The honesty of this piece is stunning. This novel, written without any flourishes and intricate wordplay or mystery, is I think a celebration of the deep insight and understanding of the author.    I have read his other works. The Razor's Edge, The Moon and Six Pence as well as his short stories are a proof of Maugham's ability to tell simple tales with great mastery. These, on their own, make Maugham a great novelist. But it is after reading Of Human Bondage that I realized why most novelists and readers have considered this piece as one the greatest pieces in World Literature. Maugham's aim was perhaps of catharisis and he put his own emotions into the characters, and therefore, he's created a work that is timeless and unforgettable. A must read for everyone who can read.",

            "input": "The Patrol is ordered to destroy the 'Queen' . \"Plague Ship\" (1956) was one the first science fiction novels I ever checked out of our local library (I can still close my eyes and see that one dinky little shelf, crammed with some of SFs' greatest juvenile authors:  Norton; Heinlein; Del Rey; Nourse).    This book contains the second 'Solar Queen' adventure.  Norton's four-book series about the trader-crew of the 'Solar Queen' ended in 1969 with \"Postmarked the Stars\" but beware! Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master just recently passed away after a long and extremely fruitful career (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2005).    One 'Solar Queen' rip-off to avoid at all costs is \"Redline: the Stars.\"      Norton's 'Solar Queen' stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced in \"Sargasso of Space,\" the first 'Solar Queen' novel, as a \"lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.\"  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.    After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' \"lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted\" was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns \"to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.\"       Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.    \"Plague Ship\" takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.  When Dane Thorson discovers an herb that the Salariki are willing to swap for their gems, he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child.    That becomes the least of his worries when the 'Solar Queen' blasts off from Sargol with invisible, undetectable stowaways that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds.    In space, the more senior members of the 'Solar Queen's' crew succumb to a strange plague that resembles sleeping sickness.  Dane and his fellow-apprentices, with the assistance of Captain Jellico's Hoobat (a sort of blue parrot-lizard, or at least that's how I've always pictured it) discover the source of the plague: venomous hitch-hikers from Sargol.  \"It walked erect on two threads of legs...a bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle's shell ended in a sharp point.\"  It was only about a foot-and-a-half high and could change color like a chameleon.    The Hoobat kills and eats the first creature, and then the hunt is on for others of its kind.    Even with the source of the sleeping sickness discovered, the 'Solar Queen's' young apprentices must still convince the rest of the galaxy that they are not a plague ship--and therefore eligible to be destroyed on sight without warning.    The 'Solar Queen' novels are prime representatives of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling (at least the ones she solo-authored.)  If you haven't read them since you were a teen-ager, I urge you to try them again.  For a few pleasant hours, you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable, feisty band of free traders on exotic, carefully-drawn alien worlds.",

This is really rather sad, as Levenda is a talented writer, who has done, evidently, some significant research.  Unfortunately, it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the Bush clan, whilst holding the hideous Clintons above reproach, and worse, misses no opportunity to villify the Church, while smiling at Wicca.  The hypocricy is really breathtaking.    Understand that, in the corpus of this text, there is much that is worthwhile, certainly entertaining, and well presented.  It is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance.    This volume ends, as did the last, not with a bang, but with a whimper.  In fact, Levenda's last paragraph is, in its entirety, a quote from \"The Book of Ceremonial Magic\", of all things.  We are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series.  There is much else that cries out to be read.  We may read the next in volume, if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored.  But this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience.",

            "input": "\"He could not think of a single major act he'd managed of his own accord.\" . Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged.  Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided.  And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time.    It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin.  When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward.  In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds.    Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son.  She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious \"pet\" that lives with Macon.  As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers.    Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son.  Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple",

            "input": "Excellent answer to the question of the Gospels' genre . I have heard claims that the Gospels are \"metaphor\" or that they were never meant to be taken as biographical (and therefore don't have much or any historical data).  This book ably debunks such claims.    The intent of this book is not to prove the historicity of Gospels, but to prove their genre.  By establishing their genre, then we can better understand the intent of the authors.    The well reasoned conclusion in Burridge's book is: the Gospels fit the ancient genre of biography.    In doing so he discusses a lot about genre and analysis (this section was a bit tedious for me, but it was thorough).  In all of the discussion and examples we learn how the ancient biographies are much different from modern ones.  This is a key point, because I think much of the debates and criticisms of the gospels are done from the perspective of a modern biographical viewpoint.  The ancients wrote biographies differently than those that are written today.  But this does not make them more or less true.  It is a matter of emphasis.  Today we want to know the details about dates, eye color, and a year by year accounting of events.  The ancients were more selective in their biographies, and often focused on character not a chronological \"play by play\" of a person's life.  The ancient biographers did not just write to catalogue facts about a person, they often wrote to demonstrate why or why not we should emulate their subject.  Moderns too have such motives, and even biases, but they are often less up front about them.  In many ways the ancients are superior in this regard, because it makes it easier to distinguish between data and commentary.    In the end, Burridge gives several examples of biography from the ancient world, and demonstrates that the Gospels very clearly match their pattern.  Though there is variety between each of the biographies and the Gospels, they are clearly demonstrated to be part of the same family of literature.  This then establishes how the Gospel writers understood their own works to be - biographies of Jesus",

Three facts about economists teaching laypeople:    1: Economists love to be counter-intuitive.  2: Economists love to be controversial.  3: Economists love to go on about their personal opinions as though they were fact because, after the above two points, no one feels he or she can defend any contradicting opinion    This book suffers from the worst of these points. Yes, economics is sometimes quite the opposite of what one might think and is very often \"politically inviable\" because of its conclusions, but Mr. Landsburg goes far too much into the rhelm of \"I'm the author, you have to do what I say.\" I, too, agree that, for example, enviromental policies are often extremely ineffecient. However, if these policies are important to others, if they bring happiness or, in other words, \"utility\" to a degree greater than the opportunity costs incured, that's their business. The book is scattered with his belittlement of the poor idiots who don't understand economics and if they did they would think like him.     This is the sort of reason why people don't like econmists. This is why people think we're heartless prigs. If the people through whom this book must have gone before it was published knew enough about economics to defend their positions instead of just accepting the author as their better, they would have perhaps reminded him to tone down some of his particulars that he forms into generalities.

I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested.    But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him.  Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally.  She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners.  It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them.

Reagan began his acting career reading cue-cards in the service of General Electric during his stint at the \"GE Playhouse.\"  Reagan's move to the White House had him doing much the same, reading cue-cards written for him by Big Business, including GE, a weapons and energy conglomerate that owns NBC.  If people want to get a good feel for the Reagan administration, I'd recommend the books of Michael Parenti, who documents the legacy of dirty wars in Latin America and the global class war that is turning our planet into a dystopia of haves and have-nots.  Globalized \"Reaganomics\" (aka, neoliberalism) is  creating a planet of slums and prisons, war and ecocide.  The parts of government that served the general public are being shredded, while the entitlement programs of war profiteers and various robber barrons create record profits.  It's interesting to see the reverence Kim Jong Reagan receives; but whether people like him or not is immaterial, he wasn't in charge of the country.  Rather, very rich and powerful corporate executives and an army of lawyers and lobbyists entrenched themselves during the Reagan administration.  This corporate coup is something that many presidents have warned us about, including President Martin Van Buren who said, \"I am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion - the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government - would be exposed by any further increase in the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities.\"  If people can break-away from the Reagan illusion, and want to learn about real power in this country, I'd recommend the DVD \"The Corporation,\" and the books and radio show of Thom Hartmann.",

            "input": "Belaborment . Since many of the positives of this book were mentioned by other reviewers, I'd like to point out a few of the book's undesirable qualities.    First off, belaboring the point.  When I read a cookbook, each recipe doesn't specify to sift the flour.  That information is usually provided at the beginning and by inference is applied to all subsequent recipes.  When I read time and time again that Ed isn't using bottled oxygen, it starts to drive me nuts.  Yea I get it. You're the man.  You don't use supplemental oxygen unless you're a guide, so don't keep reminding me.  Maybe this style of writing was to make the record absolutely clear, I don't know.  For myself, I would appreciate an author more if they had faith in the readers to remember one generality placed in the beginning of the book.     Secondly, was this book edited?  On page 278 Ed says \"I've always believed that you need to listen to the mountain and watch for the signs it's giving you.\"  Then on page 282, on the same ascent of Annapurna, he says \"I've always believed that the mountain tells you whether to go up, stay put, or go down.\"  He just said this!  Even an amateur copy editor would see this and recommend removal.  Maybe this really isn't a 2nd criticism just a corollary of the first.    The negatives aside, the substory concerning the French hiker Jean-Christophe Lafaille was excellent.  And learning of Ed's early days in Washington racing up Rainier was pretty cool.  Ed's candor concerning other hiker partners is somewhat interesting, if almost risque.  I am thankful to Mountain Hardwear for providing this book for free......I would recommend taking it out on loan from the library because its definitely not work taking up space in a book shelf (there's little 2nd read potential here)",

The book is divided up into chapters such as 'Climbing with Style', which features articles about \"the whole art of natural protection\" written at the the start of the clean climbing revolution, and 'Further Aborad' which includes the authors account of a climb on Ama Dablam.    One of the features I most enoyed about the book was the introductions to various historical figures such as Smoke Blanchard and Royal Robbins. And the memoir style accounts of what it was like for a small band of climbers to live in the mountains away from civilization getting their kicks out of the \"simple joys\" and living in bare subsistence, long before climbing turned into the popular sport which it might be called today.    Doug Robinson is well qualified to write what he does, and his style is nice and clear without being base. Most of it is written in an autobiographical style, dealing with developments on the climbing and skiing scene for wenty odd years. If you are partial to a bit of Dharma Bums then get this book.

Using my Crock-Pot has saved us SO much money by not eating out, and the ingredients that this book calls for are very inexpensive for the most part.  It is also much healthier than eating out several nights a week.  The best part of this book is that you can always find a recipe that sounds great and you have all the stuff that you need for it in the house.  Really, all it takes is five minutes in the morning to throw it all in the Crock-Pot and then you have a great dinner!  I almost always just put the meat in there straight from the freezer and just add an hour or so of cooking time.  This would be a great gift for a shower or housewarming.

            "input": "I caught a fish, this big! . In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.    If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.    The first chapter is written in a maudlin, \"those-were-the-good-old-days\" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say \"Erin Go Braugh\" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.    Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as \"It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism,\" or \"they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism.\" These \"Morris mind-reads\" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.    Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!    But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.    Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.    Benjamin Franklin said \"Statistics is a liar.\" Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.    Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in \"Moby Dick,\" we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: \"I caught a fish this big!\"    There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.    In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!",

A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting.

I chose this book for my second read on this subject because it has the highest ratings (on subject) on Amazon.  Heinberg has done a thorough job of discussing every aspect of the coming problems to society due to a lack of petroleum - most of which I had never considered.  Literature about this are from the point of view of either the politician, the economist, or the geologist.  He takes the view of the geologist and the future does not look good.      I hold a more positive view: that human ingenuity will prevail - but I could easily be wrong.  In any case, this is a worthwhile read for anyone.  Of particular interest is the chapter that deals with alternate energy sources.  The next time you read about an alternate energy source in the news, you'll remember the real pro's and con's from an expert.    Quick synopsis of 41 page alternative fuel chapter from \"Party's Over:\"    Natural Gas:  Cannot be shipped from overseas easily like oil - is more difficult to extract economically every year - is being depleted like oil.  In view of the precarious status of North American gas supplies, any attempt to shift to NG as an intermediate fuel would waste time and capital in the enlargement of an infrastructure that will soon be obsolete.    Coal:  Shortage not so much a problem, however, its EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) and pollution are a problem.  As the richer seams are exhausted, it may cease to be a useful energy source within only 2-3 decades.    Nuclear:  Electricity from existing nuclear plants is inexpensive, but only if direct costs are considered.  When adding in plant construction, safety, reactor decommissioning, and waste storage - nuclear power is very expensive indeed.  There are currently 442 reactors operating worldwide.  France in the only country in Europe still building them.  Only Asia expects to expand significantly.  Only a few of the highly touted fast breeder reactors have been built, and they have proven to be prohibitively expensive.  The US currently processes enough uranium to fuel existing US reactors for the next 40 years.  The mining process is wasteful, polluting, and dangerous. When all things are considered, the EROEI on nuclear energy is fairly low and there is significant intangible downside.    Wind:  Of all renewables  (not depletable), wind power usage on a global scale is being developed the fastest.  Technology has advanced - it no longer kills birds because it uses slower fan speeds and the fans are mounted on a vertical axis. It can operate in more variable wind speeds and the cost is declining rapidly.  Soon your own equipment could be bought and used on your own property.  Wind has the best EROEI and Germany leads the world in its usage.  On a large scale, wind power would require vastly new infrastructure, but it is the most practical alternative so far.    Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.     Solar:  Technology advancing rapidly, photovoltaic the best so far.  Research is advancing into diverse methods of collection, including such easy methods of application as solar buckyball collectors incorporated into house paint.  Tremendous potential, would need new infrastructure.  Problem: cannot easily be converted to fuel transportation and agricultural needs.    Hydrogen:  For now, the process of hydrogen production always uses more energy than the resulting hydrogen will yield.  For one thing, hydrogen is not an energy source, but an energy carrier.  It's production depends on continued usage of the dwindling supply of natural gas.   There is new technology, however, and reason to be optimistic.  As with wind and solar, a whole new infrastructure, requiring time and investments of huge amounts of money and energy technology are necessary.   Like wind and solar, hydrogen fuel cells should be central features of our plans to phase out petroleum.  We should be dramatically increasing these investments.    Hydroelectric:  In many regions of the world - and especially in the US - it is already thoroughly exploited.    Geothermal power, tides, and waves: limited application in limited regions of the world.    Biomass: wood burning - pollution and limited resources in a world with 6 billion people - imagine the world being one big Easter Island.    Ethanol: costs more energy to produce than it eventually delivers to society.  Brazil is the poster child, but is burning down rain forests to grow sugar cane.    Cold-Fusion: pseudoscience    Conservation - Efficiency and Curtailment:  Will be crucial in cushioning impacts from the depletion of oil.

Kenichi has a clear description of the biggest factors (the 3 C's) impacting your success in business - the company, the competition,and the customer/consumer.  If you look at innovation in this context, Kenichi is actually also helping us innovators define \"what success looks like\": the product/technology the company makes, how technically different or better it is than competitive benchmarks or alternatives in the marketplace, and whether conusmers like it and want it.  On the projects I have worked on, advised others on, or simply observed the ones that make consistently hit at least all 3 of these deliverables and often additional deliverables to.

The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works.  Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.    I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others.  So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since.  This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.    In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)    Bottom Line:  I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  These are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests",

In fact, I only saw one reference to a cupcake from a regular layer cake recipe, even though it is written by one of the owners of New York's famed Magnolia Bakery, which has gained notoriety for its cupcakes.  At any rate, the recipes contained in this book are pure magic.  So far I have made the white layer cake with chocolate chips and peanut butter icing (as suggested), and it was quite a hit with friends and family.  Other recipes I'm going to try in the next few days are the sour cream coffee cake and the buttercup golden layer cake.  This book is all about making things from scratch like they did in the olden days, but you could also mix and match homemade cakes with store-bought icing or vice-versa.  Read the introductory section with tips and pay attention to the details (e.g., use cake flour instead of all-purpose or self-rising, use butter/sour cream at room temp., etc.), which will make all the difference.  The section with icing recipes is short but covers a variety of flavors.  It's definitely not an Atkins-friendly cookbook or any of that, so you know it's good for your sweet tooth!  I would definitely recommend this book to any baker, novice or expert, and am looking forward to buying 'The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook' (co-authored by Appel) next",

She deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel. She does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one.    When I started reading this book I thought I was going to like it a lot more than I did in the end; I thought Stephen as a child was an adorable little gentleman and I liked the relationship between her parents and how it influenced her life. When I reached her first girlfriend, however, a married woman named Angela Crossby, I was at the edge of the abyss without knowing it.    I realize this book is a product of its time, but never in my life have I heard so many cliches and stereotypes about lesbians - sorry, inverts - from a woman who was a lesbian herself. Inverts have terrible nerves. Inverts wrongly cling to religion. A \"real\" female invert is masculine and a \"real\" male invert is feminine, whereas their \"normal\" lovers are truly heterosexual.    More drama and angst are crammed into the last few chapters of the book than I would have thought possible, and the ending - which I will not reveal - comes out of nowhere and contradicts the personalities of Stephen and her lover Mary as they have been previously established. Anyone with an interest in queer literature should read this to satisfy their curiousity, and to deepen their appreciation for better-written and more realistic fiction.

            "input": "A valid and persuasive discussion . Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern.     It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty.     By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, \"It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions.\" (P.26)      From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of \"unmaking\". It can be characterized as a rejection of all \"metanarratives\" or \"grandnarratives\"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the `canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical \"anti\" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: \"...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation.\" (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991)     In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times \"cult-like\" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a \"grand-narrative\" to keep us chained.     For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation.    He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well.    This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory.",

Most still consider it a pretty fair Heinlein yarn, and yet all the reviews I read missed one of the main points of the novel--which is the main reason why it's so interesting--whether it's a great Heinlein novel or not.    Many have already commented on the various themes of the book, most of which will already be familiar to Heinlein fans. The one that was new was the bigotry against the main character, an artificial and genetically enhanced human. It seems most readers found this reaction unlikely, although this theme pervades the entire work. One reviewer asserts that it's even the primary idea of the whole book.     Another important theme is the revolt against authority which many Heinlein readers will certainly know from his other books such as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Double Star, Citizen of the Galaxy, Stranger in a Strange Land, Sixth Column, Revolt in 2100, and others.    The theme of the competent man also takes center stage in this book, another famous and familiar Heinlein theme, although in this book it's a competent, genetically enhanced female.    However, all these interpretations, although true, miss one very important point. In Heinlein's novels, the world is often a very unstable and even dangerous place--but there is always hope, and optimism that conditions will be better in the future. Often the main characters in Heinlein's books are intimately involved in this struggle to overthrow oppressive governments--and usually succeeding, thereby creating a better life for themselves.    So no matter how precarious and dark life in the present might be, Heinlein always had hope for the future and seemed confident that humans would throw off the yoke of oppression, establish a better society, and basically good would win out over evil. But in this novel, he appears to have at least partly, perhaps substantially, abandoned that hope in favor of a much darker, more dismal, and depressing future for humanity, at least on earth. Better prospects can be found off-planet on several newly colonized worlds.    The evidence for this isn't hard to find, but is scattered throughout the book in various narratives, and in conversations between Friday and her boss, Dr. Baldwin. By the way, Kettle Belly Baldwin has not appeared, to my knowledge, in another Heinlein book since Gulf, published in 1949. However, all of the other characters are new. So one of the charms of the book is that one gets to meet a lot of new characters, making this book different from almost all of Heinlein's later output, and an old but memorable character is brought back to life in a new context.    But getting back to my point, Heinlein makes it clear the earth is economically and politically deteriorating, with most of the world now completely Balkanized into hundreds of small, petty states, each with its own unpleasant idiosyncrasies. Heinlein says most of these small states are faceless ciphers, with a few larger, powerful states remaining.     The U.S. is no different, being divided into several smaller sovereign states, along with Canada. But these smaller states are often co-belligerants or are at war with each other. It's said that peace rarely lasts more than a month. In one coup that occurs in the Chicago Imperium by militant Republicans, Democrats are rounded up and executed--including their children down to the age of 14.    Another alarming idea is that the large international corporations, such as IBM or the Shipstone Corp., are also participants and instigators of these wars, and sometimes wipe out entire cities, such as Acapulco. These corporations are hard to fight, since they have no single geographical location, and in the book, the internationals seem to be winning over the real or geographically \"localized\" countries. These super corporations are completely ruthless and immoral and killing for hire and mass murder by them are common.    Heinlein holds out little hope the situation will ever improve--he sees elected officials as venal and corrupt parasites feeding at the public trough and mouthing fatuous platitudes for consumption by an impotent and perhaps naive public--a much darker and more cynical interpretation of politics than that portrayed in Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, or Double Star, in which, if I remember correctly, one character remarks that politics is the only game a mature man can take any pleasure in.    Even con artists and grifters Heinlein sees as more noble--at least they're hardworking independents who aren't on the dole and are trying to earn an \"honest\" living. :-)  Government and personal corruption are also ubiquitous. The police are not to be trusted in the book, and disposing of them if possible is considered a good idea--as long as one can get away with it, of course. For a client who is powerful and wealthy enough, even physicians can be made to arrange for a certain patient to \"die\" on the operating table. In fact, almost no one in any position of authority--except Friday's boss, Baldwin, seems to be trustworthy.    In conversations with her boss, Dr. Baldwin, he tells Friday she needs to get off planet because of what's happening on earth and asks her how one can tell if a society is truly sick--that being when normal conventions of politeness and manners have deteriorated into rudeness--which the people now take as a sign of strength. In the book, the good people always seem to be on the run and are persecuted--while the evil flourish unhindered. An epidemic of cholera or bubonic plague that could kill millions is predicted, possibly because of a conspiracy. But Baldwin sees this as a social good since cities are so overpopulated and dysfunctional already that thinning out the population--however it is achieved--is a worthwhile goal.    So overall, it seems a darker and more pessimistic future than anything Heinlein had ever imagined up to this time. But one of Heinlein's strengths is his ability to create believable alternate realities--which again comes through here--however dark and depressing it might be. Whether it's one of his greatest books or not, I think it counts as an unusual and worthwhile Heinlein book because of that",

            "input": "The return of cruelty and oppression . The brave Anna Politkovskaya reveals the reality of Russia today in this sad, sometimes horrifying book. After a brief window period of freedom under Yeltsin, Russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption, oppression and deception under Putin.     Politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura. For example Nina Levurda, who in trying to establish the truth about her son's death in the Chechen War, became a victim of this system that when not cruel, is completely indifferent to the individual. This and other cases are discussed in the chapter My Country's Army And Its Mothers.     In Russia, people imitate the man at the top, thus Putin is the one who shapes Russian society. It is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus. There are sections dealing with war criminals, brutality against privates in the military, government complicity in crime, the corruption in the judiciary, the struggle to survive in places like Kamchatka, and racism against people with a non-Slavic appearance.     Russia's stability is of a monstrous type, where power means everything, few people hold the law in any regard, bribes keep business and the state running, and a free press has almost disappeared. Putin's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records, unheard of even under Yeltsin or the Communists. As a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel, he has the mentality of a Soviet secret policeman. The Yukos affair and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man Putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism.     This process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout Putin's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second. The Western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in Russia. It is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media. Mercifully there are still people like Politkovskaya and Lev Ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out. This disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references.",

But Stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy.  He'd much rather get his hands permanently on the 5 million.  Knowing he'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law, he takes on as partners Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.  Two lifelong friends who know their way around both the Far East and other people's money.  By the time he gets to Manila, Stallings finds that he has four partners, not two.

Out on the Rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue.  There's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up.  In fact, about two thirds of the way through, the complications start to get a bit out of hand.  And that is the book's main flaw.

I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.    Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.    Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as \"harken\" rather than \"hearken\"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention",

After reading Interview with the Vampire, and the other Vampire Chronicles before Merrick, I was highly disappointed over this book. The action and references to Voodun were vague and boring. The book revolves around a plot concocted by David Talbot and Louis the Vampire to use Merrick in order to contact the ghost of Claudia. Then, the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of Merrick Mayfair, a character Anne Rice fails to develop as a complex individual. The action in this book is cheesy, typical, and EXTREMELY predictable. The book introduces characters that are related to Merrick, and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader. The vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious, yet dangerous, and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels. The vampires in Merrick, especially Louis, are portrayed as weak and gutless. Yes, Louis is a tortured soul, but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel, and his weak nature is irritating to read about. Compare the vampires in Merrick to the same vampires portrayed in Queen of the Damned, like the characters of Akasha and Kayman, who enjoyed \"devouring the marrow from their victims' bones\". The vampires in Anne Rice's previous books captured the reader's attention with their viciousness, and vengeaful, yet human qualities. Anne Rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel Merrick as she did in her others. The action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction. The book is also full of references to David's annoying, perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales. Skip this novel, and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles, preferrably her early novels. This just does not cut it",

Farrell centers his tale around the Blackett and Webb conglomerate based on rubber plantations, but extends to wide-ranging export-import business. Singapore was created to be a trading center for the British Empire and it succeeded beyond any reasonable expectations.     As war edges closer the air of unreality gets thicker. Even when the Japanese attack Malaya in late 1941, these people just don't get it. Singapore Grip explores this world in detail and from many different perspectives. The higher in the colonial hierarchy, the harder it is for reality to penetrate. Walter Blackett, scion and head delusionist is still planning the company's 50th Jubilee while the Japanese are bombing the island and even Singapore town proper.     `Singapore Grip' is a vignette in what Huxley called \"the descending road of modern history\". The war gathers slowly, life begins to change, but not dramatically at first. But, the vise inexorably tightens and the world of the characters crumbles under the relentless pressure. Escape from the island seems at first an absurd idea, but it gradually becomes ever more desirable until it finally becomes impossible in the crush at the quays.     If you are tempted to turn away from this book, don't. `Singapore Grip' gathers force and clarity as Farrell slowly adds the pieces to his masterful mosaic and the reader is duly rewarded. The book has been recently reprinted in the excellent New York Review of Books Classics series. Highly recommended.",

Starting with raw lumber and simple hand tools, Larry Pardey takes us, step by laborious step, on the odyssey of building a truly world class cruising yacht, his 30' Taleisin.  Not only is every step of the hull construction detailed, but we also get \"real world\" time and cost estimates so there are no illusions as to how much time and money each step will take.  There are superb \"pro and con\" treatments of aspects that have a variety of solutions.  If there are multiple ways to tackle a job, he makes two columns and discusses the pros and cons of each in detail.  Usually you just get the author's opinions without any extra information.    This book is famous also because of it's very important final appendix on epoxies in salt water craft, and how epoxy often is weakened to the point of failure by salt water, repeated stress, and heat - 3 things that a sailboat gets plenty of.  I am told by many epoxy fans that this chapter \"is now out of date\", but I don't remember any amazing new epoxies coming out that make Pardey's findings defunct.  George Buehler says it best - epoxy works best when it's backed up by a bolt.  \"Praise epoxy but pass the nails\".    Also note the title \"The Hull\".  That's all you get.  When it comes to decks, houses, rigging, etc., you're on your own.  Hopefully Pardey will bring out volume 2 on the rest of the boat.      He's a masterful carpenter and his work is glorious and gleaming, fully among the best of yacht-quality work ever done.  This is something you need to seriously soak in.  This is THE BEST, and not necessarily realistic for the average home boat builder.  This book represents a set of skills that you probably don't have, and may find difficulty developing in your lifetime, unless you are really dedicated.  Also, there is the time factor.  It's one thing to look at a photo of fastening planking on the frame and say \"I understand that...I can do that!\" and it's quite another to realize how many HUNDREDS of hours are involved in just a few of the aspects of the hull construction.  Pardey could work on his yacht full time - he didn't need to do other work to pay the bills.  He was also in the prime of his health.  Most Americans only have this kind of time if they're retired, and that often means not as strong as we once were.  If we're young and strong it means we have to work for a living.  So, this particular boat might be best aimed at the youngish man who doesn't have to work very much for his living.  Either that or you'll spend about a decade of weekends on this boat.      If you want to get on the water a little quicker than that, consider George Buehler's \"Backyard Boat Building\", for salty and sea worthy crusising yachts that the average man or woman can build themselves in a year or two, and actually take to the Caribbean, or further.  I'm not saying don't aspire to Pardey's level, but remember that you live in the real world.  It's better to build a simple boat than to not build a fancy one.  It's better to go sailing than it is to spend your free weekends for 2 years screwing down teak decking.  But, that consideration aside, there is no better guide to traditional yacht construction than this",

A new resurgence in the 60s, comic books were exciting again, carrying into the 70s spurred by superhero AND horror/mystery comics. Bottoming out again in the eighties, this time the culprit- video games.   Today the enemies, television and gaming, are still with us vieing for our time. Comics are not truly accessable to the buying public. They've become the property of an exclusive club that seems to revel mostly in some artist's wet dreams. How nice to know they can excercise his or her artistic rights and freedom. But no one is buying it! It's dead for all intents and purposes. Comic shops have to fill their shelves with collectible toys to make it.  The comics I buy are at liest more than 30 years old. The new ones just are not interesting and even with all of this self-examination and navel probing, the quality just isn't there. It's my opinion that it doesn't have to read like Shakespear and look like Rembrant to be a good comic. But it must entertain.  The effort has been underway for years to leave the lowly comic book in the dust, replaced by the Graphic Novel. All in the name of impoving (the perception anyway) of the comic book market! Even HBOs Tales From the Crypt\" opening credits state 'Adapted from the comic MAGAZINE...'   The internet will not save comic books. It isn't a 'book' in the first place. Illegal downloading will kill it. Scanning comic books is already a problem.  The salvation of the medium is in the hands of something that is not real? If you cannot hold it and carress it in your hands like a lover then it will not satisfy (oops, better watch my own dreaming!). I do have a love affair with comic books.  The only salvation I believe are two things:   1) Comic books must be put back into the public eye through stores or what have you. Recruitment to comic books through casual 'walk by' customers who are not necessarily seeking out comics, they just happen upon them out in public stores. Yes, the great unwashed and 'unenlightend' masses parting with their three bucks is the only thing that will help save the comicbooks!  2) The superhero must die! And artists and writers must excercise self control or face the imposition of a new comics code",

Who does not make use of drawings of segments and  rectangles enclosed in one another, when it is required to prove with  perfect rigor a difficult theorem on the continuity of functions or the  existence of points of condensation?&quot; (from his famous address at the  1900 International Congress). This book is a collection of well over 100  one-page proofs, collected from various sources. The topics range from  number theory to calculus, and most of them require no advanced  mathematics. Typically there is a statement of a result, with a labelled  diagram showing how it is &quot;proved&quot;; in some cases there are a few  auxiliary equations along with the picture. These are not simple, often  requiring quite a bit of thought before the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment.  Working through them is a valuable exercise for the student of  mathematics--having seen, e.g., six different visual proofs of the  Pythagorean theorem, one comes to really *understand* the result, not just  &quot;follow the logic&quot;. I have not encountered any better way than  this book to &quot;see&quot; how mathematical truth is discovered and  proved. It can be valuable as a supplement to courses through precalculus  and elementary calculus.

            "input": "Sadist On The High Seas . Joan Druett adds her name to the growing list of authors who have, in the last few years, tackled the topic of seafaring misadventure. We have had several excellent entries in this genre, including Nathaniel Philbrick's \"In The Heart Of The Sea\" and Mike Dash's \"Batavia's Graveyard.\" Joan Druett's book is not quite on the level of those two books- they are \"richer\" in their narrative drive and complexity- but \"In The Wake Of Madness\" is still a good, solid \"read.\" The author points out that at the time of the mutiny on the whaleship \"Sharon,\" people who were not on board the ship assumed that the South Sea Islanders who killed Captain Howes Norris did so because they were \"cannibals\" and \"heathens.\" The people who had direct knowledge of the events preceding the mutiny did nothing to dispel this notion- to do so would have raised questions concerning their own active or passive complicity in Norris's actions and could have damaged the careers of some highly ambitious ships' officers. It turns out that Captain Norris had, over a long period of time, systematically beaten and abused an 18 year old crew member (and apparent fugitive slave) named George Babcock. A combination of floggings and backbreaking labor finally resulted in the death of Babcock. Worse still, it appears that Norris knew, way before the final denouement, that his actions would result in Babcock's death. It was the result he was looking for. Druett speculates on the motivation(s): racism, anger/fear (Norris had had trouble keeping control over his crew on a prior voyage on a different ship), frustration (the \"Sharon\" was having very bad luck finding and catching whales), etc. Of course, harsh discipline was nothing unusual on board ships at the time. But Norris seems to have been especially brutal, even by 19th century standards. Babcock at one point tried to get help from his fellow crewmembers, as he feared for his life. His mates did try to protect him, before finally yielding to the authority of the captain and his officers. Why did the officers support the captain? We have to remember that a captain was sovereign of his ship. Going against his wishes could result in being branded a mutineer...not exactly good for your career. In any event, it appears that the South Sea Islanders who killed Captain Norris were either similarly abused or felt that, given enough time, they would suffer the same fate as Babcock. \"In The Wake Of Madness\" works as both an adventure story- as Mrs. Druett describes the recapture of the \"Sharon\" by her crew- and as something broader- as we learn a bit about the day-to-day operation of a whaling ship and of the cultural dynamics that came into play when New England whalers met Pacific Islanders. Stopping off at the islands was a bit like playing \"Russian Roulette.\" On some islands, the natives were very friendly and would provide women and food for trade goods (although they did have a propensity for stealing anything made of iron that wasn't nailed down). On other islands you could run into cannibals or natives who would murder the crew and steal the ship. Not infrequently, some crewmembers who felt misused would jump-ship at some friendly port-of-call and \"go native\" or try to \"sign-on\" with another whaling ship with a more easy-going captain. We also learn a little about life back home on Martha's Vineyard. The book seems a bit abrupt and frantically paced, with Mrs. Druett attempting to juggle all this in only 230 pages. Still, this is a generally well-written, interesting book, and worth your time",

So, while the bibliographies for same are useful, they also are selectively chosen.

To my surprise, the public library had more books on writing than the college library. I thought to myself, \"I've been looking for these kind of books to enhance my writing!\" So I grasped this book in my hands and began reading away. As I continued through this book, I began to notice the editorial commas. I slowly connected the truth of the book's title to the content of the book: This was a book based around press and media writing. I found a nice and quiet place to read at the library's local history room and then sat down near a desk.    While reading, I decided to give this book a review, so I wrote down notes in a notebook. However, my logic and learned way of writing may or may not conflict with one from the press; but I felt that errors and other press related style and/or punctuation was not pointed out soon enough. Therefore, I was confused as to the difference between press writing and academic writing, and may have created a biased review. I would have liked the differences pointed out. Please don't smack me with the stupid stick for having errors in this review: I'm still working on my English. With that being said, onto the online *evil smirk* book review.    E-mail vs. email:    As much as I admire a businessman becoming a writer for The Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, he forgot one thing: E stands for electronic! Instead of being 1337, he went on this long rant about being an \"oldbie\" on the web and a javaslinger; he coded his first page in raw HTML (javascript). I'm oldschool, but at least I understand why it was called \"e-mail.\" Something that I found silly was his inability to appeal to authority. Let me ask you something: If the owner of eBay were to write up a report about his or her company and list the company's name multiple times through the report, then would you accept that as the correct spelling? I would. Case closed. Appeal to creator wins.    Possible error at the top paragraph on page 59: \"The first example, however, places 'and added' in a parallel position; thus the 'and added' clause is made dependent on the...\"    Let's look at the semicolon and the word \"thus\".    Last time I checked, a person is suppose to use a comma after and independent marker; thus, a comma comes after 'thus'. Is the missing comma suppose to be some type of Associated Press (AP) writing editorial punctuation? You could smack me with a stick for not reading the AP style guide, but it would have been nice if the author and the copyeditors noted what was going on. Some of the material and possible errors at this point make me question if I should continue reading the book. I looked up semicolon in the index, and it was about 30 or so pages ahead of the past page I was at. I noticed the semicolon was feared by the author and not brought out in detail. I'm not chuckling. I've questioned a few of the matters in this book. I've been able to accept press vs. academic so far, but I'm starting to get concerned if what I'm learning is correct or not. I grabbed the book from the library to learn. However, if these are mistakes, then I'm a novice writer learning mistakes that weren't meant to be mistakes. I don't think that's a good way to learn how to write. Do you?    Let's go to the their vs. his or her debate:    I don't care who or what you are, I'm going to use his or her. If something is singular, it's going to stay that way. I don't approve of the media or some other brainwashing superpower to change the rules of English grammar. This is why I've got to love some of the reviews on Amazon.com. People don't seem to care about grammar. Makes me feel like someone is trying to sell me snake oil and the people around me are conspiring with the retailer. Apparently, I'm not the only one that feels this way. Not after reading the rest of the reviews here. May I mention that Amazon.com was advertised in the book? Yeah. Thanks for dumbing down grammar.    Another section was where he used a comma instead of a semicolon to creates sentences like the following:    Page 91:  I like Trix, I like Lucky Charms, and I like Cocoa Pebbles.    Maybe I'm missing something here; maybe he was trying to detail something; maybe he's ADHD and forgot; and maybe the book is ADHD.    I like Trix, Lucky Charms, and Cocoa Pebbles.  Thank you parallelism.    A person is suppose to use a semicolon instead of this serial comma junk he's selling; however, this could be a style concern. Another entry about style and its concerns with semicolons could have been inserted.    Yeah. I'm done reading after 60 pages or so. At least I read more than a fifth of the book.    Parts of the book I liked:    Introduction to brackets. It may not have been correct, but I understand what it's about.    \"I've written a stylebook that I hope makes the following point: Be skeptical of stylebooks.\"    You seem to have accomplished your goal: Your book makes me borderline schizophrenic",

Even in paperback this is a thick and heavy book, which is a compilation of several of MKF Fisher's individual works offering different aspects of her thoughts on food in terms of origin, recipes, culinary preparation, and history. In addition, it divulges her own observations on the whole dining experience that we as humans go through in terms of customs, etiquette, ambience, socializing and so forth. But what makes this book stellar is the eloquent, imaginative, and sometimes even haunting style of Ms. Fisher's writing. She expresses her own thoughts and oftentimes outspoken opinions, mixing them with historical facts, tempting recipes, and home-cooked tales. With such a satisfying horn of plenty within the confines of two book covers, it is easy to understand why she still reigns as the queen of prose inspired by food and dining. I wish I had her ability to master in writing such joi de vivre and enthusiasm for food, eating, and drinking, which after all are such basic elements to our very existence.      The section I enjoyed most of all was \"The Gastronomical Me\", a biography-cum-travelogue in which she poignantly narrates her experiences by rendering them so lifelike that you can smell the smells and taste the tastes. She includes food episodes of her early years in California while growing up and later attending boarding school; in Dijon, France where the kitchens in restaurants and her apartments beckon you to partake of the offerings; in Switzerland where you visually can grasp the mountains and streams along train-rides she describes through the Alps to Italy; and finally in a small Mexican town, where she surpasses even the writing prowess demonstrated in her previous stories, by telling the most poignant tales.     An interesting sidelight is that this book not only covers food. You gather early on that she is far from a teetotaler since alcoholic drinks and drinking at mealtimes too are frequent topics, from sipping wines and champagnes and glasses of Pernod on ocean liners to mixing water with bourbon, which she keeps in a flask during a long, propeller-driven, airplane flight to Mexico.     The other sections I liked were the beginning (Serve It Forth) and Consider the Oyster. It amazed me that one person could write a whole expose covering around a hundred pages about only the oyster: the various types, methods of preparations, and culinary history. Plus she gives her own personal memories and anecdotes too. You name it, she said it about oysters--recipes included.     I did not care as much for How to Cook a Wolf, as I could not relate to either the off-color humor or to some of the topics she presented. (Sorry, but sweetbreads, halves of calf heads, and brains were not appetizing subjects.) Also, I gave up finishing the book. I started to read \"An Alphabet for Gourmets\", the last section, but got as far as \"D\" and couldn't force myself to read through the rest of the alphabet. It seems to me by the time in her life when she wrote this section she had become rather cynical and bitter, to the extent that everything she wrote sounded condescending. This section was such a let-down, a depressant to me after coming off the high of \"The Gastronomical Me\". Although I exaggerate, she seemed to repeatedly state something to the effect that she preferred to dine alone on crackers and milk rather than face gourmet meals with uncultivated people (with untrained palettes) who were unsavvy as to the proper way food should be eaten in the first place and incapable of appreciating what they shoved in their faces in the second. Anyway, other readers may disagree with me, but this last section lacks the consistency, and more important, the vibrancy and pep of her flowing, off-the-wall style that grows on you in the other sections.      Although I was a little disheartened at the end, her brilliance that shone through in the other sections more than outweighed the few negatives.  I can recommend this book to everyone, especially to people who are interested in food as a literary subject in its own right instead of something that we simply cook and eat. Of course, foodies and cooks alike should appreciate it. And though it does have some very good recipes as added bonuses, this should not be considered a cookbook; instead, this book's function is to serve up delicious tidbits for our minds and imaginations to savor and enjoy.",

It was Kane and Abel and after watching it for the last 22 years I have been fasinatied with that story. I did not know until 2006 that it was a book so I bought it and its sequel. I loved the Prodigal daughter although I do have some things I would have done differently. I for one who have call the book the Prodigal children with a  focus on Richard childhood as well. One of my favorite things in the novel was that while FLorentyna was a Democrat Richard was a Repulican (The good kind not the crazy ones you have today.) I guess becuase although there is around a 10-15 year age difference between the chacters and my own parents that is how they are. (My favorite scene in this is when RIchard puts a Barry Goldwater bumpersticker on their car she rips it right off. ANother one  is when RIchard after telling his wife that he did not cheat on her FLorentyna said \"You should have slept with her\" meaning RIchard's old girlfriend becuase that would have cemeted a business deal ) I also did not like fact that RIchard died and they brought in Edward WIncheaster as a second husband or that the book went into a future that never could come true. BUt then again that is nit picking. By the way a book in which a blond 60 something CHicago born woman seantor becomes the first female United States President.

Also, I must mention the humor.  The chuckle is there, right after the sadness or the disaster.      Traveling from Bulgaria to Moscow, from Stalinist Russia to a Spain steeped in civil war, Furst offers Bolshevists, the NKVD, defenders of the Republic, partisans, and on and on.

Because it is such a profound book, parts of it may at times seem confusing. Many times I struggled through the pages of the Old Testament trying to comprehend the history. Sometimes I would give up, becoming weary of the long string of names or descriptions of who begat whom.     Why did God's Word have to be so difficult for me? I so wanted to be able to read the Bible and be as interested in its history as I was in the Tudor Era. Of course, I never dreamed that there was a book out there just for me.    When my Mom presented me with Adam and His Kin by Dr. Ruth Beechick I immediately devoured it. The story, the history, the Bible! Mrs. Beechick retells the story of Genesis like no other author has. I found myself intrigued and delighted as I read about Eve's heartbreaking struggle in the Garden of Eden, the tragic murder of Abel, the fascinating story of Noah, and even the tower of Babel.    It was like reliving history beside these amazing figures and the spectacular events which surrounded them. I could actually feel Eve's longing for the forbidden, I mourned for Noah as he was made fun of and taunted while he built the most amazing boat in the world, the boat that God instructed him to build.   In Adam and His Kin history comes to life and you experience what life was like thousands of years ago. In my opinion, this book is a masterpiece and I can give it nothing but the highest praise.

I very much agree that it is important for clients to be able to guide their own work, but I am also highly aware of the ways people with BPD can split different providers.  There are just too many GENUINELY therapeutic reasons to approach the author's recommendations with caution to allow what he says to interrupt what may very well be extraordinary work between a therapist and client.

Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements.  She includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias (even though they say they don't)...this book should be on everyone's must read list!!",

After reading the book Medicine Woman and the San Francisco Review of Books on the back which says this is an Autobiographical I have to question a few things.

The last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in Manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods.

The writing is much clearer than many Asian master's first works in English. The layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text. Content includes budo (martial arts) history, jujutsu, kenjutsu, and samurai tradition. The nito-ken (two-sword) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts. Basic, intermediate, and advanced Honmon Enshin Ryu applications are well laid out, with many okuden (secret) mastry level techniques portrayed. The focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari (spear), naginata (halberd), bo (staff), and shuriken (throwing star) as well. There is also a bit of muto dori (no sword) techniques covered as well.    The author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively. Tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956, achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo, 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo, 5th dan in Bojutsu, and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments. While you cannot learn any martial art solely from a book, this work is an excellent place to learn about these systems or augment your dojo training. Highly recommended!

Alison McGhee's story is about 17 year-old Rose surviving a collision in which she and her older sister, Ivy, were innocent  victims. Rose agonizes throughout Ivy's lengthy hospitalization, and the accident is replayed over & over; also the mother's 'coping mechanisms' - keeping her hands busy while her mind and heart cannot allow the release of Ivy from the hospital's life lines.    This is a  heart-wrenching story, like a movie that must be seen again and again  -  my reading became skimming at times: I identified Rose as a middle-schooler & didn't want her story to tell young girls that sex is a good release from the agony of being alive; nor is it safe, or without other consequences. (I was never comfortable about the time our daughters spent on the school bus!) McGhee's characters became a part of my life, not to  be sloughed off easily.

Reviewer mcHAIKU agrees with the judges for Minnesota's 2006 Book Awards that the author's \"poetic text authentically and movingly reflects the thoughts and actions of a teen who is desperately trying to salvage her life.\" Alison McGhee's writing, and the characters that developed strengths, the quotes which melded to become prime movers for the telling , and the friends who cultivated the writer's talents - - all are to be admired.

By treating Christianity and concepts like being \"born again\" as metaphors, he tries to escape the problem of having to defend the actual truth of Christianity.

It is about three men , Israel Carmi , Jochanan Pelz and Arie Pinchuk, who form the Jewish Brigade , a division of Jewish soldiers from Israel, in the British army-\"the first official Jewish fighting force since the fall of the Judea to the Roman legions\". At the time when Jews are being victimized and lead like sheep to the slaughter , the Jewish Brigade , with a yellow Star of David emblazoned to their uniform , fighting for the Jewish people , and their homeland of Israel, shows the world that Jews can fight back and win.  It also tells the remarkable story of Arie Pichuk's sister Leah , and her escape from the Nazis , surviving as a fugitive in the Ukraine , before joining  the anti-Nazi Partisans.  After the war , the men witness first hand what the Nazis have done to their people, and set off on a course of identifying , finding and killing Nazi officers who have participated in the holocaust.  Their hatred and ferocity threatens to overwhelm them , until a chance encounter with an orphaned Jewish girl sets them on a more constructive course-smuggling Jewish boys and girls into Israel, despite the British blockade which tires to prevent Jews from entering the ancient homelnd from which they where forced out by the Romans two thousand years before.  It is therefore a true narrative about the re-establishment of the State of Israel , where Jewish children can grow up insafety and live as free men and women , in a free homeland of their own.  That is Zionism , which has been so maligned by evil forces , who want the Jews to fall pray to genocide again.  Every descent person , Jew or Gentile , needs to dedicate themselves to ensuring that Israel survives as a Jewish State in which Jews can live freely and safely.  Anything else will guarantee another holocaust.  Israel and the Jewish people are faced with the same genocidal hate today , that the Jews where faced with during World War II  Our heroes play a role in defending Israel after the fledgling state is attacked by five Arab armies , hellbent on genocide.

            "input": "mind opener . I first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection. From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole.    So the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read.    Having read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male.    Also, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male.    It is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male.    Pinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another.    In this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape.    Though I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",

            "input": "Buyer Beware (Note: Taijiquan = Tai Chi Chuan = Taiji) . If you're familiar with the writings of Wong Kiew Kit he often states that you can't learn genuine martial arts like Taijiquan and Shaolin Kung Fu from a book.  You need to learn from a master because there are too many subtleties that will be missed without a proper instructor.  So when Wong Kiew Kit states that:     \"I have no Taijiquan lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Taijiquan masters. I mainly learned from Taijiquan classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Shaolin training.\"  Which is similar to saying:    \"I have no Shaolin lineage. I did not learn from any well-known living Shaolin masters. I mainly learned from Shaolin classics, and was able to interpret and practice what past masters had written because of my thorough Taijiquan training.\"    There's no way Wong Kiew Kit would tolerate someone claiming to be a master of Shaolin Kung Fu without having learned from a teacher belonging to a lineage.  On his website he states that:    \"Not a single person of those who have learnt Taijiquan from me complains about my lack of a Taijiquan lineage. In fact, no one seems to care about this lineage issue. On the other hand, they are satisfied that what they have leant(sic) from me is very close to the kind of Taijiquan practiced by masters in the past.\"  How are these people qualified to gauge how closely Wong Kiew Kit's Taiji compares to Taijiquan masters of the past?   Did they time travel and study under these past masters?  Or do they have a gut feeling like I have a gut feeling that I can learn Shaolin Kung Fu from a Taiji instructor?  It's quite likely that WKK is teaching a modified version of Shaolin Kung Fu that uses Taiji principles gleaned from his interpretation of the classics.      I won't deny that Wong Kiew Kit is probably Shaolin master, but there's no evidence to suggest that he is teaching an authentic form of Taiji.  He has admitted that his entire knowledge of Taijiquan has mainly come from books and scriptures, not from a living breathing human being trained in a proper lineage.  Call it whatever you want to WKK, but don't mislead people into thinking its Taijiquan.  Telling people to learn from masters and not from books and then doing it yourself is completley hypocritical.      In the end, of what value is a \"Tai Chi Chuan\" book that was written by someone who has no real \"Tai Chi Chuan\" training?    In response to a new review, let me mention a few things:    One reviewer presupposes that Taiji branched off from Shaolin, but there's so much debate about the origins of Taiji its to hard to make any concrete statements about it.    The Wikipedia page on Zhang Sanfeng states that:     \"Much of the written material about him is mythical, contradictory, or otherwise suspect. For instance, he is reported by different people to have been born either in 960, 1247, or in 1279.\"    There's almost no proof to suggest that he actually existed, or that he created Taiji out of Shaolin.  But what tends to be agreed upon is that all forms of Taiji branched off from Chen Style when Yang Lu-Chan learned the art and spread his version of Taiji (Yang Style) across China.       This reviewer and his master may have proper training in a Taiji, and I won't contest that, but as WKK explicitly states, he has none.  He seems to mistake WKK's lack of proper instruction from a Taiji master as modesty.  If  \"modesty\" is what you are looking for in a teacher, may I too be \"modest\" about my lack of proper instruction in Shaolin, and offer you my instruction; perhaps even a book about something that I have no proper instruction in.          WKK does state that you should not learn Taiji without a proper instructor, but he himself did just that.  Maybe he could provide us with the origins of his undistinguished lineage to settle the argument?      When the reviewer says that the Shaolin Temple is the \"supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history,\" it really is just a matter of opinion.  Not everyone views the Shaolin Temple in such a holy light.  Everything WKK writes in his books about the history of martial arts, the Shaolin temple and Buddhism ends up supporting his qualifications as a teacher; which is a major conflict of interest.  All the legends about Bodhidharma and Zhang Sanfeng are stated as fact without being prefaced with a warning about the highly mythical nature of their history.  He uses the iffy Taiji developing from Shaolin story to justify his lack of Taiji lineage.  If you were a prospective customer you would be highly discouraged by the whole no-lineage thing.  But when he feeds you the Taiji developing from Shaolin stuff the reader thinks, \"If Taiji developed from Shaolin, WKK must be a Master of both.\"  WKK sounds pretty great if he is the one writing the history books",

            "input": "where's the beef? . The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.    The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.    So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.      In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.    The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.    Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.    In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown \"first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory.\"  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.    The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).    The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.    Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.    The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.    The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.    Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously",

It is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners. I would advise reading \"The neatest little guide to the stock market\" before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks.    Here is a summary of his CAN SLIM method to making money in the stock market, this is how to buy stocks:  C= Current quarterly earnings:are they enough?  A=Annual earnings increases:do they have meaningful growth?  N=New products,New management,New highs:is it time to buy?  S=Supply and demand:Small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase.  L=Leader or Laggard:Only buy leaders.  I=Institutional sponsorship:A little will drive up price.  M=Market Direction=How to determine it and follow.    The final chapter is 18 common mistakes most investors make, this is excellent advice for what not to do.    This book's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or P/E ratios. He justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued, when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors.

The story is driven by Enid's desire to have her three children return home for Alfred's \"last\" Christmas.    Franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together, introducing fun moments of \"aha!\" to the reader.

Secondary characters connect primary characters together via seemingly random (yet believable) relationships.    I found this novel an interesting read, but I had a hard time getting through it.  The novel, at times, is horribly depressing.

I need to write something about this book. But what? Do I love it? Do I hate it? In the beginning I felt like quitting after every ten pages, then continuing after the next ten pages, and so on, and so on. I felt myself both repulsed and seduced. Eventually I gave in. Gave in to Nick Flynn's words, sentences, story, language, world, universe. The universe of Nick Flynn's disfunctional family: his alcoholic, delusional, absentee father and his suicidal mother, form the foundation of this memoir. In large measure it's a journey in search of his father, a man who lives by his wits, fuelled by alcohol, driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'Great American Novel' (with a million dollar advance and the Nobel prize certainties in that delusion), to eventual homelessness on the street. It's also Nick Flynn is search of himself. But it's none of the above. It's truly a work of literature that sets out, on every page, to capture, and lose, the mystery of the human condition. It's surreal, a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living. This book finds a kinship with Joyce and Beckett, and it's no wonder that Nick Flynn chooses an excerpt from Beckett's 'Endgame' to open the story: HAMM: Scoundrel! Why did you engender me? NAGG: I don't know. HAMM: What? Why didn't you know? NAGG: That it'd be you.     You will be haunted by this story long after you've finished reading it.",

I would suggest this one, although there are numerous contenders from the Jeeves, Drones, golf, Mr. Mulliner and Blandings stories, not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns.    Although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative, being that all the tales are told in the first person by one Bertie Wooster, the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat \"cliffhanger\" endings, which is to say they don't resolve.    That almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel, and also spun off some of the best TV yarns in the Jeeves and Wooster and World of Wodehouse TV series.    My British edition (for copyright reasons not for sale in the U.S.) shows a cover photo op of Ian Carmichael as Wooster in the BBC series \"The World of Wooster\". As PGW noted, this was one of many instances where Bertie was overly mature and greyed; there seems a deliberate attempt to make Carmichael seem older-- whereas most readers, Wodehouse included, see him as somewhat youngish.     In Wodehouse Playhouse, which includes brief vignettes of PGW, he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting Bertie somewhat younger. Even better was the stellar performance in Jeeves and Wooster, in which \"Pearls Mean Tears\" \"Comrade Bingo\" and a number of these other chapters, expanded into episodes, appear. No wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read",

This book really \"looks\" great but I'm not impressed by the content. So much so that it compelled me to write my first ever book review.    The introduction \"Who Is This Book For?\" gives a sense that this book can get people into programming.   I would be amazed however if anyone not familiar with programming will get past Chapter 1 without being frightened by the whole prospect of programming.  Chapter 1 initially jumps into some Microsoft marketing of .Net which really adds nothing but confuses the readers by having to deal with line after line of computer jargon.  Then the chapter gives a horrible overview of Object Orientation which again doesn't help later.    I feel the whole book is like the first chapter. Doesn't give you some of the basics but rambles about more complex stuff you don't need between some hands on practical stuff.     I actually thought the first example was really poor also.  I am of the opinion that someone typing something in themselves and seeing it work should be rewarding.  The example however was hard for a novice as it had long lines of comments and the line to print the variables was a minefield of quotes and symbols making it pretty likely that a beginner would do a typo.      The title of the book is \"Build a Program Now!\".  This the book does and given how complex setting up an environment it is helpful.

I have lost over 20 pounds since then and I have cleared up some nasty protein pools in my blood that Rob found six months ago when I started the program.  At first I was a bit skeptical and hesitant to go on the program, but after time I felt that it was working and it was great. The food - which is cooked by a good friend of my family's and is also on the Ph program - is excellent, and the program is great.  And, those jerks that attack Rob and Shelley personally are nothing but low-life jerks. Rob and Shelley are wonderful people and great friends of mine. On their retreat to Rancho Del Sol, they went so far out of their way to help me and all of the others on the retreat.  And, when you watch Rob do a live blood test, it is fascinating. He presents his findings in conferences that are followed by a great Alkaline lunch. And the findings are very interesting. He bases most of his work on the work of A. Bechamp, an 18th century scientist that was an understudy of Louis Pasture. The facts are there, and quiet fascinating. He (Rob) is brilliant, but a bit excentric. But that is understandable considering his passion for his work.  Over all, this program works. I love the alternative path way to health, but do admit that Western methods are needed at times. I just feel that you don't need to \"Dope up\" on Px drugs at the first sigh of trouble.  So I give this 5 stars not just for the program, but for Rob and Shelley as my good friends.   But...  Do this in moderation to other healthy lifestyles. Don't just go 100 percent Alkaline all of the sudden. Slowly work your way to that wanted PH and be moderate with other health practices.  So 5 stars for me.  The book presents it all. A great read on the Ph program for weight loss! But do not assume something until you have read the book. And forget what you might think about the program until you read the book and have a sound understanding of Rob's theory.  Thank you Rob and Shelley!!",

In England though she recently broke up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school, lives in a relatively happy all female home, and seems adjusted.  That is until she learns she is pregnant.    Her mom Karen is a teacher's aide struggling with her mother Nan's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming. Her patience is over the edge when Charlotte informs her she is pregnant.  Upset and unable to contain her anger, Karen cannot believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to Karen.  Though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth.  She did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward.  As Nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted Karen, the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as Charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome.    This fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother, a child having a child, the sandwich generation, and the creeping of dementia (as well as a late stroke).  When the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until Karen returns to her \"real\" family.

Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.     I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!    It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.

            "input": "\"She thinks last of her child.\" . Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, has created a successful series based on a few basic principles. The first, and in my opinion, most important aspect is a fascinating heroine, who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a tough cop, who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save. On the other hand, she is the wife of the billionaire Roarke, and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests. She has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it, she has learned to accept it. The fact that Eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case Eve faces. Her husband also has a complex past, involving an abusing father who killed Roarke's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was. Only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family.     Besides the two main characters, Robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which I consider to be the second factor in its success. Peabody is Eve's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments. She is in love with McNabb, a policeman working in the Electronic Detectives Division, and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment. There are other interesting characters: Feeney, Eve's trainer and mentor, Mavis, Eve's best friend, Nadine Furst, a reporter for Channel 75 who has become a close friend with Eve, Charles, a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor, and several others. One of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people, and that is why I recommend reading the series in order.     The third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place: New York in the year 2059. The setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world, like cars that fly, drones that take care of household chores, the ban on firearms, the anticancer vaccine, the legalization of prostitution, the difficulty for getting real coffee, etc. Also, the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes, and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries. In this novel, Eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder. The victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving, the killer took out her eyes as a memento. The poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple, and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her.    Everything is business as normal until Celina Sanchez shows up wanting to talk to Eve and claiming she has information about the murder. Celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision. Even though Eve does not really believe in this stuff, she goes along with it following Peabody's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either. This is not the first time Robb uses supernatural events in the series, but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable. In the present try the results were much better, and since the case Eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far, the overall quality of the novel benefits even more.    As usual, Robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series. Of course, the romantic scenes are still present through the narration, but without overdoing it. I was very pleased with this installment, and I am looking forward to the next one. A final word of advice, the publisher's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel. I would have preferred to read the book without knowing these facts. The good thing is that even if you read them, there will be a surprise waiting for you",

We have the story of a woman named Rachel, and her husband, Eric Leben. Eric was a doctor in genetics who was fighting with his wife until he is pushed in front of a bus, by her, and killed. Rachel felt that maybe freedom was at last hers, until hours later, Eric is missing from the morgue, and we learn the awful truth of his secret work.     I felt that this book had action from the very first few pages, and did not stop until the very last word. I was thrilled with the roller coaster of a ride that Koontz took me on, and i could not put the book down once i started on the journey. Koontz makes great use of location, and our fears of within, to give us this great chiller of the experiments of man to be more than human. A definite gem in the Koontz collection, a must have for any collector, and a great place to start for anyone taking a look at his work for the first time. A Masterpiece. My only wish of this book: It should have been made into a movie. -C",

Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's &quot;fiesty, independent and outspoken&quot;, she is repeatedly referred to as &quot;difficult to HANDLE&quot; and &quot;a real handful&quot;.  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be &quot;handled&quot;?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really &quot;met her match&quot; in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his &quot;faults&quot; to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY",

Written in his usual flowing prose, he recounts the events leading up to possibly the most catastrophic natural disaster to date in American history.     On May 31, 1889 the dam at the South Fork fishing and hunting club burst following torrential rains of some 6-8 inches. His vivid description of the aftermath, death and suffering is chilling. He provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least.     The events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well. The South Fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite Americans (e.g. Carnegie). The club was situated up the valley from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster. Many argued that it's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains. The dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event. Many joked about it, but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely.    Following a late Spring holiday parade in 1889, the \"impossible\" occured. The dam gave way, and the lake entered the valley, sweeping locomotives, train tracks, woods, houses, stores along with it. Entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to Johnstown. The death toll was some 2200. McCullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath. The corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat, with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster.     The blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the South Fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve. It's a tale of early conspicuous consumption, and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything.    Along the way, McCullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings. The development steel mills, railroads, refineries, labor conditions, and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of Johnstown.    Also, details of death counts at the make shift morgues, financial support during the aftermath (President Harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $300.00) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader. Eerie recounts of coroners' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl.    Clara Barton began organizing the American Red Cross in 1881. She had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889. Her work at Johnstown earned her dinner with the President Harrison in Washington following her five months of pure dedication in Johnstown.    This is a fantastic book. The Katrina disaster sparked my interest and I was not disappointed. If only Clara Barton were head of the Red Cross during the Katrina aftermath..",

He's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character.  He's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path.  I'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago.  It's so graphic and unapologetic for Tarzan's bestial nature.    That said, there are a few small flaws.  Elements of the plot can be a bit contrived, but since it usually serves to get to more action, I can forgive that.  Burroughs's writing, while still engaging, is a little stilted by today's standards.  And it doesn't end with Tarzan getting Jane.  That's the story of \"The Return of Tarzan\".    Not ending in a book ALWAYS bugs me.  I hate cliffhangers.  I don't need to be blackmailed to read the next one.  You can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others.

Her superior attitude is unearned and unwarranted -- what gives this 27-year-old the right to lord herself over those with more experience and aptitude?  Another reviewer compared Brue's writing to Bill Bryson.  I have news for you -- Bryson has a sense of wit and humor as he vivisects cultural (and human) anomalies.  Brue is just plain cruel and mean -- where's the fun in that (for the reader).  Shame on the editorial staff at Bloomsbury for buying into a good concept (it was a good concept) and letting it go to seed.  Brue's experiences are best left to the diary.  Instead of elevating bathing studies into the pop limelight, she sends it to the red-light district where she is infinitely more comfortable.  And the net result -- she, her readers, and her contacts all suffer from bad research and bad writing in this self-serving piece of trash best left on the beach, buried and unread",

It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over",

This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.    I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a \"guy\" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.    The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.    About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.      Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.    And yes, I read \"Lost Boy\", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.    So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.

And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know.  At least that's Herman's view.  Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves.  Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China.  They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a \"premier\" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques.  If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow?  No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss.  When historians condemn these two for their \"crime\" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly.

Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.

Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.    Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):     -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)!  -Another's family was murdered in China  -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?)  -Another lost his son to cancer  -Another's psychotic    If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)    If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try.

Searching For Caleb had a new setting every five pages, family members who walked out and wouldn't have come back until they were \"kidnapped\", and chaotic events that led to a suicide, all of which made this book interesting in an unusual way.  This book is first set on a train going to New York City in the year of 1972. Then the scene changes to Cairo Mill, Maryland. Suddenly it changes to Baltimore, Maryland in the 1800's. A bit later it changes to Baltimore in 1980. Anne Tyler told most of the story in Maryland, but at the end, she changes to Louisiana. The story was about the Peck family, which was a very sophisticated family. Wealthy, respectable, self-involved, they always wore hats.  Even the little girls never went out of the house without a hat on. Basically the story was about Daniel Peck's search for his brother, Caleb, who walked off in 1912. It was also about his granddaughter Justine Peck's realization that she will never be the Peck that she always dreamed to be. The concept of this book, then, is finding oneself.  Daniel Peck's main conflict was evident in his search for Caleb. When Caleb was in his twenties he just walked out on the family and didn't return or make contact with any family member. The search started when Daniel moved in with Duncan and Justine Peck. Daniel spent years researching and visiting people who might have known Caleb. He would visit people that were Caleb's friends or appeared in pictures with Caleb. Unfortunately, he had absolutely no luck. So when Daniel's birthday came, his oldest son \"Two\" hired him a private investigator to search for Caleb. The private investigator headed straight to work asking questions. He found out that when Caleb was younger all one would have to do to find Caleb was \"Hold still a minute and listen.\" He found out how Caleb loved music. He also went searching to Caleb's home in Baltimore.  Then the private investigator learned where Caleb was just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. The private investigator told the Pecks this but before Daniel could meet Caleb, Daniel died of a heart attack.  This book was draining yet funny; mostly draining. The hardest part was keeping track of what part the story was in, whether the past or the present.  Also the Peck family was absolutely insane. Actually two cousins ended up married to each other. That caused so much chaos that a separation, a disowning and a suicide happened over the event. Then Justine and Duncan were constantly moving because Duncan would become restless and wanted a change. Justine just went along very easily but Meg, their daughter, hated moving. She locked herself in the bathroom a few times.  Daniel did not begin looking for his brother for practically 30 years after Caleb walked out. The comical parts were the best. For instance, all the time that Daniel was searching for Caleb his old maid knew right where Caleb was. When Caleb left, he had told her where he was going. Yet she never told anyone because no one ever asked her. In addition, Duncan would cut out newspaper clippings and stick them to things.  To the old Ford that the door was torn off he stuck a clipping that said \"Wouldn't you rather have a Buick?\". When Meg bought an expensive dress, his cut out was \"Have you ever had a bad time in Levi's?\" One of Justine's neighbor was divorced and the father of her child who had no visiting rights would come and take the daughter. The mother would scream and shout about her daughter being kidnapped, yet every night the father brought the child home safe and sound.  This book was very interesting, but a strange kind of interesting.  It never really caught my attention; rather it often put me to sleep.  It was summer reading, the kind you get on a book list.  I would suggest it to people if they didn't really have anything else to read. But some will like it. I found it too scattered in place and time and too slow moving.",

After the first few chapters, I could not wait for it to end. The ultimate horror of this book is reserved for those compelled to finish any book they start.    As has been mentioned in other reviews. WE GET IT. The woods are \"SCARY\" and their presence is pervasive. The characters themselves, despite the author's intent, are also wooden, and if the reader experiences any fear, it is the fear of being infected by the banality and possible mental retardation of Heather Price and her insufferable family.     The best way to describe the story for me is this: It's a fairy tale. Its simplistic writing style and unsophisticated fear-factor could have very easily been told in 5 or 6 pages, and inserted invisibly into a volume of Grimm's. As such, it would have been a much better tale with at least the healthy moral about the hazards in spending too much time with your crazy Aunt.    As a novel, it is pure water torture. If the trees ever do revolt, useless wastes of paper such as this piece will most certainly be causative.    I asked my friend about it after I finished. He admitted it was a joke... a book he bought on a flight out to visit me, and in his words \"I was praying my plane would crash after the first 2 chapters.\"    Indeed",

But, alas, like in any Stephen King novel, one has to pay the price, and since woman adultery is the case here, poor Donna has a lot to chew on, to say the least.  Writing in a alcoholic stupor (as stated himself) clearly doesn't stop King from delivering an effective read.  Indeed, CUJO is gutso with lots of blood, excitement and canine hair.  Its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting, but when the gear is shifted, watch out.  Driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this Maine man.  Cloned perhaps in its \"Jaws\" bite, CUJO is nonetheless pure King when it comes to compelling plot.  Just like its Saint-Bernard creature, the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose.  Yes, the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is--enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award, for sure.  Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher",

After finishing the first Part (Paradise) I just could not keep on reading, and I abandoned the book for a while. After I landed in Israel I re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it. A thought occurred to me that the reading was so descriptive of the immigration sentiment that I just could not understand it before immigrating myself.    The book helped me to understand and to organize the infinite sensations that come with the leaving/arriving to another country. How the language affects the way we think and act, how sadness and happiness are mingled into one strange feeling, how we cope and forget without noticing, and how we urge to succeed and prove that we can be part of the new country.    In addition, the book also brought to me new feelings and curiosities about my grandparents, whom also escaped from Poland and Russia in the late 40's. Hoffman describes so well how the old traditions and languages influenced the new live of those who left their country because of prejudice and persecution!    One passage that I am specially fond of: \"No, I'm no patriot, nor was I ever allowed to be. And yet, the country of my childhood lives within me with a primacy that is a form of love. (...) All it has given me is the world, but that is enough. It has fed me language, perceptions, sounds, the human kind. It has given me the colors and the furrows of reality, my first loves. The absoluteness of those loves can never be recaptured: no geometry of the landscape, no haze in the air, will live in us as intensely as the landscapes that we saw as the first, and to which we gave ourselves wholly, without reservations.\" It reminds me of Wordsworth when he writes about Tintern Abbey.

She incorporates the latest research findings on the workings of the dog's mind in presenting her own cases from her behavior counseling service.  Her discussion of counterconditioning covers an extremely valuable concept that is not stressed (or even utilized) enough by other behaviorists and trainers. This technique is invaluable and of nearly limitless potential in alleviating many emotional distresses and disorders in dogs.      Especially pleasing to see is that in her discussion of counterconditioning and other techniques the author diverges from the decades-old approach of addressing \"behavior problems\" (a term that should be killed off and unceremoniously buried - it's not the animal's problem any more than if your husband had a habit of talking too loudly to your liking would you tell your friends that he had a behavior problem) by focusing on simply eliminating the behavior. This mechanistic behaviorism approach may be effective in eliminating the behavior but frequently does nothing to relieve the dog's underlying emotional distress that is causing the behavior. For example, if a dog is suffering from loneliness because he is tied up alone in a backyard and barks endlessly for human attention and companionship there are plenty of ways to eliminate the barking. But there is only one correct one: alleviate the emotional pain of loneliness. McConnell understands this and focuses on this underlying emotional distress when working with the dogs to change unwanted behavior. In light of the advances in neuroscience, comparative psychology, and brain imaging, this places McConnell on the leading edge of the changes underway in how unwanted behavior in dogs should be addressed.  The primary focus in treating behavior \"problems\" is to help the dog rather than the owner. McConnell gets this. Most dog behaviorists and trainers don't.     I strongly recommend this book for all dog owners who want their dogs to get the best emotional care and support in all behavior-related matters.",

            "input": "Blix couldn't take the candy from a baby -- just too kind. . &quot;Disarming Iraq&quot; is Hans Blix's thought-provoking and historically-important memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, during which he tried to paint a clear picture -- for the UN and the world -- of his inspection team's findings, claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy.      The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored.       Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix. As it reads, he was too diplomatic, unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy. It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any &quot;smoking guns&quot; in terms of banned weapons, he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Either the regime's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN, or it was hiding something. Either way, Blix's hesitation was enough to set the stage for Colin Powell's historic February 5, 2003 presentation of evidence of WMD?s in Iraq, which was more or less the proverbial point of no return.      Apparently, what Mr. Blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about WMD?s in Iraq: Blix's commission failed to find anything not because the Iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons, moving them ahead of inspections, but because the weapons really weren?t there. Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, just as they?d claimed. The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.      So how did the war move forward under false pretenses? According to Blix, &quot;a deficit of critical thinking&quot; was to blame. He speculates that our Congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror (even though Blix himself wishes for a UN resolution against brutal dictatorships). The Bush administration had to justify war in Iraq by linking it to terror, and since there was no real link, it had to capitalize on the &quot;theoretical&quot; link of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.      This is as far as his speculation goes. Where the phrase &quot;military industrial complex&quot; would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about Bush, Cheney and nefarious links to Saudi oil -- Blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of America's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance. Giving Blix the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational.      Needless to say, Dr. David Kelly's death (the British scientist who leaked to the BBC that the British government had &quot;sexed up&quot; a document alleging Iraq's nuclear capabilities) was an &quot;unfortunate suicide&quot; -- and not the work of a shadow government. (The entire document, by the way, turned out to be a forgery.)      At least Blix observed the &quot;horse trading&quot; (&quot;intense economic and diplomatic pressures&quot;) our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the UN resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the Bush administration?s spying on UN delegations while on their diplomatic visits to New York. Blix had other objections to U.S.-led efforts, but they are all based on facts and evidence, and are in defense of IAEA (a previous inspection organization, also headed by Blix) and UNMOVIC (the UN's Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission).      Interestingly, the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page &quot;cluster&quot; document released by Blix in early March of 2003, which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months. Unfortunately for France and Germany, American and British members of UNMOVIC leaked pre-release draft copies of the document. In other words, France and Germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their British and American counterparts. Their positions, in favor of renewed inspections, were not as compelling.      While Blix?s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs, one can easily see why it was so difficult for Americans to take Mr. Blix seriously: he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect. Even so, he is gifted with an even temperament, a good sense of humor, and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity, all important qualities for diplomacy. Although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the UN and Iraq, in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match Blix?s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience",

This work includes the two chapters preceeding \"The Grand Inquisitor\" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, \"The Russian Monk,\" which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.    It is important to remember that \"The Grand Inquistor\" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.    I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].

I was utterly shocked at the bad reasoning that is passed off in this book as \"proof\" that popular trends, including Pokemon and Harry Potter, as evil.    The author first claims that the vomiting and dizziness that some people experience while watching Pokemon is \"proof\" that Pokemon is Satanic. It's called 'epilepsy', Jacobs, and there were 1.4 million people who suffer from it in 1996.     She then claims that Pokemon \"encourages\" its players to cheat using the GameShark - a cheating device for those who don't know. This indicates lack of knowledge on her part. First of all, the GameShark is not a Pokemon phenomenon; you can cheat on almost any videogame. Secondly, I rather doubt that cheating on a videogame is proof of \"bad morals\" on the part of the gamer.    Jacobs concludes her Pokemon section by citing an instance when a fourteen year old Pokemon fan assaulted someone in his high school in order to obtain a Pokemon. Since when, exactly, has the bad behavior of one teenager reflected on an entire franchise? That's like saying that ALL Christians are responsible for the dishonest practices of televangelists like the Bakkers and Robert Tilton.    The section covering Harry Potter contains similar bad logic. Jacobs cites a quote from a young fan of Harry Potter who claims that they want to \"become a witch\", thereby reasoning that the entire Harry Potter franchise must be evil because of the acts of one fan.     She also concludes that Harry Potter \"must\" be evil because it is about witchcraft. The Bible contains historical accounts of entire civilizations being eliminated and many other violent subjects, but that doesn't mean that anyone who reads the Bible is murderous. It means that the Bible happens to contain violent passages.    Jacobs is supposed to prove conclusively that Harry Potter, Pokemon, Magic cards, and other trendy fads are Satanic, but I think that her arguments are quite weak. She more proves that these fads are NOT Satanic than she does prove that they are",

I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger.

They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead.    Why?    Because, it is at least from the 1930.  it contains information which is seriously dated.  Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates.  The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter.    This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird.  Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday?  Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots).    You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers.  That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers.    The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel.  Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's \"Birds of the West Indies\", which Fleming described as his bible.  Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility).  Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using  the name James Bond in his novels.    Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's \"Caribbean Birds\".    You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of \"Birds of the West Indies\" was the only show in town.    In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book.  Consider this review with that in mind",

The book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting: Auditions, Rehearsals, Sit-Coms, Serials, Small Roles, Big Roles, Touring, Film Acting.  I think Guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations.  The book is too short to teach all details for any of these, though, so you will need other sources.

            "input": "Ivory tower crackpot theories. . No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his \"experimental school.\" Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of \"progressivism?\" I would.    Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?    Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their \"natural inquisitiveness\" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the \"plus-que-parfait\" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.    90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's \"progressivism\" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one",

Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge And It's Transmission Through Myth    GIORGIO de SANTILLANA & HERTHA von DECHEND    Hamlet's Mill is an amazing piece of macrocosmic literature that should be recognized as a true classic.     While some scholars and researchers may attempt to discredit this work as attempting to pull together unrelated mythology from distant times and cultures, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Nearly all religions are based upon two primary foundations, the first being astrotheology, the second being the use of entheogens; as above, so below.     While the stars in the sky may show differently at different locations, and the plants in a specific vicinity may be different, this does not negate the overall concept of the foundations being the same.     Santillana & Dechend have done a fantastic job at providing evidence that the knowledge of the Precession of the Equinoxes is far older than can be escaped, downplayed, or ignored.     The cultural myths, though slightly varying by time and distance have the same foundations, the same origins because they're based on the same concept...the stars and heavens...know the heavens or die... essential knowledge for planting, harvesting and storing food as well as for preparing for seasonal changes.     This is a most important book of many for understanding the ancient mysteries. Other books that will help the reader understand these concepts include John Allegro, Acharya S., Robert Hewitt Brown, Gordon Wasson, John Major Jenkins, Peter Lamborn Wilson, Jonathon Ott, Terence McKenna, G. Schiaparelli, Albert Hofmann, Richard Schultes, Christian Ratsch, Joseph Campbell, Manly P. Hall, Kersey Graves, Jordan Maxwell, Ernest Busenbark, Gerald Massey,  etc., to name a few.     One draw back to the book is that the authors skipped over the highly important microcosmic research of R. Gordon Wasson which was available at the time. A tying together of these two works (Hamlet's Mill and Soma), as Jenkins discovered (Maya Cosmogenesis 2012), can not be over looked and is a most rewarding discovery.     A solid 5 star work",

This book is great for identifying problems that may be affecting you, it defines each problem very clearly, and there is a test in the beginning to help you figure out which problem areas are at the top of the list. It even gives examples of how these problem areas affect certain situations to clarify.     The problem with this book is the advice. A lot of it is very simple, and winds up contradicting itself. Some of it is not even helpful or good advice. Take for example the idea that one should ignore insults, in the chapter about Personalizing. It states that if you don't consistently ignore someone who is insulting you, it's called 'letting it get to you'. However, it's actually called 'letting someone walk all over you' and a better book would advise you to learn to be assertive and tell the person to stop, THE FIRST TIME, and if the person doesn't stop, to leave. Also, at the end of the chapter, is a real problem as well. He writes a scenario with a mother who made homemade salad dressing and her son doesn't like it. He then makes it sound as though it is okay for you to sit there and silently demean your own son in your head because of his personal tastes, saying stuff to yourself like he has an inability to appreciate good food, and that he is not the ultimate world judge of salad dressing worthiness (whilst true, this would imply the mother would think  that SHE is the ultimate world judge and is being quietly condescending), and that if she serves him bottled salad dressing next time and he complains, she can explain the error (in this case his personal tastes are considered WRONG) of his ways. This right here is an extremely poor model of appropriate thought behavior! Obviously the mother in the example is a bit of a narcissist and harmfully not allowing her son to have his own personal tastes without criticism. Things like this are why I refuse to give this book any review that makes it sound great.      So definitely take this book with a heaping pile of salt. Please don't let it be your self-help bible.

This book written by Charles Dickens is probably one of his better known works.  It has always been thought that the book is autobiographical, but it tells a really good story too, as all of Dickens' works do.  I love Dickens novels for the characters and this one does not disappoint.  We have David Copperfield himself who is the orphaned hero-narrator, and his mother Clara Copperfield and his cruel step father Edward Mardstone.  We've also got friends of David's - Clara, Daniel, Ham and Little Em'ly Peggotty, plus a whole bunch of other wonderful characters.  It's a coming of age novel for a boy of the nineteenth century, and Dickens covers all the pain and joy that goes along with growing up poor in England at this time.  We see David grow up and get married.  We see his pain as he watches his invalid wife sicken and die and his ultimate success as a writer.   Don't miss Charles Dickens' great works in your reading adventures.  I've read every one",

It is not intended as a defense of the visions, per se, but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies, and report of Marian messages to the Parish at Medjugorge, and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events. The interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying. The questions were leading and shallow, nothing like the kind of questions I wish I could ask. Even worse, the answers were stereotyped, vague, and even evasive. Was this a language barrier problem? An artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited? An effort to avoid arguments? Perhaps. But I kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with Jesus. Jesus, despite all language barriers and editing, was always very direct, clear, and substantive, and never shied away from stirring up controversy. Jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come. I remain on guard",

            "input": "Benedict's Three Points . Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is an anthropological study of Japanese culture during World War II.  It was her job to \"spell out what the Japanese were like.\" (3)  One of the great aspects of this book is that Benedict's main arguments hold true even to this day.  Although many of her examples may be a bit outdated from our modern perspective, her conclusions drawn from those examples are still valid.  However, due to the time that it was written, 1944-6, Benedict was unable to study in Japan.  Instead, she had to rely on articles already written about Japan and interviews with Japanese immigrants.  In doing so, Benedict is able to draw three major conclusions about the Japanese: Japanese society is hierarchically structured, but in such a way that allows class mobility; that everyone has a debt, or &#24681; (on), they must repay to the world; their particularistic society allows them to easily adapt to almost any situation.  For example, Benedict tells us that hierarchy is one of the key aspects of Japanese society, so much so that they have \"what is called a `respect language.'\" (47)  This means that forms of speech are altered to reflect the status of the speaker compared to the listener.  Before the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor was at the top of the hierarchy, followed by the Shogun, daimyo, samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants and finally the outcasts.  Japan operated in this hierarchical order for hundreds of years and it worked very well.  As a result of this, the Japanese people learned that as long as they did not do anything outside this order \"they could trust their world.\" (70)  It was a system which \"guaranteed security so long as one followed the rules.\" (73)  Although the Meiji Reform attempted, in part, to do away with these class distinctions, it was not terribly successful: Samurai became powerful bureaucrats, merchants still became more and more wealthy, farmers were farmers, and the outcasts were still looked down upon - despite their emancipation.  The same can be said even of today's Japan.  The elite families such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui are still very powerful.  Due to their integral role in Japan's economy, they are able to sway Diet members' opinions their way.  Another unique aspect of Japanese hierarchy, Benedict tells us, is that it allows for class mobility.  Just because one is born a merchant's son does not mean one has to always be a commoner.  As merchants during the pre-Meiji era became wealthier, they were able to marry into samurai families.  In this way, the \"merchant's descendants become samurai\" and the samurai family marries into more money. (72)  Although this still occurs today between wealthy and prestigious families, there is also another way to move up and gain social prestige.  By studying hard and getting into the best schools, one can be sure of a secure future.  If one graduates from Tokyo University, it would be very difficult to not find a good job.  In this manner, even a lowly farmer's second son can be an important man.  One point that should be made clear about the Japanese hierarchy is that the American view of hierarchy is not quite correct.  Americans views it as a very rigid and controlling way of life - indeed it is.  However, the authority that a father exerts on his family or a Shogun over the nation is not dictatorial.  The opinions and well-being of the entire group are taken into consideration before any decisions are made.  \"The master of the house saddles himself with great difficulty\" if he acts purely according to his own will. (55)  Benedict's second main observance of the Japanese is their sense of &#24681;, or indebtedness, and the need to repay it.  The Japanese believe, she tells us, that when a child is born, he is immediately indebted to the Emperor and will never be able to repay even a one-ten-thousandth of it back.  The child is also indebted to his parents.  Only after becoming one \"does he know how indebted he is to his own parents.\" (102)  Tied directly to this idea is virtue.  In Japan, repaying ones debts is a very important part of life.  One must always be careful to remember &#24681; to the Emperor and the parents.  Therefore, it is considered a virtue when one works toward repaying any debts and as a burden to acquire more.  This sense of repaying someone continues even now.  It is evident in gift giving practices in which an employee gives a boss a New Year's present as a way of paying him back for employment.  Also, when a guest visits a family he will often bring &#12362;&#37202; (sake) or some other small present as repayment for burdening the family.  A peculiar side-effect of &#24681; is that people do not often help strangers in need.  To do so would be to give that person &#24681; they would likely not be able to repay.  Benedict's final insight into the Japanese culture is their ability to adapt to almost any situation.  The most obvious example of this is their attitude toward the Occupation.  When the Emperor announced the unconditional surrender of Japan, the Japanese considered it a natural course of events and \"accepted all that such a fact implied.\" (305)  There are numerous stories of the politeness showed to American troops upon arrival in Japan.  Even the fact that there were no resistance forces or sabotage attempts during the Occupation is a strong testament to this ability.  \"Japan's real strength,\" Benedict says, \"lies in her ability to say..., `That failed,'\" and take a completely different path. (304)  Benedict then says Japan \"could make herself indispensable in the commerce of the East,\" which could not be closer to the truth. (314)  Japan's economy boomed after the Reconstruction and made it the technological center of the world.  Of course, anyone could make such a prediction given the fact that Japan was no longer allowed to have an army.  All the money that had been poured into the military could now be directed elsewhere.  Overall, I believe The Chrysanthemum and the Sword accomplishes Benedict's goal of describing the fundamentals of Japanese culture and is a great addition to the existing literature on Japan.  As I have previously stated, some of her examples are indeed old-fashioned (i.e. the stern mother-in-law and the tale of Hachiko) and may appear irrelevant to the study of modern Japan; however, what she is able to draw from these examples is still applicable.  We should consider that even though America today is much different than the America of the `40's, the same sorts of principles are held today - this can also be said of modern Japan",

Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' It is disingenuous for Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus. He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the \"patronizing nonsense\" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, \"...a religionless Christianity must be born.\" Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been absent and not around to defend himself.    I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was also interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.    I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.    Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Spong) to take the very (true) words I have just said in this paragraph and make it sound convincingly like, \"You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...blah blah blah.\"    I offer one piece of advice. However, I admit I base this advice on my belief that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.",

Well....I read it and what a waste of time.  Stilted, unnatural dialogue and narration, a spoon-fed simplistic plot, robotic and one-dimensional characters, and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst I have read in many years.  The sentences \"He stared into her eyes\" and \"He placed his hand on her shoulder\" appeared four times in the space of six pages; then for good measure, the author throws them in several more times later in the book.  There is no context given; what do they imply--a threat, a romantic interest?  The writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up  and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader couldn't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next.  In my case, perhaps that was true because  the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting.  I forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when I began.  Did the author self publish this book?  Please, sir, go to writing school and get an editor",

Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of \"people, profits, and planet\" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well.     It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking?    At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet.    There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money.     There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business.     Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that.    Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new",

            "input": "\"Streamers\": a powerful glimpse at military life . \"The Vietnam Plays, Volume Two,\" by David Rabe, contains two plays: \"Streamers\" and \"The Orphan,\" together with a 1992 afterword by the author.  The book includes production information on both plays.  \"Streamers\" was produced and staged in 1976, and \"The Orphan\" was first produced professionally in 1973.    \"Streamers\" looks at a group of Army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to Vietnam while the war is going on.  Rabe focuses on a group of three roommates, all junior soldiers.  As these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play, Rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference: race, sexual orientation, educational background, rank.  Early on in the play Rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds.  Also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans.    \"Streamers\" is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life, but I found it to be a dense and complex text, rich in irony, that rewards careful reading.  It's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension, lust, anxiety, anger, and violence.  Particularly piercing is Rabe's look at the intersection of verbal \"violence\" and physical violence.    I found \"The Orphan\" far less interesting than its companion piece.  In it Rabe melds ancient Greek lore with late-20th century American concerns.  Although the play has some strong moments, overall I felt it lacked effectiveness.  I felt that Rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the Trojan and Vietnam wars to shed light on each other.  Nevertheless, the presence of \"Streamers\" in this volume makes the book well worth owning, especially for those with an interest in the literature of war.  Recommended companion text for \"Streamers\": \"A Sense of Honor,\" a novel by James Webb",

            "input": "Excellent catuionary tale; funny and lively . Not too many children's authors could get away with a story in which a bad little boy is eaten up by a lion, but Sendak handles this potentially unsettling story line with a master's touch.     Children will love the repetition of \"I don't care,\" which seems to be Pierre's response to everything, and the varied rhyme scheme keeps the text from becoming a monotonous set of couplets.     After his exasperated parents leave him home alone (the picture of them walking away from Pierre's perspective might actually be more of a threat to the listener than being eaten), a lion shows up at his house. The foolhardy Pierre is not impressed in the slightest, and won't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten. After Pierre's parents return home, they figure out what happened, assault the lion, and take him to the hospital, where a chastened Pierre is extracted uninjured.     Sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there. Like Shel Silverstein and Roald Dahl, there is a hint of wickedness to his work, but it's all in good fun.     This is a classic, pure and simple; a complete Sendak collection is a good idea for any child!",

But that's just the style. The way the story was presented was what I had a problem with.    It seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like, and he didn't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book, so he just presented it as fiction, but didn't quite know how to do that.     Characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth. Then, they drop off. All of a sudden, near the end, they come back, and now they're like generals or something, or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of Armaggedon. WHAT?!     This book is a grid, a blueprint for a certain way it COULD happen. It is not a story about people, or a story with a plot. It is just a list of events that read on until Jesus comes.     The only reason I gave it two stars was because it didn't follow the whole rapture-theory at all(that word isn't in the Bible, and even implications of one doesn't say WHEN during the tribulation it would be). In this story, the Christians are here for the whole thing, and everything isn't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the Left Behind series. It follows the premise that throughout the last century or so, we've already experienced the Seal Judgements, and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face.    IF you want a different take and aren't expecting much of anything else, read this, but not if you want a real story with passion or voice.",

In a letter to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers Solzhenitsyn writes, \"Lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society, that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a façade.\" Cancer Ward is no façade.    A truly moving story of life and death, disease and recovery, Cancer Ward is a novel with impact. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story. From loyal party member Pavel Nikolayevich to labor camp survivor Oleg Kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between, the virtues and faults of socialism are examined, dissected, and layed out clearly for the reader.    While his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels, novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of Stalinism, Solzhenitsyn took a grave risk. He wrote novels which reflected truth. He wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people. And, in the end, he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved.    Make no mistake. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was no rebel. He truly loved his country and supported his government. His use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country. It was Solzhenitsyn's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems. Alas, his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the Soviet government.    Fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost. They found their way out of Russia and onto the stage of World Literature. For this we can all be thankful. Cancer Ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone's library.

            "input": "A Giant among Giants . Some books are optional.  \"The Worm Ouroboros\", by E. R. Eddison, is not.  It is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it.  It is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply don't do.  When you read \"The Worm Ouroboros\" you'll realize that modern writers produce stories, but they don't tell Stories.    Since the English language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review, I'll just have to present samples of Eddison's writing:    \"But a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with a screaming mouth, so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake: there a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye: leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the bulk of a big man's body, velvet-dark sapphires, crystolite, beryl, amethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold.\" (7)    Everyone can write description, but only Eddison could write description like this.  He makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the \"monsters\" stick out in your mind.  And even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like, you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph.  Eddison realized that you can't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times.    \"Now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days' space in the Zia valley, above the gorges.  Here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side.  High in the south , couched above great gray moraines, the Zia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos, thrusts his snout into the valley.  Here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather.  The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight.\" (153)    Perhaps it's because I'm a mountain-climber myself, but I found Juss and Brandoch Daha's assault on Koshtra Pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters.  In real life no two mountain ranges are alike, yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains.  Eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers, feel the biting cold winds, and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes, he needs to give his mountains some real personality.  These samples, of course, only scratch the surface of Eddison's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor; he maintains this level, never flagging, for all two hundred thousand words.    But of course \"The Worm Ouroboros\" could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing.  On one side King Gorice XII of Witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will.  Opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of Demonland, lead by the magnificent Lord Juss and his family.  The ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea, across continents and mountain ranges.  And without any doubt Eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration:      \"La Fireez,\" said Juss, \"we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee.  Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until I had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage.  So sware I or ever went that ill journey to Carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered.  Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination.  But when that is done, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our love.\"  Said the Prince, \"Thou doest right.  If thou didst other thou'dst have my blame.\"  \"And mine thereto,\" said Gaslark.  \"Do not I grieve, think'st thou, to see the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more wan o' the cheek and pale?  And all for sorrow and teen for her own true love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco.  And she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately.  I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and to-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland.\" (315)    One of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life.  \"The Worm Ouroboros\" is larger than larger than life.  Indeed, after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as \"smaller than Eddison\"",

            "input": "Another Great Indian Con being lapped up by the world... . Let me start by explaining the title of my review: being an Indian (settled in India, not outside) I am incessantly perplexed by the plethora or completely rubbish books from India which the West just can't seem to get enough of. Books which say nothing about India, and are not about it. Just books set in India, which throw in some curry and some local language, and somehow thus make people fall all over themselves in an attempt to praise the book. My gut revolts against such partisanship, and this is one of those books which is a perfect example of this rubbish trend, and hence is going to get such deserving treatment at my hands.    But let me start by going back a bit in time and giving credit where it's due: after reading his first two books, I came to the very early conclusion that Vikram Chandra was the narrator's Narrator, a storyteller of uncommon brilliance, a weaver of magic tales. On the flip side, like most other Chandra fans, I too was frustrated by his ability to end every one of his stories in the worst all of all possible ways; but I loved his craft nonetheless. I had almost convinced myself that with his next book, I'd stop about 10% before the end of the book, and with Sacred Games, that promise turned out to be very easy to fulfill - I managed to put the book down without dying of guilt about halfway through itself.    Sacred Games is a book about nothing: there are no characters who feel real, it is not about the protagonists' environment, it doesn't rotate around or shed new light on any events, and it doesn't deal with any objects of fascination. Nothing. Nil. Zilch. Nada. A lot of people have talked about this as another of the, if not the definitive Bombay book, but having lived there myself, I can vouch for the fact that this book doesn't even begin to capture an iota of the character or the essence of Bombay. (If you really want to read about the city, read \"Shantaram\" - now that's a book!) In fact, I think one of the lowest points of the book is how it fails to create any context - the events of this book could almost have happened anywhere, at almost any point in time. (And no, that does not make it timeless - just outright insipid.) Simple mechanisms like linkages to some real-life events would have given the reader something to hold on to - but no, Mr. Chandra refuses to give any straws to the drowning. Reviewers have gone ga-ga over it's portrayal of the Bombay Mafia, but there is nothing said here which is even remotely new, and there isn't the slightest different twist to it. Dons, corrupt policemen, actors, dancing girls, slums, and smuggling - everything has been told, and told much better.     A stunningly stupid highlight of this book is the copious usage of local language without any glossary to help the readers understand what the terms mean. I have almost been a local there, and though I understood most of the local or slang language, there were terms which bewildered even me. I understand that Mr. Chandra believes that this deliberate omission of explanations draws you into the story, but when there are 10 or more such words per page, it will leave a lot of readers more irritated than intrigued.    Overall, I would strongly recommend avoiding this book. The Indians because there is nothing here that you don't know or can't read about in a better written book, and the rest because this is not about India -it's just a forced nowhere story. Save your money and your time. Go buy or read something else.",

A superb cold-war design; it was meant to be a sort of man-guided supersonic cruise missile for delivery of nuclear weapons to tactical targets in the european theater. It was, of course, never used for this purpose, but was instead put to a use in the air war over Vietnam. The Thud was never meant to be a precision dive bomber, or to pass through heavily defended areas at subsonic speeds. All the same, politicians dictated this use (and of course went looking for someone besides themselves to blame when their \"top fighter-bomber\" started getting shot down in heroic quantity; so many were shot down, there weren't enough seasoned men to continue to fly them. They were shot down in so many myriads, fresh out of pilot school fighter-bomber jocks, or long grounded middle-aged desk jockies would be put directly into combat (where they would often be shot down).    The men who flew this jet were, as the cliche goes, a special breed of heroes. Unlike, say, fighter pilots or B-52 pilots, they faced almost certain death, or horrible imprisonment. Their survival rate was comparable to that of the B-17 tailgunner over Germany in WW-2; very low indeed. Oftentimes their missions were secret in nature, so the government couldn't even acknowledge that the Thud had been shot down and work for the release of the pilot.    Major Rasimus' memoire takes place at a crucial escalation in the war; in 1966. The Johnson administration decided to escalate the war by \"sending messages\" to the North Vietnamese via the use of bombing as a psychological and diplomatic tool. The hare-brained scheme was that, by bombing one thing, and not another, the NVA would be trained, like a pet dog is trained with a rolled up newspaper. The idea was ridiculous, and of course didn't work.     Rasimus was one of those unsung heroes who, fresh out of pilot school, grew enormous handlebar moustaches to protect them from evil on their impossible missions. He tells the tales of the base dog, Roscoe, and of various of his team, and those who came after. You can practically smell the oil on the tarmac, and the blackpowder charges which combat-started the '105's engines. While americans would rather forget the war in Vietnam, I can't forget the courage of these men who fought in these insane supersonic contraptions. May their spirit inspire a new generation of warriors. Thanks Ed; for your service and your great book",

I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.

Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.

He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white.    In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle.    This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan.  The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom.    As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons.    1.  When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize.  In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who \"speak in tongues.\"  And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be.    2.  The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs.  We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot.    3.  Implausibility.  There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess.    4.  My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers.  In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of \"like\"s and \"way lame\"s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake.  I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous.    If you want to try Deaver, check out The Devil's Teardrop or the Bone Collector.  This is not worth the effort",

            "input": "An Excellent Overview . This work grabs you immediately with its description of the \"standstill\" procedure.  A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter.  Fascinating stuff.      The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery.  The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc.  There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible.  But something was missing.    In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch.  This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases .  Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines.  Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better.  Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus.  Nevertheless, highly recommended",

            "input": "Useful Drawings but Worthless 'Analysis' . Over the years (decades actually), Peter Eisenman's \"Terragni\" took on something of the urban myth, an elusive, unpublished work, supposedly of great genius.  Draft copies were jealously hoarded by a few insiders adding to the myth.  Now, after 40 years, it appears in print, no longer only the stuff of legend, but an actuality exposed to real scrutiny.  Frankly, the wait has not been worth it.  Exhaustively drafted from every conceivable projection and angle, the images of the building are accompanied by a text (a `critical text', the author repeatedly informs us), that pushes the limits only of the ridiculous.  For example: the plan of the Casa del Fascio, Eisenman \"discovers\", is a square, or rather, almost a square.  In order to satisfy Eisenman's supposition, the true square, it seems, is realized only when particular window is opened fully to the 90 degree position, thereby implying a volumetric extension of the building, which then completes the so-called purity of the geometry.  The fact that other windows on other sides of the building might also be opened at the same time thereby undermining the purported geometrical purity, does not seemed to have occurred to the author so blinded is he by the supposed brilliance of this, the most pretentious of studies. Numerous equally untenable speculations flesh out the remainder of this overwrought, but ultimately fruitless examination.  Terragni's classical parti is studiously avoided by the author who is largely ignorant of the precepts that underlie this, the most basic formal arrangement that Terragni carried through his design.  Eisenman stretches similar guesswork beyond the point of irritation as though insulting the intelligence of his readers is one of the underlying purposes of this book.  In the architectural industry, asinine speculation, masquerading as theory or as philosophical inquiry, are now the norm. This particular book has been billed as Peter Eisenman's \"eagerly awaited magnum opus\".   Certainly the Casa del Fascio is deserving of study.  However, if perchance \"Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critiques\" does achieve long-lasting fame, it can only be for becoming the late 20th Century's high water mark of architectural pretentiousness and unbounded historical ignorance.

'The Glorious Cause' is the second in Shaara's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the Revolutionary War. 'Rise to Rebellion' was the first, and I believe the superior of the two, but 'The Glorious Cause' is an excellent novel as well.    'Rise to Rebellion' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in John Adams and Benjamin Franklin concerning the issue of independence from England. 'The Glorious Cause' has little of that type deep soul-searching. However, it is a fantastic portrayal of the difficulties encountered by the Continental Army and George Washington, in particular.    If I were to have my druthers, I would have preferred that Shaara had broken this 600+ page novel into two novels and expanded them both by delving more into the politics of the day and the difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the Contintenal Congress was hampered with.     In addition, more battles and fronts could have been explored, such as the ill-fated American invasion of Canada and Benedict Arnold's naval adventures on Lake Champlain.    That being said, these are still a highly recommended novels - either for the American Revolution novice or the enthusiast.     Well done, Mr. Shaara",

De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face.  The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc.  He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them.  My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone.

London is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes.  His writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. This isn't a story to read when you are depressed. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors. The story he tells is stark and real, and as such, it is not pretty picture he paints, nor an elevating story he writes.     As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes. Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches.     Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with,  he thrives. Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to \"the call of the wild,\" becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed",

McCoy, and the others listed in the 'Preface'. It takes place in Washington DC. Ronald Malcolm works for the \"American Literary Historical Society\", and reads detective and mystery novels to summarize its plots for his employer. One day their new accountant tells Malcolm there is a discrepancy in the records; of seven crates shipped from Seattle only five crates arrived in Washington. This had not been noticed previously. The accountant reports this loss in a memo.    Malcolm reports to work on Thursday. It is his turn to go out for sandwiches for lunch, and he uses a basement exit for a short-cut. He also runs an errand. He returns to find the front door locked; he has to use his key. Then he finds that all of his co-workers have been killed by professional assassins. Malcolm leaves the building and calls the \"panic number\" from a public phone to report the maximum damage; he is told to disappear and call back later. When Malcolm calls back, he is told to make contact in an alley of a Georgetown theater. But his rescue team takes a shot at Malcolm, who fires back, escapes, and goes to ground. Will Malcolm be rescued by he CIA or found by the killers? And who is the double agent?    After you read this novel you can better understand the film, which is a simplified and condensed version (called \"Three Days ...). The story was changed from drug smuggling (to censor drug references?), and relocated to NY city. This story seems implausible to me, since eliminating the one link in Seattle would avoid the furious investigation that would follow a massacre of seven in Washington DC.",

My favorite piece in this book is 'Answers to a Questionnaire'--  vintage Sontag-- thinking, witnessing, and finally enlightening everything she must.  Despite the self-loathing revealed by a number of American reviewers below who show themselves apparently ready to detest integrity itself, the naked truth comes clear and comes clear!  Clear thinking may yet be the last frontier!  A worthy argument for such is surely made in the pages of this book.  It is even for those who are spiteful without cause to discover themselves lurking in the heart of this book, grevious as ignorance is, & wretched as spite becomes in the end.  Listen-- vitriolic political sideswiping is as American as dumplings.  Sontag, characteristically and sympathetically, not only notes its irrevelance, but conjures an antidote called moral patience, so no wonder all the shouts and curses against her!  Making certain their own avenues of self-discovery venture nothing wiser than a hepped up, but sunless, hyper-nationalism wretchedly disguised as patriotism, it's unfortunately not surprising the chorus of disappoval this woman engenders.  Thank goodness Sontag remains preoccupied with her Art!--  a living, teaching, redemptive art burnished, by now, to an holistic glow, as every page of this book bears witness.

Still, he was one of the prime lenders to the modern comic language, so I suppose this is some publisher's way of patting him on the head and saying thanks for the memories.    Don't expect to come away with any newer material already covered in \"How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\" by Stan Lee and Buscema (very simplistic book but the comic dynamics are much better) or any new sensitivity to modern storytelling.

I usually start by describing some of the plot, but the story-lines are only about a third of this book's considerable charm. So . . .     The Setting: This is an alternate history tale, as far as the setting goes. It takes place on Earth, and more preciously in (what is left of) England. But, this Earth had no Ice Age, it was struck by an object (popularly believed to have been a meteor) that caused the Sundering (the seas rose, the land was mostly submerged, cultures lost touch with one another, the climate changed drastically), and humans live side-by-side with mastodons, mammoths, glyptodonts, and other creatures that did not perish (because there was no Ice Age). The result is an isolated England, that retains much of its past, but has culturally evolved away from what it is (to us).     The Characters: I am not sure that I have ever read another book that is populated by this many quirky, interesting, amusing, well-developed characters. These are very realistic people, living in a surreal time. Even their names are colorful, quirky, and interesting: Dr. Pinches, Mrs. Matchless, Mr. Threadneedle, Tim Christmas. The characters and the writing speak strongly of a Dickensian influence, but is definitely also just plain Jeffrey Barlough's.     The Plots: Yes, I did say \"Plots\" in the plural. There are three, distinct story-lines, that share some characters and the same setting and time period.     The woes of Ms. Jane Wastefield is what I would entitle one story-line, wherein a beautiful young woman receives a birthday present that terrifies her father to death and then haunts her every waking moment. How can she be rid of the fiendish thing?! Who can help her? Everyone wants to, but no one seems to know how. Will she succumb? Would defeat be as terrible as she fears? And what about her pet monkey?     The wizarding notions would be a good title for the story-line about Mr. Threadneedle, his apprentice Tim Christmas, and whatever they are tinkering with out in the coach-house. Can they make it work? Will everyone be shocked? Will anyone believe them, without seeing the finished product? Will Mr. Threadneedle find some peace and enjoyment, if he succeeds?     The secret of the will is what bothers another set of characters. When rich old Joseph Cargo died, he left most of his estate to his favorite nephew, but who is Jerry Squailes, and why does he get one-fourth of the money? No one knows, and young Frederick Cargo, spurred on by his shrewish wife and aided by their elderly, honest attorney, Mr. Liffey, go on a mission to uncover the truth. Will they like the truth, when and if they find it? Will that thing kill any of them before they do solve the mystery of Jerry Squailes, the unknown heir?     My Take: This book is some of the best escapist reading I have ever found. The world described is so different (but not) and so replete with interesting characters, that it becomes a great place to retreat to. The writing is very detailed, with tremendous development of setting, characters, and the interweaving stories. It is truly a fascinating journey to take, and the ending(s) is not how Hollywood or fairy tales would do it, with a panoply of happily-ever-after. However, it is also not depressing. This tale is just plain well done.    The Bottom Line  This is a very memorable experience that takes you to a different place and tells you an interesting tale about amusing characters.

Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old \"The sky is falling\", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in \"the last times.\" He \"knows\" this because he sees so many antichrists around.   1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the \"last times.  1 Peter 4:7 \"The end of all things is at hand.\"  James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.       Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called \"End Time Signs\" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the \"mark of the beast\" started in 1948.

He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, \"Where is the promise of his coming?\" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that \"one day with the Lord is as a thousand years.\"    Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.    Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, \"Behold, I come quickly.    Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!",

Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him.

The earth is surrounded by a sinister presence - a dark, foul fog that is the tool of an ultimate evil - whose ambition is to enslave the planet with the complete removal of free will. Three magical beings, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which - witches, angels, demigods perhaps - appear to Margaret and Charles Wallace Murry and their friend, Calvin O'Keefe, to persuade them that it is their destiny to battle this evil on its own turf and to rescue Margaret and Charles Wallace's father. Dr Murry has been missing for some months and the kids learn that he has been captured by the evil while he was \"tessering\", traveling time and space in the course of his scientific research.    While the writing is straightforward, well crafted and obviously aimed at a younger audience, \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is nonetheless a fast paced enjoyable tale of good vs evil that combines elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic even adult readers will flip through relentlessly. But there are lots of life lessons, issues and moral themes sprinkled throughout - low hanging fruit just waiting for the eager child, the observant questioning teen, the confused parent or thinking adult to pick and chew on, as it were - the coming of age realization that parents are not infallible; the cruelty of malicious gossip; God and evil; the awkwardness of romantic adolescent relationships; the potential destructiveness of pride or vanity; the marginalizing of people who are different; the enormous difficulties of selflessness; the understanding that all life's questions will not be answered; and more.    While some readers criticize \"A Wrinkle in Time\" as being overtly moralist, I felt somewhat differently. It was clear to me that religion and, in particular, Christian symbolism was present but I felt that L'Engle let it sit quietly just beneath the surface and the story never became even remotely preachy.    It is little wonder that \"A Wrinkle in Time\" has been elevated to the status of children's classic and continues to be enjoyed by adults and children alike more than 40 years after it was first published for a grateful reading world.

They are already people pleasers and perfectionists, how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help? They are already as good as they can get themselves to be.

God loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain. These are very good people.

The author fancies himself a Copernicus, by, similarly to the reversal of the notion that the sun revolves around the earth, rendering the notion of consciousness an \"illusion\" (last word, p.178). His ego is indeed enormous, my knowing of no other author quoting (p.45) and incessantly citing his own writing.    The notion of the sun revolving is an inference, from observing its change of position relative to the earth, and motion indeed is considered relative. But consciousness is not an inference. It is the most immediate phenomenon by which everything we know, or imagine, is manifested. Dennett persistently investigates distinctions in our brains, from dispositions to memories, often couching them in esoteric or otherwise unfamiliar terms, while sidestepping the simple fact that whatever the detailed particulars, all is presented to us through the medium of consciousness.    He puts great emphasis on the third-person approach, like questioning a subject about his perceptions, so as to discover misunderstandings about the inner workings of the mind, forgetting that all of these, whether actual perceptions or beliefs or else, are ingredients of consciousness. This his \"scientific method\", compared to first-person introspection, is the only approved one.    It is shared by others. Like Patricia Churchland, he has contempt for \"folk\" psychology, pitting it against favored \"academic\" (p.35). They also share a derogatory attitude toward dissenters, regarding them as reactionaries (p.8) or naysayers. The views are admittedly materialist, holding Cartesian dualism of mind and body \"bankrupt\" or a \"disaster\", as does John Searle.    Why? Descartes is not in line with their assumed all-inclusive scientific method, embraced also by philosophers, who traditionally delved deeper into issues of knowledge. I do so newly in my book and here wish to note that however physical inquiry progresses, consciousness, via which the inquiry is made, remains a distinct phenomenon.",

            "input": "Inconsistent - some greatness amongst some disjointed tedium . I got this for Christmas and finished it late last night.     As the tale begins, the author initiates two primary storylines, The first is set in WWII spanning both the European and Pacific theatres. The second is modern day and is centered on a California start-up (with requisite ambitious young guys) with primary business interests in the far east. One knows the stories are connected because of similar last names in both. The other connection is encryption - how crytography was central to the war and how it is central to current day business and, in the author's view, central to the future of civilization.    One of the great pluses of the book is how the author made use of these commonalities between WW2 and modern-day to create interest and anticipation. The middle of the book actually made use of these quite well and I was eager to keep reading. There is some terrific writing in middle sections and descriptions of people and places both in Europe and the Far East are very vivid.    The author does write with terrific humour at times and I was reminded in several places about a series of books written about WWI called \"The Bandy Papers - the Journals of Bartholomew Bandy\" by Donald Jack. Very similar in style as the author captures the points of view - dry wit - of Grandpa (WW2) and grandson (techno geek) Waterhouse.    The presentation of Gen. Douglas McArthur was (from my Canadian perpective) endearingly flag-waving-pipe-chomping-bullet- shedding-American-Super-hero and, of course, totally unbelievable.    Then I hit the final pages where I had hoped to receive a big-payoff to the build-up over the previous thousand pages. Alas, it was not to be and all the tedious verbiage that scarred the entire book turned out to be a sad bell-weather.    One of the \"1 star\" reviews amongst these reviews suggested that Tolkien was nothing compared to Neal Stephenson as far as filling up pages with words. There are numerous examples of page after page of \"who cares\" blathering which may tell us that some of the characters are in fact terribly boring individuals but do not deepen the characterizations. One of the good points is that when you hit such a section - and the reader will recognize them - you can simply skip about 5 pages or more and pick up the story without missing anything. The book could have been shortened by about 400 pages, maybe more. I'm guessing there is an encrypted message in the pages somewhere but I couldn't care less.    Some story lines, characters and inferences are left totally unresolved in the end (e.g. what happened to the dentist?). A case of author boredom and a loss of interest as the ending approached? And why the heck did Andrew Loeb make a final appearance! Talk about out-of-place and just bizarre.    I dunno what the author is thinking sometimes but several times he comes across as just a tad too clever. At least 3 times during the book (inluding the opening pages) I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. For example, one such bit of cleverness is his incorporation of the Hindenberg disaster in New Jersey - the narrative is written at that point from the perspective of a main character who stumbles literally out of the woods after seeing a brightness in the sky. It is not central or even obliquely of interest to the story line. The author never mentions Hindenberg by name and it is left to the reader (if you can pass the author's ever-so-clever test of cleverness) to figure it out. It seemed somewhat a condescending (to the reader) writing style.    There is the usual technology-dropping (like dropping names but gadgets instead of people) to presumably up the coolness factor and from my knowledge it is mostly, but not always, believable.    Ultimately, why there is some terrific writing, the overall result is a draft that needs 1 or 2 more rewrites and a worthy ending to really tell a terrific story.      Summary - go directly to Tom Clancy's books which are executed much better and have endings that offer a consistent pay-off (but with less humour). Clancy can also go on and on... but not like this guy!    The paperback story is 1130 pages of small type that is hard to read",

Most egregiously in error is the author's characterization of Catholic social teaching. He wuld have us believe that the Catholic Church is all behind the US social welfare system. Just one quote summarizes where the Catholic Church really is on this issue:     \"In recent years the range of such intervention has vastly expanded, to the point of creating a new type of state, the so-called \"Welfare State.\" This has happened in some countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands, by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human person. However, excesses and abuses, especially in recent years, have provoked very harsh criticisms of the Welfare State, dubbed the \"Social Assistance State.\" Malfunctions and defects in the Social Assistance State are the result of an inadequate understanding of the tasks proper to the State. Here again the principle of subsidiarity must be respected: a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a view to the common good. By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility, the Social Assistance State leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies, which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern for serving their clients, and which are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending. In fact, it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people who are closest to them and who act as neighbors to those in need. It should be added that certain kinds of demands often call for a response which is not simply material but which is capable of perceiving the deeper human need. One thinks of the condition of refugees, immigrants, the elderly, the sick, and all those in circumstances which call for assistance, such as drug abusers: all these people can be helped effectively only by those who offer them genuine fraternal support, in addition to the necessary care.\" (Pope John Paul II, Centessimus Annus, 1991)       I could give you a quote for every other case where the author misrepresents Church teaching. The author assumes that poor people are poor because others have too much. This assumption is NOT shared by the Catholic Church. I am a conservative largely because of Catholic social teaching.",

This book achieved instant fame when it was published in 1919, not only for its scathing criticism of the Versailles Treaty but also for its personal attacks against leading signatories (especially Clemenceau and Wilson).  For a book focused primarily on economic concerns, the text is surprisingly easy to read.  However, the book's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness.  The principle reason the book is still famous today lies in the fact that it was written by none other than John Maynard Keynes, the founder of 20th century style, gov't & debt driven economics.    The book is organized into chapters on pre-war Europe, Allied statesmen, summary of key treaty points, reparations, post-war Europe predictions, and Keynes' suggestion of remedies to provide a practical treaty settlement.  Unfortunately, within each chapter things are jumbled together without clear rhyme or reason.  (Is this indicative of Keynes' own personal organization and logical thinking?)      Within the book, he makes a very practical (but politically infeasible) argument for a non-vindictive treaty.  He basically suggests that the Allies should forget both about reparations and repayment of wartime debts from the other Allies, and instead they should settle (though not ideally) for frontier adjustments and confiscation of only German gov't property.  (Did the German gov't sponsor Keynes' work in writing this book?)    Keynes argues that a crushing reparations burden on the German people would disincent them to produce anything beyond a mere subsistence minimum and discourage entrepreneurial enterprise.  There is some logic in this point; however, later on he goes on to state that the US should forgive its $10 billion debt to its wartime allies ($5 billion of which was owed by the UK).  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but doesn't such a move disincent American entreprises from entrepreneurship as well.  It's extremely hypocritical that the Allied gov'ts desperately sought loans from the US during the war and then once it was over to claim that they couldn't pay them.  If they didn't want to repay, then they shouldn't have borrowed the money - period.  (If I borrow money to buy a home, the bank won't ever agree to forgive my debt - regardless of whether I'm out of work, injured, or the house burns down.  I don't see why gov'ts should get any exceptional treatment.)    Notwithstanding his problems with disorganization and inconsistent logic, Keynes does produce a reasonable, brief list of treaty rememdies, especially in his efforts to restore economic life throughout Central and Eastern Europe.  Not until the advent of the Cold War and the interests of extending American political influence would Keynes' policies largely succeed (albeit yet again to the detriment of American taxpayers).    Overall, I felt the book was ok.  I would only recommend it if you have an interest in reading all of Keynes' work.  Don't expect to find any theoretical economic insights in the book, though.  Based on the high ratings on this page, I think the other reviewers here might have some pro-Keynesian bias",

This book, published originally in three installments, is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction, like DARK KNIGHT and WATCHMEN, but I just don't see it. Generally speaking, I like Gaiman's story lines, but this time it's all just confusing. The title character, a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob, is killed in the first few pages -- but there's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost. Or something. A newly hatched flower-woman, who seems to share some of the dead one's memories, sets out to uncover her identity. I think. The mob is run by Lex Luthor (why?), who wants to capture her and/or her little sister (or whatever) for dissection. But Carl, just out of prison, who used to work for Luthor and who previously murdered his wife, upon whom the orchids were based, can't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone. This guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly, in the last installment, the action having relocated to the Amazon Basin, he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer. (How?) Other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot, including one who became the Swamp Thing, but none of what they say or do makes much sense. And why does Batman get a cameo? (Not to mentioned assorted bad guys from Gotham?)

As the concept of the modular structure of the brain emerged, objections to the idea took the form of \"Well, if my brain's made up of computers, somebody in there has to be in charge.  It had better be me!\"   This comment, paraphrased from philosopher Jerry Fodor, typifies what Daniel Dennett has been contending with for many years.  Although the \"Cartesian theatre\" notion, that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - \"dualism\" -  has supposedly been supplanted, it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness.  We continue to insist, in some form or other, that \"somebody, and it better be me\" is inside our minds looking out at the world.  Although we can't find that \"self\" in there, we have a hunch it's there.    When Dennett wrote \"Consciousness Explained\" in 1991, it seemed the \"homunculus\" representing our \"self\" had been laid to rest.  This excellent collection of essays and lectures, is an update on that earlier work.  As lectures, they have a conversational tone, yet impart many deep insights.  Addressing consciousness through four major themes, Dennett shows us the project of eradicating \"dualism\" remains incomplete.  Until that view of \"self\" is discarded, our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading.    The first theme he addresses is the \"zombie\".  Philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person, identical to you in every way but one, is logically possible.  The person would act as you act, talk as you do, have the same preferences and distastes.  But it would not be conscious.  This proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie.  For most of us, who still feel our \"self\" remains somehow separate within us, the logic seems reasonable.  Dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal, and dismisses it as modernised dualism.  If a region of the brain holds the key to \"self\" it remains out of sight and undetectable.    Perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with \"heterophenomonology\".  This tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science.  Because consciousness is \"often celebrated as a mystery beyond science\" Dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques.  Become a \"Martian\" cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work.  One facet of this approach relies on understanding what \"folk psychology\" is, then building from there.  We prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible.  Heterophenomonolgy, he contends, will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a \"mystery\".      One of those \"mysteries\" has been wrapped in the idea of \"qualia\".  Probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy, \"qualia\" are things said to possess \"intrinsic qualities\".  When you carefully examine those \"intrinsic\" properties, they begin to fade and vanish.  If \"qualia\" is in an object we see, such as colour, how can it change without our noticing?  Tests of \"change blindness\" indicate we can miss much concerning \"qualia\".  Even the philosophic community, Dennett notes, cannot agree on a definition of \"qualia\".  Yet, like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world, it steadfastly remains in use.  The author examines this idea further in relating the story of \"Mary\", the colour-deprived scientist.    In \"Consciousness Explained\", Dennett proposed the Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness and cognition.  In this collection, he enhances the original concept.  With no centre in the brain, consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process.  The progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain's functions.  Dennett argues that the brain is \"fame\" not \"television\".  The process is one of competition for dominance, no matter how fleeting.  The mind is not a \"top-down\" or \"bottom-up\" process, but a \"sideways\" one.  Ideas, experiences and other informational bits jostle for \"clout\".  It's not easy to shed the idea of a special \"self\" in your mind, but all that's going on in there is still you.     As usual, Dennett has challenged successfully the \"established\" views of consciousness.  Clearly, he argues, consciousness is neither an arcane \"mystery\" nor beyond serious and definitive investigation.  The mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of \"qualia\" and the mortar of the \"Cartesian theatre\" can, and must be, overcome for serious investigation to proceed.  Delicacy and care must be employed, but the prize is understanding.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada",

I've read the Left behind series twice, and, both times, I blazed through 'Armageddon'. In my honest opinion, it was one of the best in the series. Why? Simply due to logical progression.     When one of the main characters make a stupid and fatal mistake, we are taken on a journey with them. When another one of the 'heroes' makea stupid move in judgment, we are taken on the journey with them. When one of the longtime main characters in the series decides to step into the warzone, he is not in the middle of some act of God that will save his life.     Armageddon is simply one of the wildest books in the series and relies on very little, if any, use of deus ex machina to bail out the stupid main characters.     True, the writing is still simple and the characters even simpler, but by this point, you should alreayd know that. The thing about Armageddon that makes it so good is the pace it moves. It's both frenetic and painstaking at the same time. How is this possible? Because we are constantly switching from different points of view. However, each one of them is an ordeal of suffering (especially for the haters of LB that have stupidly stuck with the story for so long... either they have no life, are very, very hopeful, or are too ashamed to admit that they, too, love this story).    Bottom line - things HAPPEN in this book. After the turd that was 'The Remnant', where virutally nothign of note happened, 'Armageddon' puts all the pieces on the board for the final battle in 'Glorious Appearing'.    I should also mention that the title may be a bit misleading. This book simply introduces Armageddon, and the first few battle of the great war; 'Glorious Appearing' is the grand finale where it all happens.    In any case, thumbs way up for 'Armageddon'",

I returned to college to further my education this year after working as a High School Chemistry and Biology teacher for the last 5 years, and your text \"Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac) 8th Edition\" is the required text that we are using for my Quantitative Analysis course.  Myself and numerous other students in the class have found ourselves completely exasperated with the text for numerous reasons.  Some of the reasons are as follows:    1. Formulas written incorrectly, while the definition/derivation is written properly right next to it, or vice versa.  2. Incorrect answers to the end of the chapter questions given in the back of the book.  3. The end of the chapter questions will often have no previous examples shown in the chapter, or in the chapters prior to it. Essentially there is no guide or basis to begin a question.  4. Asking for something in a way that is so convoluted that one has no idea what is being asked.  5. Suddenly using or asking for a term that has never been used in the book. Such as asking for \"molar solubility\"...nothing in text as to referred, nothing in the index, and nothing in the glossary.  6. Your solved examples within the chapter are atrocious, in that they are of virtually no use when trying to use them as a guide to the end of the chapter questions. And thank you for skipping/not showing steps or assuming things in the problems when they are shown.    These are great given that one comes to consider the questions, Did I make an algebraic error in solving? Was the formula given the correct one, and was it even given correctly? Did I do it correctly, and is it just the wrong answer given in the back of the text?    I have taken into consideration that I have been out of school for a while and that I may not be as sharp as I used to as far as some of the more complicated calculations, because I have not had much practice recently, however, when one is trying to learn from a book that makes it so hard to do anything with it, it makes it about as useful as a paperweight, which is about the best use I have for it now. A $100+ paperweight.     I thought that the mistakes were due to an early edition text, but with a simple view of the front of this book one can readily see that this is the 8th edition...the EIGHTH edition! One would think that after writing the same book 8 times, these errors and some general refinements may have taken place; thank you for the exception to the rule.     In all my years of school, I have come across many books, both used to learn from as well as ones to teach from, and I have never found a more poorly done text.     We, the students and professor, have created a website solely dedicated to the errors or oddities that we have so far found in the text: Needless to say, it continues to grow.     I will say that it is nice to see you incorporating Excel and other software into the text, which is beneficial in its use in Industry and presentation.    Thought you might want to know...thanks.",

Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book.  It did not keep my attention.

The author of the chapter 1- Robert H.Heusen is sincere at p.2 saying that other local ethnicities were indigeneous to the area where Armenia was established much later-e.g.the Khaldeans,the Urartians etc.;that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.I would add that Strabo in the Ic.wrote in his Geography of the World that the Armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the Iberians/Moskhians; this is in vol 5 of Strabo,the Loeb Classical Library edition in 1936;this is the area where the Republic of Armenia was created in 1918.I recently learned that its name was planned to be 'Republic of Erevan'(not Armenia) and the League of the Nations promised to the government of Kartu i.e. Georgia that the creation of Armenia in Caucasia was a temporary measure-F.Nansen from that League of the Nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the Balkans and that soon the League of the Nations would move the Republic of Armenia and her Armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of Turkey-to the Mediterranean.These facts are known from materials published by F. Nansen available in English and some translated into Russian now on the web.The creation of that republic and that of Azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names:the Iberians,the Moskhians,the Kardi etc. R.Heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before World War I,the Armenians were a minority in what became the Republic of Armenia in 1918.After reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page \"a map of the historical Armenia\" encompassing greater territory than the Great Britain.R.Heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.The term Armenian Plateau is frequently used by the author.It is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.Moses Khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.It is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called Pseudo-Moses Khorenatsi.I have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications,in unpublished archives of Prof.Mikheil Tamarashvili known as Michele Tamarati in Rome and Paris.Many authors in XIX century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him:among them Mr.Lenormann,Ilia Chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the Mkhitarist congregation in Venice- Western Europe for spreading false information.'Gate of Alans' (p.152)usually has a better term in historical sources:the Gate of Aragvi.Metsamor mentioned at p.49 is the distorted term from Kartu term 'Metsamuli' meaning 'Cherry colour'-as nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.This Kartu/Kartuli designation was given to those clyffs,the nearby village and the river by ethnic Kartu population millenia ago before aliens-Armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees,others as invaders accompanying alien armies.Authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient Persians,Greeks,Romans,Kartu(Shota Rustaveli,History of Kartly,Dionysius the Areopagite,Georgian Chronicle(p.242);myriad of modern authors and those of XIX-XX cc.The book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic Armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the Republic of Armenia in 1918(itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation that has created a kingdom including the territory of that area in much early days),but to the region'greater than the Great Britain'.Still I give to the authors of this book 'excellent', i.e. 5 stars- for excellent misinformation",

Most notably, Mac McCorkle and Mike Padillo, the restaurant owning duo with more than a passing knowledge of the dark arts associated with international espionage.  Twilight at Mac's Place transpires in and around Washington, DC during the month of January, 1989.  George H.W. Bush has just been sworn in as President. The third person narrator helpfully reminds us that Mr. Bush is the first President to have previously served as Director of Central Intelligence.  That interesting bit of information helps to set the mood for the tale of cloak and dagger intrigue that is about to unfold.    A man named Steady Haynes dies suddenly of natural causes the evening before the inauguration.  Though never officially an agent of the CIA, Haynes has spent most of his career unofficially facilitating the carrying out of some very nasty things on the Agency's behalf all over the world.  When Granville Haynes, Steady's son and a former LAPD homicide detective, comes to Washington to attend his father's funeral, he learns that Steady had let it be known that he had recently written his memoirs.    It soon becomes very apparent that there are people out there who do not want Steady's manuscript to ever see the light of day.  And they are not above commiting murder to see that it doesn't.  The complex plot of Twilight at Mac's Place revolves around the younger Mr. Haynes, with the help of McCorkle and Padillo, uncovering who the anonymous literary suppressors are.    This very appealing book contains plenty of the byzantine twists and turns Thomas is famous for.  Moreover, there are plenty of interesting characters and the dialogue is unfailingly smart and entertainingly clever.  Recommended to those readers who like their political mysteries laced with sophisticated humor and an insider's view of the way Washington does business.",

She even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent, and what isn't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute.    The main character, Rose, is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town, but nobody wants to give her a break because they don't understand what she does as an aromatherapist, and mistakenly think she is a prostitute! As she settles in, she begins to fall in love with a local, who is going through his own relationship troubles. However, she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from London. I couldn't stop reading as Rose tries so desperately to make the right decision, faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter!    A definite must for any fan of Carole Matthews, or British chic lit",

            "input": "McJihad vs. Reality . This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.     The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at \"edgy\" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying \"infotainment telesector\"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term \"McWorld,\" which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term \"Jihad.\" Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.    When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world.

In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.    The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.    At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.    The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.    On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.    There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.    Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.    As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention.",

IMPERIAL WOMAN is the fictionalized biography of the great Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of China. The story starts with her as a beautiful Manchu teenager who, along with her cousin Sakota, is picked for the emperor's crop of concubines. Through guile and ambition, Tzu Hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control. When the emperor dies young, Tzu Hsi makes sure she and Sakota are named regents for the young child emperor.     Through keen intelligence, intrigue, and whatever other means necessary, Tzu Hsi holds the imperial throne through her son's childhood. Buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire, rather than what I gather is the historical feeling - that Tzu Hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in Forbidden City. Through all the machinations and years she is aided by Jung Lu, her former betrothed and the love of her life.     The Dowager Empress has the ultimate power, but Buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the Forbidden City. She is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in China, when it is besieged by western nations and ideas. The infamous Boxer Rebellion is the beginning of the end for Tzu Hsi, and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved Jung Lu.",

A middle class family has high aspirations for obtaining upper class status and this `class consciousness' controls everything they think and do.  Despite their foolishness, one can't help but feel sorry for each character (with the exception of the mother) who continually finds failure and disappointment.  The characters are not developed to the point that I usually enjoy, and there are quite a large number of characters.  An interesting thing about the characters is, none of them are `good.'  Probably the closest thing to a good character is Virgil's Boss, Mr. Lamb.  But even he is a business monger, ultimately concerned with his own business.  This reflection on man is insightful.  In real life, are there any people without flaws?  Major flaws?  Even the Bible presents the heroes of the faith as people with big problems (King Solomon was a womanizer, David was a murderer, Peter was a coward, etc.).  In general, people are selfish.  Our motives are selfish, and our own desires drive everything we do.  However, often fiction reflects one or two main characters who are flawless.  In an attempt to make characters likable- reality is bypassed.  This doesn't happen here in Alice Adams.      I believe this book is about expectations.  The Adams' family lives in the false hope of a brighter future, all the while neglecting the life they are currently living.  I feel that this is the same discontenting experience that Westerners face.  Maybe this is even a reflection of the way the author wrote the book- seemingly slow, but with flashes of brilliant foreshadowing which gives hope to the reader that something more grand is on the horizon.       The story is interesting because of the absolute stupidity of this family, and the fact that it probably is a very real experience for many. The story, though slow, is written very well, and was very easy for me to read (a plus for me, I am a bit slow).   It is also interesting because even though the story takes place in America- it seems a different culture.  This different culture was interesting.  I think the difference came in that the story is supposed to have taken place in the South (a foreign country as far as I am concerned), and it probably took place in the very early part of the 20th century.  One aspect of Tarkington's writing that I appreciated was the way he foreshadowed things.  Maybe I appreciated the subtle foreshadowing hints because of the drudgery of the story, but whatever the reason- I think he did an excellent job.",

In an age when the advent of computer-generated sudoku seem to be taking over, Matt Gaffney responds with this very eloquent and entertaining exploration of standard crosswords and how they are created.    Gaffney, an experienced puzzle constructor and editor, offers glimpses into the history of crosswords and their attributes, but the real strength of his book is its insight into the effort that constructors go in making gems for puzzlers.     He discusses the way that puzzle themes have evolved over time, the limits of themed and non-themed puzzles, challenges that constructors have posed themselves, and how new-wave constructors have pushed the boundaries of puzzles using technology to help them fill grids and using their twisted brains to find ever-more-intriguing clues.    This book is well written in a conversational style filled with humorous anecdotes and includes interviews with many editors and constructors.    Of most interest to me was a chapter in which four constructors are given partially completed grids and are asked to use their brains or computer assistance to generate \"fills\" that they think are best. The results are beautifully divergent, and the way that judges viewed them and rated them points out that the nature of \"beauty\" in crosswords is still a contested area.    Like Amende's \"Crossword Obsession\" and Romano's \"Crossworld\" this book focuses on a very small field, but the thoroughness and humor that suffuse it make it a strong addition.    This book will offer you insights into puzzles if you are a novice and will generate laughs of recognition and empathy if you are an expert or constructor. I recommend it.    Will J",

Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating.

One only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that, if Gross's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between Jews and Poles, he has utterly failed. Unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles, this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred, freshening the pot. Readers without a more complete history of both the Jews and the Poles are especially at risk. Jan Karski's \"Story of a Secret State\" which was actually written DURING World War 2 and deals with  the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this.    Additional reading should include a comprehensive review of Polish-Jewish relations, beginning with the Charters of Sanctity responsible for so many Jews living in Poland in the first place. When Jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout Europe, the Poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland, where they thrived for many centuries.    The Lutheran armies of the Swedish invasions brought anti-Semitism. Later, Poland was divided by Germany, Russia (with a German Queen), and Austria, an occupation which lasted for more than a century. These countries waged a cultural war on the occupied Poles, determined to convert them to their own.     The Poland of WW2 had only been liberated for a few decades. The equivalent of Ronald Reagan's era to today. Many of the citizens were of German descent and actually aided the Nazis in their fight against other Poles, not only Jews.    And although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable, one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression, poverty and terror. We've seen similar episodes in recent years in the Balkans and Africa and elsewhere. Even the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected Israelis today.    Poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades, after two hundred years of occupation. Pope John Paul 2 was emblematic of that spirit, and Poland's support for Israel and attempts to honor her Jewish heritage, embraced by her youth of today, are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past. The Poland that was once a mighty power, yet never imperialistic. The Poland that was the Promised Land for Jews in the Middle Ages",

So, on what would end up being an long journey, I phoned my local second hand book stores and after going to three finally found one that actually had a copy (despite the others that were 'supposed to have one, miss, sorry').  I couldn't wait to read it, and in two days I'd finished the book.      Now, perhaps it was because my sights had been set so high, or perhaps I expected a well written novel when there was none, but 'Lost Souls' disappointed me severely.  As another reviewer said Nothing, the main character, is possibly one of the most selfish characters I've come across.  I'm fine with selfish characters, I myself loved Lestat of the Vampire Chronicles, but only when they're well written.  We're meant to sympathize with him but I found it impossible to do so.  He is honestly a selfish teenager and even while reading this when I was a teenager I wanted Nothing to come to some revelation.  I found the only character I felt bad for in the novel died early on.  While the rest of the novel was supposed to be tense, or possibly filled with horror, I found I was flipping through without a true care as to what happened to the main characters.  There were a few moments of suspense but nothing too frightful.  In all honesty, the book reminded me of the countless  horror stories that fill writing websites [...]     Overall, I would say it's worth a read if you've nothing else to do and are craving any type of vampire story.

I am in the infant stages of my conversion to Judaism, and this book really cemented my conviction that this is the right decision for me.  I felt that Rabbi Kushner clearly explained what Judaism is all about to him and, in many instances, to me as well.  The chapter dealing with the dietary laws I found particularly helpful and enlightening, as this is one of the most intimidating factors for me in converting to Judaism and living as an observant Jew.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations helped me understand the dietary laws in a different way, as allowing the sacred to enter into mealtimes -- which takes the focus off food -- and I immediately began \"keeping kosher\" to an extent.      I didn't feel that this book slammed Christianity, but I'm not a Christian so my perspective is decidedly one-sided.  I did feel that this is a book about Judaism, not about Christianity.  There are places where Rabbi Kushner compares and contrasts the two religions, but I didn't get the sense that he was saying, \"Our way is better than your way.\"  I DID get the sense that he is a man who feels deeply connected to God, and sees his religion as the source of that connection.  While it's likely that a (relatively) small number Christians would read this book, it seems to be intended for Jews -- a book for Jews about Judaism, written by a Jew.  The references to Christianity did not seem to be an instruction guide on Christianity so much as a way for Jews to understand their own religion within the context of modern American society, which is predominantly Christian.    If you are interested in learning more about Judaism -- what do Jews believe? what is the Jewish religion all about? -- then I think this is a very good introduction.  Rabbi Kushner's explanations are easy to read and understand and at the same time very enlightening.  Don't let this be the extent of your studies into Judaism, but it is a fine place to start",

My big surprise is that virtually none of them mention Koestler's The Act of Creation. This is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity. Attention to this classic is worth reviving.    Koestler examines three types of creativity - Humor, Science, and Poetry. Humor, according to him, is cruel (a valuable insight). Poetry, and other forms of art, integrate oneself with the World. Science occupies the neutral middle. It is amazing how Koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework.    My two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form.    As Koestler describes beautifully - \"..uncovers, selects, re-shuffles, combines, synthesizes already existing facts, ideas, faculties, skills. The more familiar the parts, the more striking the new whole.\" This is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood `on the shoulder of giants'. Even inventors like Edison fit this framework. This is close to saying that instead of thinking `outside the box', link several boxes to each other.    The other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal, but in images. So people see new insights in a dream-like trance, rather than expressing it in language. Language, probably, impedes creativity.     There are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece. Nearly a bible on creativity.",

In my years as a performance improvement specialist to Fortune 100 corporations, 80% of success was not just showing up (like Woody Allen has said), nor is it technical competence and know-how (as our school systems wrongly assume), but rather the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships with our peers, our suppliers and our customers. People get jobs and lose them primarily because their egos are too big to help others succeed. Or as Seger puts it, we need to be \"Connecting, Not Competing.\" Regardless, listen to the interviews with A-listers in any industry.

Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.     A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.     Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!     Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.     Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.     I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \"Bite me!\"     I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.",

            "input": "narrow mindness or just stupidity??? . I want to respond to this book and all voices given.  Some said that it points out how Turks eliminated Greek etc. in the 15th century from Asia. Well, if it should get historical, people would know that Turks already started to settle down in Asia around 10th- to 11th century. The population was getting crowded with Turks than (old) Greeks. Fights have been fought Byzants against the Selcuks. The Byzantiniens didn't like the way Asia was getting more and more full with Turks. Wars have been fought, Byzans lost the war, Ottoman Empire succeeded, easy so far I hope to follow.  Coming to the situation at 20th Century, the so called \"holocaust\" at Greeks and Armenians. Everybody knows that Britain used the Greeks and Armenians to get access to Iraq, which didnt exist as a country at that time, because of oil which most of you should know. Greeks and Armenians were used so British could get more access to Iraq and other nations with a lot of oil, like Kuwait etc.   So, Greeks started to rebell and Armenians, too. Thousands of Turks were killed in West and East-Asia. The answer for ongoing slaughters on the Turkish population was to relocate the Armenians, at East Asia, who made troubles and Greeks, at West Asia. BUT, no body could know who were the trouble makers, so it was decided that the whole population has to move away if Turkey wanted to claim those lands. Greeks did the same at these day Greek teritory, Northeast Greece. Northeast Greece was populated mostly with Turks, but they \"had\" to move because of the killing Greeks did on the Turkish population there, so Turkish and Greekish gov't decided to move their populations. Greek got their populations back from West-Asia, safely, and Turks their own from Ottoman lands (nowadays, Northeast Greece).  OH, did I forget to point out that it was \"normal\" for nations to move away populations of the 'other' kind because of the problem, if more people of another kind live there they were able to claim it. So, even Greece and other nations did this THING, it was normal to do at those times.  So to point out, it is biased, this book. Turks did their best in relocating the whole Armenians but didn't have enough supplies, which ended in couple of thousand of deaths which is still nothing compared to the deaths of the Turks. Yes, it was a tragedy, but every nation has one, even the Turks. The holocaust at Cyprus in the 1900's-1970's at the Turkish population. The unaccounted numbers of violations against humanity against Turks at Bulgaria (19th-20th century), Greece(until the 1980's and 90's), Russia (19th-21st century), Cyprus (19th century-1970's), and West-China(until these days).  People should be more aware of history, and reading this book it was said to see how biased people are against people like my nation, people, and myself.  Armenians living in Turkey have no troubles, I ask myself, why? Freedom of religion was always granted in Turkey. Even these days the Greek gov't doesn't allow a mosque in Athen, I ask myself why? There are orthodox-churches in Turkey.  Hatred causes blindness! Keep an open mind and read a good book which tells the truth story.  A.K",

Of special interest is the attention given the physical operations conducted during the siege of Yorktown.  The author details the types of artillery used and the construction of entrenchments, redoubts and battery positions.

The author has done a superb job of research and his writing, though a bit stiff at times, keeps the reader interested.  The nuts and bolts of the volume are solid with crisp, clear, well-produced photographs and informative, nicely constructed maps.

R&G is all about pace; except for a couple of spots, if the pace isn't almost franticly precise, the end loses its entire effect.

Now that we have had the benefit of over two centuries of historical-critical biblical studies, we might now very well ask:  Where do we go from here?  I would offer that the fundamental working hypothesis of such studies is that \"they made it all up\" and so the scholarly task becomes one of reconstructing that process, but the unquestionable assumption behind it all is that anything, positively anything, is more credible than traditional Christian faith (this is amounts to, for the critical scholars, a doctrine of \"justification by doubt\").      And so the game proceeds.  Canonical scripture is called upon, and even appealed to, when it can be interpreted to support the working assumption that nothing at all is what it might seem when it comes to Christian origins.  But whenever scripture supports a traditional understanding, then it is systematically demolished, discredited, decoded, and rejected as the purely ideological product it most assuredly is.  And all of the other texts, the schismatic, heterodox materials and the Gnostic drivel--which the Church had its apostolic reasons to reject--must simply be seen for what they are, and not evidence of Christianity's original \"denominational\" condition.    Bart Ehrman is a most clever and educated man, but, contrary to what some might assume, he DOES approach the material at hand with a clear bias and set of preconceived understandings.  So let's forget all the by now stale appeals to scholarly objectivity (not to mention, personal integrity) and letting \"the sources speak for themselves\", because that is just so much fantasizing as well.  Traditional Christian faith is dismissed by Ehrman and his ilk as being simply one more product of identifiable historical forces and thus it has no intrinsic claim to truth.  But try reading the Bible with the assumption that it is all true, that what it tells us about who Jesus of Nazareth is, and the beginnings of His Church are a reliable enough account of what did happen.  I realize that such an enterprise is inconceivable to the scholarly guild (with the refreshing exception of people like Luke Timothy Johnson and N.T. Wright), but philology is not faith, and in the end, it should never even be considered as a basis for it.      Ehrman's reconstructions are thus of interest only to a person who would treat any kind of 'faith' resulting from it as a kind of personal plaything, and not as the daily challenge to his own being. Remember, Christian faith is ultimately about God and our relationship with Him, and not about the way in which we might choose to arrange the intellectual games we play with faith and our musings upon it.     If you are interested in keeping God at arm's length and not dealing with real issues of personal growth and spiritual integrity (the kind that comes not from footnotes but from abiding in the Holy Spirit), then buy this book, read it, and enjoy whatever feelings of superiority it might give you.  But if not, if you are seeking the one, true living God who awaits those who would believe in Him through His Son Jesus, who is the Christ, then forget about it and all the other 'ragings of the pagans'.  You see, they are the ones you will be able to spot on the closeout shelf.",

The characters aren't all badly drawn, but none of them really feel complete.  The dialogue is at times atrocious, at others simply frigid.

You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.

He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.    This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.    In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.      While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets.  Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.    The title, too, is misleading.  \"The Moviegoer\" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.      Like the existential play \"Waiting for Godot\" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.     If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.

For many years, food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry, but not these things are starting to surface.    The book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to \"make\" the foods served at these restaurants.  It opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process.    I've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all, probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food.    Since this book came out, there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before.  Reports including additives, trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it's act.    This doesn't mean that fast food is good for you, it just means that Schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that wasn't challenged as strongly as it should have been.    I personally haven't had fast food for over 5 years, but--even that far removed--as I was reading this I felt sick to my stomach.    Read this book and you'll never step foot in McDonalds again.

When I was born in 1945, my mother, a German armed forces helper on the way from Prague (deep South) up to an isle named \"Ruegen\" (in the very North), in the middle of her long journey through a breaking down Germany: she came down with me and, after one day in hospital, she stuffed me away into a children's home (in a town called \"Wuppertal\", West-Germany) - and left me to my fate. So she robbed me (among others) the experience of a childhood in the GDR, German Democratic Republic, \"Wuppertal\" should be \"West-Germany\" (American sector), the isle of Ruegen became Russian sector, behind the \"Iron Curtain\". So I did not learn anything about \"Young Pioneer meetings\", socialism, communism, STASI (the secret police) or summer camps of young \"Pioneers\". In the Western hemisphere I grew up, drinking Pepsi Coke, receiving American Care packages, later on: listened to the Beatles, noticed the students movement in 1968, had no Ulbrich or Honecker, but chancellor Willy Brandt and Helmut Kohl. But I tried to find out the place, where the woman could live, who had born me in that dark year 1945. After 40 years of persistent search, 1985, before the Berlin Wall fell (1989), I found out: She was living behind the \"Iron Curtain\" on the isle of Ruegen. And I started to look at this lost childhood, which I did not enjoy: She showed me her photo album: summer beach near \"Kap Arkona\" at the north-point of the isle, snowy winters on Hiddensee, flight ducks, cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks. Color films (Orwo), books, Trabi substitute parts: only hard to get. Nevertheless, I wanted to make up for my life in the GDR - in 1990 when the Berlin Wall was fallen: A schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor, filled with former Stasi employees (security police) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb \"cadre conversation\", he unfortunately (thanks to the \"reunification\" of East and West-Germany) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now (in hastiest kind). I should return please to West-Germany, where I just had come from. The direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically, out of character, and not recommendable. No \"Ossi\" (vs. \"Wessi\") - no job. As a result my mother, noticing, that all her dreams collapsed, joined an acute epidemic disease at that time: She committed a so-called balance sheets suicide. I was deprived of the chance to become a \"zone child\" a second time. Did I miss really much? Because the book of Jana Hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic \"Ossi\" writings (of course very different to my \"Wessi\"-point of view) are not as superficial, simple, banal, as I thought in the first moment? Compare her point of view ..",

If I could give this book zero stars, I would do it. It plays like an impossible fantasy put together by some stupid 20 year old who reads too many boring teen magazines still. In this book, It plays like a long letter some boring teenager is writing to her boyfriend. It never really feels like a letter though. That is such an contrived way for the author to tell her story. The teacher is never named either. The author describes sex scenes and the student mostly seduced the teacher. It sounds really dumb too. Like the author will go, \"I switched sides I was laying on to look especially sexy for you\" and if you like hearing that same sort of garbage over and over again, I guess this is the book for you. The author tries to sexualize a 14 year old and make it sound like her every movement or thought was about sleeping with her teacher. It was really disgusting that the author would write something like this and it was disturbing too. Normal kids don't think and act this way. It's clear that the author enjoys the fantasy of being just a teen with a adult lover but what she has done by writing this crap is try to make teen girls sound manipulative and over sexual. It's nasty. It's her twenty year old thoughts and words put into the body of a 14 year old for the story. Her story is not believeable anyway. The uncle and aunt never try to find their niece? The teacher never gets in trouble or found out for what he is doing? Not buying it. Also, the book has very many cringe worthy moments such as when she keeps berating the teacher, calling him stupid, encouraging him to sleep with her, yuck.

The author has taken great pains to measure and analyze Vermeer's paintings, finding a striking feature that many of them, when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting, imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures.  The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.    This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.    I think the only real failing in the argument is that Vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality, and therefore not needed the aid of a camera.  As pointed out in the text, he was not bound to perfect accuracy; there are some deviations",

A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative.  Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution.  All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward.  Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping.  The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts.  A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se.  Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad.  The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction.  Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing.  Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read.  Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended",

While this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of &quot;all too common&quot; web mistakes, I have to disagree with the author's conclusions in many cases. In particular, he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible, responsible for poorly written content, lackluster site maintenance and other &quot;bloopers&quot; as he calls them. Fact is, most web developers would love to spend the time &quot;investing&quot; in doing a thorough job. However, in many cases, the client often doesn't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job. While there is enough blame to go around in poor web design, it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes. I also take exception to his commentary at times, in specific, his early mention of Enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company. He points to a bold claim Enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature. While Enron may have troubles, it's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers. We can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point. Lastly, I found the layout to be a little difficult to read. Often, the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about. The book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book.

For fully two centuries, until World War II finally exhausted the potential, the British policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the New World through trade with the Old. This includes the United States, whose loss as a colony severely dented the Empire, but eventiually created the power which has succeeded Britain as world guarantor.    Mr. Herman is good on detail, but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole. He is candid about the problems, both physical and political, and respectful of those individuals who, even in bad times, retained the foresight to keep the navy, and, thus, the Empire, on an even keel.

Certainly some of the articles can get wordy or bogged down in \"technical\" detail, but literary criticism has never been for the reader who wants to skim and get the assignment \"over with.\"  Any critical theory takes time and patience to work through; critical theory questions ideas and requires a commitment on the part of the reader to think, question, and engage with the text.  There are some essays that younger students simply do not have the skills for yet but there are others that are quite accessible to them.  In particular, my students found the essays on Representation, Structure, Race, and Canon very interesting.    This source has one significant advantage over many other texts.  For each article, there is an immediate application of the technique to a well-known piece of literature.  I know that my students reading of Appiah's essay on race dramatically impacted how they interpreted Shakespeare's play Othello and then later Schuyler's novel Black No More.  While neither my students nor I always agree with what the critics are saying, I have found the book a great starting point for discussion",

When I compare the constituents of the Process Areas in Appendix B to the CMMI (CMU/SEI-2000-TR-018), there is erroneous duplication.

The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, \"barriers to entry\" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain \"Competition Demystified\"    With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book \"A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy \". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say \"The end of competition\". Kindly recall \"The end of history...\"    The book however deserves praise for use of  Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy.     Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms.    Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish.",

I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.      I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope",

It tracks the discovery of prions, the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. Following human cannibals in the jungles of New Guinea in the fifties, bovine cannibals of the British Isles in the eighties, and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on, Rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases. I especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists, from the Noble Laureate who so enjoyed the New Guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation, yet brought thirty natives back to the USA and helped them through school, to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he wasn't quite certain what they were.     But this isn't just a story of scientific discovery. As the foreboding subtitle blares, Rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions. These include spontaneous formation, responsible for the known early cases of Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, trans-species infection, including mad cow disease and scrapie, the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response, and hardiness of the disease. One scary factoid: a scientist took a sample of scrapie, froze it, baked it for an hour at 360 degrees (celsius), and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample.     For all the uneasiness this book inspires, it certainly doesn't offer any answers. A condemnation of industrial agriculture, a warning that it's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe, and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue. To be fair, it was printed in 1997--perhaps things are under control now.",

I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians.     This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book.  The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages.    The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored.     I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware.

Apparently, the story of the Hartford circus fire of 1944 has never been told in a book, but Mr O'Nan has dived into the deep end of the myths and legends and surfaced with a factual, well-researched, and eminently readable tale of the tragedy. Covering all aspects of the fire and its' aftermath, Mr O'Nan debunks the stories told as truth but bearing none, reveals new and unsung heroes, and lovingly examines the fate of Little Miss 1565, the lovely, unclaimed child who lay so long in a grave with only a number to mark her presence.    This is an exciting read, filled with the thrill of the circus, the horror of a fire out of control, the fate of survivors, and that of victims ....... both those who lived and those who didn't.    While Mr O'Nan has moved on to the Boston Red Sox in his book with Stephen King, FAITHFUL, this was his first foray into non-fiction, and he has done himself proud. This is a great story, told well, and with care",

The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.    Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.    He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough.",

Kesey's brand of storytelling is highly engaging and makes this book readable in one sitting.  However, he is most admirable for his characters.  The protaganist of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is Randle Patrick McMurphy, a brash and determined young delinquent with a devil-may-care attitude.  McMurphy feigns a mental disorder in order to be moved from prison to a mental ward.  Upon entering the mental institution, McMurphy stirs up all kinds of trouble by befriending and influencing a bevy of mental patients, all with their own interesting eccentricities.  All of this is done to the dismay of the dictatorial \"Big Nurse\" who becomes McMurphy's nemesis.  Interestingly, the story is told through the character Chief Broom who for years has pretended that he is a deaf mute, an aspect that affords him greater perceptability.  I highly recommend this book--it will humor, sadden, move, and excite anyone who reads it.  I have also concluded that--in my limited experience with literature--Randle Patrick McMurphy is the greatest character ever conceived by an American novelist",

The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).

This is an excellent short review of European quest for a language to unite its disparate nations with each other and the rest of the world. I thought that the book did an excellent job of staying on the subject and illustrating the progression of thought in this area. It does confine itself to Europe and time period as defined in the beginning of the book. That is excellent, there is simply no other way to cover as much ground as the book attempts to do, and I feel that it does suceed admirably. As usual, Eco's erudition and research are amazing. This book is published in the context of a European series of books about Europe and I wish there was a similar book series that would cover this ground for Far East and India as well. I am sure people there worked on the same kind of problems. Some of the problems with languages and methods described seem so obvious that one has to wonder what the authors themselves thought about them. Of course, this is a whole other book series. I wish there was a 4 1/2 rating as I do not think this is truly a masterpiece, but certainly a very very good book from a very very good author of fiction and non-fiction.

The story begins in 1830 as young Boone Caudill escapes his Kentucky home for the plains and mountains of the west. He meets up with Jim Deakins, a pleasant country philosopher, early on his journey and finally the experienced mountain man Dick Summers on the keelboat trip up the Missouri.    I enjoyed Deakins' theological disquisitions. \"You can't beat God for bein' picky. No, sir. If he catches you playin' cards or sayin' one swear word...it's to hell with you forever and ever...Even thinkin' is mighty dangerous. As a man thinketh, that's how he is, and to hell with him ag'in. Why you reckon he gave us a thinker then?...God is some busybody.\"    Guthrie takes us up the Missouri, a slow fight all the way, across the plains, into the mountains and back. He creates for the reader the palpable sense of the openness and wildness of the West. Yet the book steps back from fully romanticizing the end of the mountain man era. The story is often disturbing, not the least in Boone Caudill's quick and often brutal ways.    Highest recommendation for anyone interested in the American West.",

It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides.    There are several editions of the full Giles edition available.  Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version.

Dr.Steele is an American Black, a baby boomer, a member of the academic elite, a liberal arts major, and a political \"conservative\".This certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues.    2. I felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated America and during the civil rights movement. His take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of Civil Rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain \"moral authority\" by doing GOOD....and the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts... helps explain some of the dysfunctional after- effects that are still with us.     3. Where I disagree with his analysis - speaking from my own experience and perspective of course - is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the US and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years! And he blames the \"dissociating liberals\" (whoever they are) for attempting to deal with these social issues. Excuse me, but I recall Nixon and the Reaganites being in power for awhile and the Bush dynasty is still with us and I haven't seen a lot of effort being done to get-together and fix things for average folks here in the good ole US of A. Of course pressing the GUILT button in this mainly Judeo-Christian culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention.    4. My point is that by injecting  blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even further.His statement about Red and Blue States was a hoot! How is this helpful? Where are his suggestions for improvement - other than that he thinks Bush & Co. now have the \"moral authority\" that has been so lacking in America? Some might be inclined to disagree.    5. Finally, as a black Dr. Steele misreads me as a white liberal in that I have never felt guilty about my white heritage - only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans - themselves victims of misbegotten religious dogma.If we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process.........and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past,we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer space.Not a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative.",

He was addressing a gathering of concerned and apparently well-heeled citizens in the New York Museum of Art--as I recall.  He had the crowd and the moderator in the palm of his hands.  I found him to be a compelling speaker who obviously was very versed in the subject matter of Iraq.  He seemed to genuinely care about the Iraqi people--and the Amercian people.  His speech and this book was about correcting our \"present march of folly\"--to steal from Barbara Tuchman's fine book title.    This book is a primer on Iraq from Dr. Polk's point of view.  It does offer a \"broad sweep\" of Iraqi history in a mere 200+ pages.  It's purpose is obviously as an introductory historical primer for literate, reasonably educated Americans so that they can understand the basic historical circumstances leading up to the present conflict.  I think he wrote the book to try to change more American minds and effect a change in our present policy.  That change seems to be coming about as I hit these keys.  Both the Iraqi public and American public seem to be losing patience with the present intolerable set of affairs in Iraq.    It's quite unfortunate that some of the Amazon reviewers have so much trouble accepting some very basic facts.  They, like the occupant of the White House and the rather motley crew that surrounds him seem to live in their own separate reality.  We need, as a people, to give up our collective fairy tales about our country, its leaders, and its forever \"good intentions.\"      This is a very approachable book.  Highly recommended for those who have little background in the history of Iraq.  Another very good book that another reviewer recommended is:  \"The Future of Iraq\" by Liam Anderson and Gareth Stansfield.  Their analysis results in the conclusion that Iraq will break into 3 pieces.  Hopefully, in some sort of federated pattern rather than as warring nations.  I remember Seymour Hirsch saying that the three part outcome was virtually inevitable given the circumstances on the ground in Iraq.  He based this on his sources in Iraq.  He made this statement in the spring on C-SPAN.  Seems quite prescient.",

Ms. Choquette comes across as a charming, friendly person whom one would love to have over for dinner. She writes about her parents (especially her mother) and how her large family was close and sort of quirky. She describes her early psychic experiences and her training with two teachers who open her abilities up even more and teach her about life.     The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the descriptions Sonia gave of clients, mostly from the 70s -- lime green hot pants, bouffant hairdos, tie-dyed t-shirts and platform shoes...those were the days...how did anyone get a date back then?      The only criticism I have about the book is that Ms. Choquette  mentions several times that her family was Catholic and religiously so. I do not doubt her family's religious sensbilities, but the Church teaches against almost everything that Sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation, clairvoyance, ascended masters, divination with tarot cards, spirit guides, etc. I don't think it is possible to be a Catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the Church and be a New Ager as Sonia is. She also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way, but she also needed to pray the Our Father. The rosary requires the recitation of the Our Father at least 6 times, so I was confused when Sonia said she then began to pray the Our Father as well. I wonder what rosary she was praying.",

            "input": "An HR Managment Tool to share with those \"special employees\" . There are employees who we know are smart and they conflict in any number of ways with management or with others within the organization.  This book helps HR managers help their business owners and corporation shapers get into the thick skulls of those  special employees that are shining stars on the verge of becoming supernovas.  Corporations many times are charged with terminating an employee or facing the challenge of having an employee that is extremely talented terminate their employment, only to find out that this is basically unnecessary if they can successfully negotiate the behaviors of the employees so that it better serves the businesses' need, not just the narcassist needs of the employee.  Yes, they work hard, but the company is in fact compensating them for that with the cars, cash and other perks they so successfully earn, and if they didn't perform, wouldn't earn those things.  It's time that business managers and their HR people  take back their responsibility and partnership of helping build successful employee careers by sharing with them the challenges and insights they face in building their companies successfully.  Fortune 500 executives face these challenges, just as smaller companies do.  Get Out Of Your Own Way At Work helps these supernovas realize before they self-destruct their careers, someone elses or far worse, the business' success, where they may be playing the part within this challenge, not just passing the buck and blame over to others, or taking advantage in ways that end up blowing up in their faces, making a mess of their futures or the company's.    I triped over this book as an HR manager searching for tools to help my business owner/manager successfully navigate a similar problem.     It should be required reading for all entry level employees (along with another favorite of mine \"The Rules of  Work and The Rules of Management\" .   Because employees step out of the academic world usually and then enter the business world, there are no hard fast rules, even if you attended an executive business university to guide you in how to manage yourself in the environment, or were raised with the self-disclipine required to be successful in the business world.  These tools  of knowledge are like boot-camp for entering the business world.  HR folks suffer in silence trying to help these people and because its really up to them to get the business procedures and policies of the company when told to them,  this book helps communicate to them what they don't get or what businesses usually don't think they need to communicate during the hiring process because any other behavior is cause for disciplinary action.    The behaviors described in this book suit all types of industries and organizations.  Dr. Goulston explains it so brilliantly and seamlessly, it's clear what our choices should be if we still exhibit the same behaviors after one is assigned to reading it because there is a chapter within the book about how the guilt of these descision effects us about the tough-love we should make if they don't get it.   For those rare few that your organization seeks to help and no end to the frustruation or how to communicate it to those that create it,  this book is a treasure for growth and  career development within the business environment, no matter what the employee's behavior is.  I believe that if applied the insights within this book can help prevent these behaviors from developing or derail if read early in one's own career.  Even if HR people read it and share the knowledge with their owner/managers, it will tune us and our business owners and corporations shapers into how to recognize it early enough in an employee to help manage to getting rid of it.    If you have anyone in your organzation that sounds like what I've described here, do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK and make it required reading within your organzation",

            "input": "I've give it no stars if I could . Certainly it is not to my dismay that this will be the author's last edition.      Her information is all right in many ways, but useless in most.  If you want drug store quality cosmetics, you can find useful ones, some very good ones.  If you want very good quality cosmetics, more often you will pay for the increased quality.     Ms. Begoun says in the intro to this (hopefully) final edition, that she was hired by a mall in Silver Spring years ago.  Since I grew up in the Silver Spring area and still live nearby, I'd love to know what mall she's referring to.  Years ago there were no malls in Silver Spring.  A few shopping centers, but no malls.      She says she had acne and saw that toners didn't close pores, etc.  She's right in many ways, but she's way off in so many other ways her book is a mish-mash of misinformation mixed in with some basic common sense that anyone can figure out on her own.    If you want the very best cosmetics, you will have to patronize high-end stores like Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, etc.  The professionals there will help you find what is best for your skin.  It may take time, but all depends on what you want.     Ms. Begoun criticizes some very fine lines of cosmetics.  Maybe they don't work for her.  When I look through her book, it may be cleverly written, but she doesn't really know what she's talking about.    I had \"bad skin\" until I began using the Erno Laszlo line.  I had clogged pores, pimples, dry, scaly patches.  After a few months of using Laszlo and continuing to now, people I don't even know comment on how clear and pretty my complexion is.  Strangers don't comment on someone's skin for nothing.    When I see Ms. Begoun's book, I always turn to the section where she rips the Erno Laszlo line of cosmetics.  This edition, she omits what she has written in the past, that Laszlo customers are extremely loyal and swear by the product. There is a reason Laszlo customers are loyal.  It works better than any other line out there if you want your skin to look excellent throughout your life.     I have used Erno Laszlo for almost 32 years and no one ever believes that I am 53 years old.  Of course I don't look 20!  But my skin is smooth, the occasional dark \"age spot\" that appears fades within a few weeks of using Laszlo's wonderful \"No. 3-9\".  My husband is 47, looks younger than 47, and still everyone thinks he is older than me.  My lipline is smooth, lipstick has no vertical lines to bleed into when I wear lipstick, which is daily.      Ms. Begoun in this edition of the book says that Erno Laszlo could not have known about exfoliation or the dangers of rinsing with hot, hot water (part of his system requires 30 rinses of hot water twice a day), but that rinsing does exfoliate and I have no tiny spider veins on my face that she claims hot water can cause.  My cheeks are smooth and while gravity is taking its toll (Laszlo works, but gravity is a very powerful force and I don't expect to look 40 when I'm 70!)    She rips other up-scale cosmetic lines but I think that's because she has a conflict of interest.  Is she selling her own products?  I know previous editions promoted her own line of cosmetics, I didn't bother to find out if she's still doing so.      Erno Laszlo had as his clients years ago movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford - you can read in \"Mommy Dearest\" how Crawford's daughter thought her mother was obsessive in the way she rinsed her face repeatedly each morning and evening!    The reason Erno Laszlo had these clients is because his system works.    It's not cheap, it's very expensive, but it works.  Most definitely, it works.    Last week, I was \"carded\"!  Quite a compliment for a someone who's been a mom for over 32 years",

Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond \"rah rah go read this,\" I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.     I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.     Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.     Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.     Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.     Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.)",

In the fourth installment in Jane Lindskold's ongoing Wolf series,  the heroine Firekeeper, her sentient wolf companuion Blind Seer, and her friend Derian Carter have all been kidnapped and taken to a nation called Loglimi well south of the locales of their previous adventures.  The Loglimish are aware of the intelligence of the 'royal beasts' Firekeeper was raised by, and the creatures play an important part in their religion; so the prospect of being able to establish through Firekeeper better communication with the wise beasts is enticing and, at the same time, potentially threatening to many Loglimi.  As in the opener of the series, Firekeeper's entry into the court, or in this case temple, produces considerable friction.    Firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the Loglimi and their animals; at the same time (and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development) she learns more of her own background.  And there are, of course, nefarious plots underway which require the unique talents of Firekeeper, Blind Seer, and Derian to defeat them.     No time is wasted in setting up the story; the capture takes place before the first page.  As a result, the other continuing characters from the series aren't present at all.  But the removal to a new location avoids the feeling of staleness that crept into the previous volume.  That makes this the best book in this series since the first",

They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer.  Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be.  Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere.    Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it.

            "input": "poetry in Riis' How he oher half Lives . How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.   Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\"  How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  \"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \"education\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  \"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.  Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:  Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.    Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:   Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.   I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?   Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.",

He is just one of those passengers that you can't please no matter what. Is he fussy? Let facts be submitted to a candid world: Quote: \"On the ultra luxury Radisson Diamond, the same waiters that served my partner and me were also serving a table of senior officers and VIPs. Their mineral water was poured from a bottle wrapped in a white napkin; our mineral water - the same brand (how did he know if theirs was wrapped?) -- was poured without the napkin.\" Holy cow! Mineral water without a napkin - How dare they! At the same sitting, the author complains of a fish head that has fish eyes staring out at him and, guess what, the fish smells fishy! That's an earthquake! More complaints: The food isn't any better than a three star hotel! (Ever stay at a three star hotel in France? The food is super.) More whines: The VIPs get special treatments and special parties (Shocking!), the music around the pool is too loud, too rap and hard rock, the free wine on board only costs the cruise line only $2, he cracked a tooth and the cruise line wouldn't pay his dental bill until he got a lawyer friend who obtained the money plus \"a meager compensation.\" But the thing that bothered me the most was his inconsistency. He berates the industry for alleged mistreatment of their employees and yet he himself seems to cause those employees more trouble that 99% of the other passengers and he can't figure out why those employees, like the bartender on page 157, whom he nagged for several days, hate him so much. He berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution, yet he himself has taken (and presumably will try to take) multiple cruises. The massive improvements in waste management and sanitation and pollution control and fuel efficiency are dismissed as not enough. He nitpicks about occasional oil spills but fails to mention that according to the US Coast Guard 99% of the oil pollution of the seas comes from natural sources, mainly undersea vents. But what's this? The author's website which is billed as a \"noncommercial site regularly updated with links to reports, investigations, and new developments regarding labor, ship safety, and security\" is not functioning. The website isn't function just the way this book isn't functioning. The best treatment for the likes of him is to throw him overboard or make him walk the plank.

Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.    Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.         A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.     And also, if the final \"twist\" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.

If you're not already familiar with Boris' work - well, you probably are whether you know it or not. He has done years work of book covers for Edgar Rice Burroughs, as well as reams of posters. The one constant through all his work is passion for the human form and human power, both male and female.    These paintings range from the lush and sensual to humorous or macabre. A hookah come to life has a demonic presence, but a bar of soap come to life (and licking the bather) is more charming and a little silly. Even the simplest pictures have overtones - that bather is truly a beautiful woman, leaving me just a little envious of such close contact. Maybe not envious either, but off in thoughts of my own. And the preface is right, 'erotic' is much too simple a word for all the different feelings and combinations of feelings that come from having or holding a strong, healthy body.    My only complaint is a sameness in the female figures presented. The faces are beautiful, long and elegant, but mostly the same. The figures - the one figure, really is beautiful, but I value the uniqueness of a figure and the differences between figures. Cloning can serve a narrative purpose, certainly, but sameness wears. Even the loveliness of Danielle Anjou, acknowledged as a principal model and collaborator, wears.    Boris is the master of the figure in fantasy art, and has been for many years. This is a great sample from an earlier time in his career. It's almost impossible not to like.    //wiredweir",

I know there's no such thing as a \"perfect\" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists.

These are very important books in that they shed light on the mythology of the American Left, according to which Europe (Western Europe, that is) is the Promised Land. Since they detest America, they need to find some model to emulate. Well, on closer inspection Europe is not it. Today's Europe had been left hopelessly behind. It lives off the corpses of the past, and having been given a sense of security (by the American foreign policy and its military might) and illusion of prosperity (originally spawned by US economic aid and today dependent on US spending power!), they feel superior to the US. Anyone who ever debated angry Europeans will quickly discover that the superiority is really a reaction to their profound inferiority complexes.    Disregard the one-star reviews. An M. McDonald below claims that the book is \"short on facts\"... This from a guy who claims that Germany is the world's largest exporter... Forgot to mention though that it's the larger exporter of MERCHANDISE. If you add services, the US exports are at $1.15 trillion vs. Germany's $893B. And, thanks to diversification, the US is less vulnerable to global economic slowdowns. McDonald's is wrong. He's wrong about public education too: Europe's schools are \"vastly superior\"?...Does he have any idea what goes on in the schools of Paris, London and Rome?? he says China not seen as a threat to EU? Anyone who's been to Italy recently, with interests going deeper than gelato, surely must have seen numerous campaigns against Chinese textile imports. My bet?

            "input": "Baseball's  Odd Couple . John McGraw and Christy Mathewson became two of baseball's most recognizable personalities with the arrival of the 20th century.   McGraw made his name initially as a third baseman with the scrappy Baltimore Orioles in the 1890's.  Mathewson was one of a very few college players, and found himself being tried as a first baseman along with pitching for the Giants when McGraw was brought to New York to lead the Giants for the next thirty years.  Author Frank Deford manages to weave together these two diverse personalities as each left their imprint on the game during their short lives.  McGraw died at the relatively young age of 60, although his bouts with the bottle made him appear much older than he was.  Matty died at the youthful age of 45 due to tuberculosis, probably the result of breathing poisonous gas during a drill among soldiers while in France during World War I.  The information provided on the old Baltimore Orioles can be found in numerous other books, most notably for me, Fred Lieb's history on the Baltimore Orioles as well as the information on Mathewson in other books.  However, I feel Frank Deford does a good job in tying together the lives of these two giants of the game who became great friends as well.  For all his crustiness, combativeness, and profane mouth, McGraw, who experienced tragedy as a young boy by seeing his mother and several siblings die of diptheria, had a sentimental side to him.  He hung three pictures in his office of his favorite players (Christy Mathewson, Ross Youngs, and Mel Ott).  The last sentence is not included in the book.  Following his playing career Mathewson became manager of the Cincinnati Reds.  He suspended one of his players, Hal Chase, because he believed him to be involved in fixing ball games.  When Matty returned from France McGraw offered him a job as a coach on the Giants, only to find Hal Chase now a member of the team.  McGraw had difficulty adjusting to the times as he bemoaned the modern (at that time) player, while the stature of his old Oriole teammates grew with the advancing years.  You can find a lot of the information on these two baseball legends in other individual biographies, but this book will bring these two giants and close friends together in one well done (if you will) dual biography",

And come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin (the cat) more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys. Though even as a cat lover, I got sick of hearing about Muffin and the other animals which were way too many in the first place.    The book did go on and on, too much description about the ordinary (and, oh so cliche at times!).I didn't like the way it jumped between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, I just found it awkward. It didn't give the chance to really get inside Judd's head (I mean, it was \"his\" story after all).     I couldn't love or hate anyone in the book. It was hard to tell what their motives were and \"who\" the real person was inside them. They seemed so in-and-out of character. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies? I'm not sure. But without love or hate, there's really nothing left to feel as a reader. Left to chose between a ditzy mother, a jerk-of-a-father (but not a jerk enough to hate him or care about what happens to him), an eldest son who is like a prop in this book, a brainiac son who gets revenge only to disappear and become someone completely different without warning or reason, a victimized daughter, that you can't really feel all that sorry for, the youngest son (also a prop), I'm not sure who to root for (if anyone).    The worst part was, just when I started warming up to the book (forgiving its flaws, hoping for a great ending), I was hugely let down. It took me about a week to finish the last 2 chapters because the end of the book just dragged and I found myself too tired to pick it up. We are told in a quick (but ironically again, long and tedious) after-the-fact fashion about what has become of Marianne and then in the Epilogue everything is \"wrapped up\" quickly and neatly with no realism whatsoever. I feel if you're going to resolve things in the end, then RESOLVE them---Tell us what it is and how it came to be without just glossing over everything. The book was long enough; some pages should have been assigned to the ending instead of all the fluff in between. This is a book that should make you cry, but I felt nothing (and I am one of the biggest crybabies ever).     If you want a good book about family and family secrets, read Ann-Marie MacDonald's \"Fall On Your Knees\" or \"The Way the Crow Flies\" instead. Both excellent books.",

His thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark, but they usually stimulate and inspire. In this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters. Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler , Augie March have vivacity and life that Dean Corde does not.  The Dean's wife too falls short of Bellow's livelier and more appealing feminine creations, for instance the Ramona and Madelaine of Herzog. So too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of Augie March, and Henderson, and even in its way, Herzog. This book is really a winter book, and it has coldness and dying in it. And it has the oppression of the Communist Iron Curtain world in Romania, and the depression of Chicago's most beaten and desperate streets. The characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas.   Again this is not one of his best. Far from it. But it is Bellow and because of that a worthwhile read.",

But this is the cover of this book and points to what is really going on here. The argument is simple, had Zionism not existed there would be no Arab-Israeli conflict.  Had Israel created a Palestinian state, that he Jordanians refused to from 1948-1967, there would have been peace.  The entire onus for any conflict in the middle east rests with Israel.    This is an interesting argument. Israel is unique in being one of the few states created by an ideology, rather than an ideology rising out of a nation(rather Zionism rose out of the Jewish nation, but not in its present borders).  However it is not the only example.  The Risorgimento in Italy is responsible for odern Italy and in a number of other pleace latent ideologies have done the same, creating nations out of loose federations.  After all modern Moldova has little historical merit and neither does Kosovo.  for that matter most of the borders of the Arab states also arise out of modern ideology, especially the borders of modern Turkey.    Only apparently in Israel is this a problem.  The reason is remarkably simple, only in Israel did the creation of the new state result in 50 yeas of warfare.  Other 'old' conflicts like that over Kashmir are likely a result of the same.  But we do not readily argue that the existence of India is responsible for the Kashmir conflict.     It would be hard to imagine the title of an book about another nation being 'the case against ..' for instance 'the case against Germany'.  Therein lis the illogic of this book.  A case cannot be made against the existence of a state.  There can be no 'case against Japan'.      Even if all the arguments are correct, the solution, the disappearence of Israel as a state, is not only genocidal in its intentions but illogical in its premise.    Seth J. Frantzan",

            "input": "Colonial conspiracies and drama . Similar to other books in his US history series, Vidal engages the reader immediately into conspiracies and dramas by introducing a wide panorama of characters. Vidal is able to use Burr's assistant, Charles Schuyler, as the chief storyteller, allowing the narrative to skip around through time. Vidal likes to have the narrator tell the reader that the past \"isn't like it is now,\" which he would not be able to do if the story followed a strict chronological series. Characters are given incredible depth as they all have their dark faults to go with their heroic strengths. Vidal takes shots at the big guys. Some shots are substantial (like saying Washington was a poor leader who never lead the Army into a victory and only won the War because of France) and some are petty (Washington repeatedly viewed as having a \"big butt\" and often referred to as \"waddling\"). Jefferson is especially scrutinized. Besides the ubiquitous presence of light-skinned slaves insinuated to be of the Jefferson line, Jefferson is portrayed as a cold, calculating \"philosopher king\" who uses the constitution when it supports his causes, but calls for \"states rights\" when the constitution contradicts him.    Aaron Burr, who despite all the nasty politicking going on around him, is portrayed as a gentleman who is constantly antagonized by his peers for trying to do the right thing. How he obtains so much power in the state of New York is not really pursued except to say he is a war hero. Also, Tammany is often mentioned in the background, but Burr's involvement is not pursued. However, Burr is always described as having control of the New York constituencies that he can influence when making deals with the Virginia \"junta.\"    My only negative critique is I find it hard to believe that Burr was vilified by conspirators without having character flaws that might have contributed to his rise and fall.  Burr is always the benevolent gentleman while the other power mongers of the day (Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience. Vidal freely flings the mud at other historical heroes, but seems a little too defensive and paranoid about the reputation of Aaron Burr. Still, the book is rich with historical vignettes of Burr's meetings with various patriotic heroes. Vidal writes with enough veneration to let you know the characters are great and enough vindication to make them real.",

Having many authors, instead of just one, gives this book an advantage over one author's opinion. It was definitely written to spark an emotion in everybody to make change. The book's topic effects and influences everybody in some way in life to make a change, even if it's just within themselves. It succeeded in doing so. The book analyzes the factors in our culture, which promote and support not only rape, but also sexual assault, and harassment. It also presents ideas and methods to end it.

            "input": "Self-Loathing, Self-Doubt, How Can A Child Love Herself? . This was the first book I've read by Toni Morrison, and it did not disappoint. The story takes place in Ohio in the early 1940s - before the Civil Rights era, before Martin Luther King, Jr., and before Rosa Parks ever stayed seated on the bus. The story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood. The other black girl, Pecola Breedlove, comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic. Pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes, as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful.    Naturally, the story involves much more than this, and Toni Morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and doesn't release them until the final page is turned. Ultimately, the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within Pecola, but within an entire community, an entire race. Pecola's story is not a pleasant read, yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child. She begs to be nurtured.    Many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a \"black\" book, but I disagree. The idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people, to my way of thinking. However, Toni Morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them, that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages. No child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are.     A very moving book, highly recommended.",

I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.    I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose.

            "input": "Daring new way to teach C++ - successfully! . After having read this book I very much regret coming to C++ from a self-taught Pascal and C background - it could have been so much easier. Many introductory texts on C++ assume a background in one of the procedural languages and consequently start teaching the C subset of C++ first. This is, according to the authors' experience, counterproductive to understanding 'proper' C++ and programming true to it's paradigms and design. Thus they follow the radically new approach of discussing whatever (sometimes advanced) facilities C++ offers to solve a particular problem instead of going from one isolated language feature to the next. This leads to the somewhat unorthodox chapter sequence, which teaches the design of user types (classes) after introducing template functions (a feature many seasoned C++ programmers still don't know how to use effectively) or even stranger: the explanation of pointers and arrays (chapter 10) in terms of the standard library iterators and containers, which have been introduced as early as chapter 3. What I particularly liked are the useful and real world examples, although the book does cover the omni-present 'hello world' program, it otherwise fully delivers on it's promise of teaching 'practical programming by example' (subtitle). Due to this approach and the well constructed exercises at the end of each chapter the book gets the student writing non-trivial, useful programs taking full advantage of advanced C++ library features almost from day one. The authors also lead by example and show proper commenting and programming for flexibility techniques even in the smallest code fragments. This is in refreshing contrast to many an author's crime of showing the 'quick and easy' way first and the 'proper' way later.  If you read The Design and Evolution of C++ you'll soon notice the repeated mentioning of Koenig and Moo as two of the key players in the development of the language. Their in-depth knowledge and experience really shows in this work. Although the book is mainly aimed at beginners, veteran C++ programmers can still profit from it, even if only by loosing some more bad old C habits",

Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.     I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:    In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.    Love is worth fighting and dieing for.    Love is stronger than evil.    What does not kill you, makes you stronger.    Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.

The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)    Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.    The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is.  Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)

Its 87 brief pages are readily accessible to high school students, and useful to anyone interested in offering correct evidence and valid reasons to support conclusions.  When so much of what we read, hear, and see is intended to persuade us, or even mislead us, it is important to distinguish valid arguments from careless or manipulative ones.    If good writing is clear thinking made visible, then this book provides excellent advice for writers. As a rulebook, it begins by presenting 30 rules for clearly constructing a valid case supporting your conclusion. It then turns to applying these rules for writing argumentative essays. It also treats fallacies and includes an appendix on correct use of definitions. The author recognizes this book is only an introduction to these topics and provides a good list of further reading.    Fallacies are seductive and often go unnoticed and unchallenged. In this book, many fallacies are described alongside the rules they violate. A short chapter then names and briefly describes many types of fallacies. I would have liked to see this expanded. We have long recognized sexist and racist language and work to purge it from use. I look forward to a time when a broader set of fallacies will be routinely recognized and corrected in everyday conversation. Perhaps then it will be common to interrupt the speaker to say something like: \"Excuse me, but you just used the fallacy of modus ponens by affirming the consequent. Please correct that logic error before proceeding.\"",

The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as \"i suggest somebody to fix that\" and \"saves typing later\".   If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent \"Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics\" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try \"A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music\" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of \"Musical Applications of Microprocessors\" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- \"Digital Audio Signal Processing\" and \"DAFX\"- in that order.",

In _The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance_, Bruce Fink delivers a clear and comprehensive account of the notion of the subject as it operates in Lacanian theory and clinical practice. The book's focus, of course, is much broader than this: this is a text that could serve as a superb introduction to Lacanian psychoanalysis, to be read while studying _Ecrits_ and the Seminar.    He begins by elaborating Lacan's ideas on the subject's entrance into language and the rules that govern the language as Other. Then he goes on to explicate the implications of this for subjectivity, ethics, sexuality, and psychoanalytic theory--all the while staying true to the clinical roots of these concepts. Fink provides clarification through the use of great examples, easy-to-follow schemas, a few of his own case histories, and by referring back to Freud's classic cases.    This book really helped me understand some key issues in Lacan's theoretical constellation. If you need help wrestling with Lacan's texts, _The Lacanian Subject_ is recommended. Also recommended: _A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis_ and _Lacan to the Letter_, both by Bruce Fink",

Most contemporary philosophers of mind (Sprague, Strawson and Hacker, among others, excluded) have rightly dismissed the soul, but have decided that there is something \"mysterious\" about consciousness, or perception or emotion, or what have you.  In response, Bennett and Hacker have shown what \"consciousness\" really is: the conscious acts of people existing in the world.  This is why we know that other people are conscious actors: they do conscious things such as watch birds, or play chess, or eat ham sandwiches.      If Michael Tye's or David Chalmers' or Colin McGinn's problems of consiousness (e.g. that I can know that you feel the same pain that I feel, or that you see the same color that I see) are indeed problems for you, you should read this book; if it doesn't prove to you that they are not problems at all, at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions",

Few of them have a happy marriage.  Most (I didn't said all) men go there to find woman will not have a good marriage for several reasons,  1. Some men are pigs and going to find a woman in other country is an escape. They should change the way they treat woman. I know many Russian woman who had to flee from their American husbands.  2. Some American man will be deceived by Russian woman and think they getting into lasting relationships while woman want to get to US to get a permanent residency. Especially when age difference is more that 10 years. Why younger woman would mary much older man? Money and opportiunity most of the time.    I know christian man who was looking for a bride in post USSR country. He was in his 50's. Very religious man. But when it came to relationships, he is looking at 20- 30 year old woman. They (women) were disgusted just to think of being with him.    The are other guys who went to Russia. They were sitting on a curb in front of University. They weren't shaved and didn't look appealing. They would pick a beatifull young girl and would try to start conversation. Young ladies wouldn't even pay attention. Then old drunk lady came by and start talking to these american guys. And that's who would entertain these men. Russians don't sit on a flor and only drunkards sit on a curb.  I think anybody who says that Russian woman better than American has never digged deep in the U.S.A. There are also many Russian woman who stuck up. How will you, comming from a different country will find out what is gold and what is not? Go there, learn the culture, language, live there for 10 years and then you might be qualified to mary Russian lady.    I'm sick of a man who goes to other countries for the purpose of marying someone just because they see problem with woman in their own country. These man has a problem that they need to deal with before they can have any relationships. They need therapy, counceling, they are bossy and they are the ones who stuck up. They need to learn how Jesus treats the church and even died for it. Will you give up your live for the one you love? Or you only interested to satisfy your selfish desires",

This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, \"Have you fed your baby breakfast today?\" then you may like this book.     Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love.

Rice (who sadly passed away at the end of 2002) displayed a flair for evocative imagery, but his poetry is so confusingly random that it's almost impossible to decipher.        The first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism (comparing melons to a woman) and odd morbidity (\"It is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce\"). But in the \"Some Lamb\" section, Rice delved into some deeper, more real turf: the death of his daughter from leukemia. \"We stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see.\"        With an actual focus, Rice's poetry shifts into aching confusion, describing his daughter's illness, death, and burial, all the emotions that came with it. Unfortunately, Rice's poetry doesn't improve after that, including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little, Rice's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical. \"The iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers...\"       Dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem. But Rice's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible. \"Golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack, assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers?\" he announced at one point. Okay, whatever. Maybe it's about death. Interpret that as you will. While his poetry can be intriguing and seductive, most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together.        Certainly Rice can't be faulted for his lack of description. He could evoke astoundingly weird, Dali-esque images. The problem is, they seem strung together like beads. Rather than focusing on one and exploring it, he seems just to have tossed them together randomly, assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection. \"Thunder no more, sky/big sandwich gold & coral\" -- it doesn't evoke anything by itself, and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it.        An overview of Stan Rice's poetry, with a stretch of new material, \"Singing Yet\" doesn't shed any more light on what went through his head. Nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing.",

As an avid reader who has a book in almost every room in the house including the garage, bathroom, and who reads during ironing, doing homework, or waiting for sugar to boil for making English Toffee, I can almost assuredly recognize not only genres but also the various nuances within the genres. JUst as women in this day and age tend to head towards tough broads who can fend for themselves in a man's world, Janeway brings in a cop whose adoration of written materal causes him to leave his probably more steady job as a policemen, to enter the world of rare books. An occasional job will bring in enough money to support his chosen lifestyle for a while, but more than that, his introduction into the interesting and secretive world of bibliophiles. These books not only whet my appetite for this world, but also introduces me to both real people and real books that helped to shape our world from behind the scenes.     Janeway's current flame has an old friend (who also delved into books) killed, and she wants him to find out who did it an what t he motive was. In doing so he ends up becoming involved in his lover's old friends and flames, so of which should be left undisturbed. But Janeway never  is one to back down from a fight over 'rights and wrongs', and he doesnt' do that in this book either. I get the feeling when I read other reviews that the readers want something less complicated than what Janeway provides. If uncomplicated is what the readers want then they should go to other books, becasue there are times in Janeway's books that you just have to go back and understand why certain things are said or done in a true historical background and reality.     I wish Janeway could write fast than he does, because I thoroughly enjoy these very educated mysteries, but then, if he did write that way Janeway would not be as enjoyable as he is.    Karen L.

The book is very up front about contradicting the seemingly widely held (western) view that Taoism is largely about attitude and how you live life.  This book is not about philosophy.  The book is concrete how-to advice about practicing Taoism in a traditional manner.  Different sections explain how to make your own altar and wand to use in rituals, why taoists should never participate in felatio, and introduce a whole pantheon of dieties to worship.  It would also make a much better source for a school report about a religion than a philosophy text would.    In general, I found the book interesting but not what I needed.    From the start, I was turned off by the tone of the book.  The introduction takes the attitude that new agers are messing up Taoism and people interested in it as a philosophy should get lost.  It makes some pretty broad declaratory statements about how all Taoists live their lives, and tries very hard to push a \"one right way\" to being a Taoist.

But she has to write her autobiography, and if there ever was a useless tome, this is surely it. Though well written, the reader will quickly come to the conclusion that there is nothing really to write about, nothing that couldn't have been captured in a magazine article for the New Yorker or the American Scholar, that is. I found it a surprise that she was, indeed, an existentialst, for she is surely among the most repressed people on the face of the earth.

It may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with Henry Roth's \"Call it Sleep\" which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness.

The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation).

Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:    1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.    2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.    3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island \"mystery\" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.    4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.    Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.",

If a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that Adams makes about Thomas Eakins, one would think that the artist was homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, and a pedophile, exhibitionist, voyeur, sadist, and masochist; and further, that he practiced incest and bestiality (all of which, Adams suggests, was driven by a desire to posses his own mother).  Take your pick!  Adams covers all the bases. Eakins is not so much \"revealed\" in this book as he is \"concealed.\"  He seems to ignore altogether, what to my mind, are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man: that he studied logarithms for fun, that science, not art, was his first love, that he was conversant in five languages, and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness.  Among the more humorous assertions that Adams makes about Eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor (he used an easel), that he shot his sister's cat for fun (Adams conveniently leaves out the fact that Eakins' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid), and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses, which supposedly reminded Eakins of outfits his dead mother wore.  After reading this dreadful book I came to actually like it as a study of how inbred (dare I say incestuous?) that some members of our academic community have become.  Even if you are convinced, or want to believe that Abraham Lincoln was homosexual, you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously",

Far from bashing Jefferson for his views on blacks and women, Appleby apologizes for him, and basically agrees with her negative reviewers here that we should not judge an eighteenth century figure by twentieth century standards.    Appleby has a remarkable feel for the politics of the early Republic, and does a brilliant job of recreating for a modern reader exactly what the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans were fighting over.  She makes a strong case that Jefferson stood for democracy, against elitist opponents who sought to exclude common people from voting.    The core of her argument is that Jeffersonian republicanism is at the heart of our modern conception of democracy, and that both contemporary political parties -- the Democratic and the Republican -- draw equally on his legacy.  An important argument to remember in these partisan times, and it gives us hope that we can overcome our current profound divisions",

I'm in the proces of moving to Boston, so I didn't want chapters and chapters about hostels and tourist meccas and Boston history (for that, I'll buy a real book). Mainly, I wanted something I could use to get myself around the city and figure out the neighborhoods (looking for an apartment from a few thousand miles away isn't that easy, let me tell you, espcially when you have no idea where all the places are, and the local bookstore wasn't stocking any 'Moving to Boston' books). So this little black guidebook, hiding out behind Frommer's guide to New England, was a blessing.      The main difference -- and advantage -- this guide has over the others is that it is map-based rather than text-based. Each section of the city has about three maps in the book, one showing essentials (banks, hostpitals, landmarks, libraries, schools, and of course, donuts), one showing Sundries/Entertainment (bars, coffee, copy shops, gyms, liquor stores, movie theatres, restaurants, and shopping), and a final covering transportation (subway, bus lines(!), car rental, and parking); of course, all the streets are labeled as well.       This alone would have made me buy the guide, but behind these maps, the guide discusses the parks, convention centers, ballparks -- and provides floorplans for them if you ever want to buy tickets for events. It has listings for universities and colleges, it explains the commuter rail, Amtrak, how to get to the stations. It has a full page of 24-hour services!! (Something I've found severely lacking in other guides) It lists libraries, hospitals, police stations, Boston movies, books, songs, art galleries, it has floor plans of theatres!! Three pages of bookstores! A full street index (like in the best city maps, London A to Z), a fold-out highway/driving map of downtown... gasp. This is possibly the most perfect guide to Boston I could think of, the guide I would have written and designed if I were a guidebook writer.      And one of the best, coolest things is that there is a little elastic band on the back cover so you can hold the thing closed (and, by extension, put stuff in the book and then keep it there so it's not falling out, like in a Moleskin notebook, if you know what I mean. Very useful for notes and reservation sheets and tickets).      The book itself is extremely compact, probably 5 by 7 inches (?), which means that the type is very small (I'd estimate about 7pt?), so that might be the one thing some people might have a problem with. Myself, I am a big fan of the size (of the guide and the font) because then there's just that much more you can fit into a small space",

            "input": "What's Beneath Your Syntactic Interface? . Maggie Balistreri's critique of our masked, substantively evasive dialect offers humorous, albeit troubling, insight into how much of the social fabric, the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes, are entrenched in mass denial, subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common, everday conversations and exchanges.  Think of it as speaking in riddles. Unfortunately, it's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse.      This particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level, to the extent that it's accepted as 'normal'.  Let's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness, a soul sickness; isn't it possible, even likely, that over time, a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ...*as a disease?*   And by that postulation, wouldn't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick, weird, bad, wrong, etc?     With people generally unaware of this process(and likely uninterested in it)they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient, or at least insufficient, mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception, mass deception, and in turn, self and societal censorship.      This elaborate process largely stems from the \"Just Do It\" corporatized mentality. The underlying, strategic message of \"Just Do It\" is DON'T THINK. That is, don't think beyond the superficialities of life: of a mindless, wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism, and all it entails to define human worth and \"success\" on such terms.    When people don't think beyond those terms, when the customary, daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities, often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy, fear, anxiety, the result is an unthinking, non critical, homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought, genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged, enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis.   Logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency, its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are, allowing for a delusional, happy consciousness. Language reflects this.    My take on what Maggie is addressing in her book isn't a random social trend, and that there isn't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person's overall intelligence or vocabulary; it's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous, corporatized values.   The proof is how corporate power, which is basically the hierarchy of government, so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity.   The greater the degree of ignorance, apathy, and general disharmony, the greater profits to be made from human misery, and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified, perpetuating the cycle.    The psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so.  If they're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import(something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite)than naturally, the people's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset.    \"Loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul\" ~ Mark Twai",

            "input": "Excellent Book---Highly Recommended . Though I have since made a career change, I realized, as I read this book for the umpteenth time a few weeks ago, it was one of the driving forces in my decision to become a counselor.  Many times I have seen in families, the battered women and children I've worked with and counseled, the need to love and be loved, to not be lonely. We are told that we will become more lovable as we choose the right clothes, perfume, shampoo, even toothpaste!  The list of products, guaranteeing that we will have would-be lovers banging at our door, that we will never be lonely as long as we buy these products is endless.  Our media-oriented society measures lovability by: popularity, sex-appeal, the right clothes and products.  Living by these standards alone makes us lonely, especially if we can't live up to them.  These standards are only masks, hiding us from not only our inner selves, but those of others as well.    Marie, the main character in the book \"Daughter of Earth\" struggles with her loneliness.  She wants what we all want - to be loved and not have to prove that we are adequate enough to be loved. \"Marie lives out her whole life struggling to act as a whole person - to give and receive love in a relationship of equality - and to work against oppression - despite the image that inhabits her imagination.\"    From a very young age, Marie learned of the world's contradictions.  She learned how devalued women were, \"that even male animals cost more than female animals and seemed more valuable; that male fowls cost more than females and were chosen with more care.\"  With the birth of her little brother, Marie realized how important a son was for there was much celebration as cigars and whiskey were passed around.  She also saw how the lives of those in poverty were worthless and that \"the companies\" these people worked for only cared about the profit they were making rather than the lives and safety of their employees.  \"Coal was dear...life was cheap.\"    As Marie watched married women around her, she realized that the \"love expressed in sex enslaves and humiliates\" them.  \"It is the toll men exact for giving economic protection to their wives.  The weeping of wives - what is more bitter?\"  She sees women become powerless as wives and mothers and she in turn seeks a relationship that is equal in giving and receiving love.  She does not want to be like the women in her childhood that have lost the power to make their own choices.    In two relationships, Marie thinks she has found the equality she's been looking for. However, in the end it is not even so: \"To her comes the memory of many women who have loved, suffered and remained true to the one man who did not love or remain true to them; to her comes the memory of a man who betrayed many good women for the sake of the one woman who detested and was cruel to him.  She thinks of the great loves that seem to have been great because they were hopeless; of the night that follows the day; of love and hate that are separated by less than a hair's breadth.  And she things of annihilation that irrevocably follows creation.  But above all, she see that she has had to pay with her life's love for the experience for which she was least responsible.\"    It was through a man named Sardarji, that Marie learned what it meant to love and be loved.  And through her experiences with him she learned that love means to get over who we are because of our culture, our values, or the decisions we make.  Through Sardarji, Marie \"touched for the first time a movement of unwavering principle and beauty...and saw that difference of race, color and creed are as shadows on the face of a stream, each lending a beauty of its own; that subjection of any kind and in any place is beneath the dignity of man...\"    Sardarji taught Marie that we can't live without loving all humankind; that we must do as Sardarji told Marie: \"Make conviction the basis of our actions.  We must fight for what we believe in rather than fighting for something we know nothing about or for something we are told to fight for.  We must think about what it means to fight.  We must know what we are fighting for before we able to help and before we can enlist the help of others.\"    To break the vicious circle people get caught up in when they try to prove they are adequate to be loved takes knowledge.  For as Marie says to Sardarji, \"knowledge without love is useless.\"  In order to love all humankind \"we need to know how others suffer; and if we have already known, that we should not forget.\" To love without loneliness means that we need to \"experience in our hearts again and again the suffering of the dispossessed.\"",

Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.    Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:    1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.    2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.    3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.     4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, \"HCE.\"  This was Joyce's way of \"getting at\" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.    5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.     6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.    If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: \"How many puns and themes can *I* find?\"    This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.",

Both are sharp-witted, female New Yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners. Yet, if Parker could be considered a painter of the urban American landscape in the 1920s through 1950s, Lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s. I don't think she has Parker's depth or sense of structure. Her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin. And she often relies way too heavily on puns. Several pieces in this collection fall flat for me. Yet others - such as her advice to heiresses, \"At Home with Pope Ron,\" and \"The Last Laugh\" - were quite clever. I think she's worth reading as perhaps one of the leading humorists of her generation. Comparisons with the more versatile and compelling Parker are a bit of a stretch, though",

I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.     My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.     I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's \"normal\" and women just need to get used to the idea",

The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.     In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.    This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.    Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.    As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.    My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book",

There are lots of made up animals, I'm assuming  to account for the rarity of animals beginning with &quot;Q&quot; and  &quot;X&quot; etc.  The part that I don't like is the fictitious  &quot;Uglybirds&quot; whose action is simply &quot;Being Ugly&quot;.  The  illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very  disturbing.  The &quot;Uglybirds&quot; have atypical bird features that  seem intentional.  They are green and purple, and have messed up feathers  and big bulging eyes and are very &quot;Different&quot; from the  &quot;normal&quot; birds in this and other books.  Upon reading this, my  wife and I agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to  our daughter.  Although I do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness  (Racism, Violence, contempt, etc.).  I think that it is a quality that  shouldn't be used to describe physical appearance.  When my daughter  encounters a person who is physically unusual, I hope that I have instilled  in her the values to disregard what others might find &quot;Ugly&quot;.  I  know that some might think that I'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in  a child's book, I think that parents need to be more careful about the  messages that they are sending about ugliness",

It's not a book that tells you Dos and Dons, rather a journey of an American pastor who was preaching about marriage, sex, love and God in Africa.  I am especially impressed towards the end of the book when the good Christian African man, Maurice, asked weather if he was wrong as a 30 year old virgin to dumb his ex girl-friend because she was not a virgin.  Good for Maurice to stand firm before God against temptation.  But there are too many Maurice, justifying women who have a different path of life, which might be so wrong, but in needed for forgiveness and acceptance.  The books raises a lot of tough and true questions, which sometimes is hard for us to even form.  For me, it was tough for me to explain to my boy friend why I think it is problematic for him to not think about marriage, and keep saying that he will seek God first.  It's contradictory.  Do you not love a child because you want to love God first?  Both can come as a practice.  Practice how to love God and humble ourselves in marriage.  To serve one another, the best way to display our love for God.     In the book, another character, Fatma, a beautiful young women, just like the Samaritan woman who met Jesus on the way to the well written in the New Testament.  She and her 6 ex bf/husband, and still living with another man, non of them is her husband.  This beautiful woman could not see a way out, do not find a place in God even though she was searching.  This story of Fatma is also true to many women who became a Christian later in her life or was lost on the way as a Christian.  How women like that may think the best way out is to commit suicide, because her body and soul are wounded, so wounded and dirty, that, abandoning it is the only way out.  This is the best book so far I have read about sex, forgiveness, marriage, love and God.  It's not a self help book, but I would recommend to anyone in any age.",

After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room.

While surfing the Internet one night, he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities, where you can talk to other people who are also gay.  And amazingly enough, there's a boy he meets with the name GayTeen-- who not only lives in his town, but also attends his high school.  Another gay boy, in his very own school?  There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school.

The same is true for Russel's friends Min and Terese, who although they claim to just be really close friends, are actually in love.  So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club.  After all, no one else is going to want to join such a boring club--especially if they knew it was just a front for a gay/ lesbian school group.    As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life.  And that sometimes, no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open, you're just not ready.    GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great, quick read from author Brent Hartinger, about the ups and downs of daily high school life, and the struggle to find ones identity",

I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of \"evil\" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.    Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts?  no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a \"barbie\" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.    All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read.",

The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it.

Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in \"good\" and \"evil\" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.

She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way.

I have heard a lot about Richard Matheson, and when I found out he'd written a survivalist fiction story (a favorite sub-genre of mine)I was elated to read it.  However, after a long arduous struggle to continue reading, I realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected.    \"Hunted Past Reason\" tells the story of two men: Doug and Bob.  Bob, a writer, wants to write a novel of backpacking.  Doug, the expert, is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade.  Right from the start, we are privy to the personality clash between the two.  Doug starts out as a \"know it all\" to Bob.  He tries to bludgeon Bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness.     As the story progresses, we see Doug's jealousy of Bob's successful career and family life come to the surface.  I must admit that the subtle changes in Doug are blended very well into the story.  On the other hand, the story was dragged out far too long than necessary.    After philosophical discussions between the two (which are strained at best), we see Doug's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two.  After a graphic rape scene, Doug gives Bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into \"Deliverance\" (as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out).    The writing seems to be quite repetitive.  The mental conversations between Bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out.    Being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction, I was mildly entertained by the reading, however, I expected a bit more from Matheson (simply because of his fame and influence he's had on other writers ).  Maybe I was a bit unfair, but the other reviews tell me otherwise",

It is a time when Portugal fought the ruthless French, maintained an important colony in Brazil, and was constantly under the threat of the Holy Inquisition. The King of Portugal, Dom Joao V, desperately wants an heir to the throne. One night he promises a Franciscan friar that if he can foretell a succession to the throne then he would build a convent in Mafra. After the Queen gives birth Dom Joao V fulfills his promise by building a convent that is destined to be the greatest in Portugal. Meanwhile, after losing his hand on the battlefield Baltasar travels to Lisbon where he eventually meets Blimunda while watching public executions of condemned individuals. An eccentric Padre Bartolomeu Lourenco recruits Baltasar and Blimunda to work in secret creating Passarola, a flying machine that resembles a giant bird. Centuries before the modern airplane is created, the act of flying is often beyond the comprehension of individuals and could be seen as a holy sign. The sections of this book detailing the plight of Passarola are most entertaining and fun. This creates a good balance with the harsh details of the building of the convent. Saramago succeeds in writing entire passages revealing how much work and sweat were involved in such acts as dragging a giant slab of marble a considerable distance. One might think these passages are dull and tedious, but I believe Saramago highlights these arduous aspects of life that are often ignored by other authors who create works of historical fiction. Throughout the years Saramago has solidified his reputation for being a wonderful storyteller who create novels that are both shocking and revealing of the human condition, and BASTASAR AND BLIMUNDA is no exception.

I found this book unsatisfactorily casual and slap-happy for the work of putative been-there-done-that expert with such lengthy tenure in and around things ufological.  Yet, by reading this, I did manage to concretize a philosophical system that has been emerging for years as I read one UFO book after another--while also reading widely in other things paranormal, as well as a spate of less abstract fields, such as history, science, linguistics, anthropology, and such.  Let us posit that aliens (1) exist; (2) have the technology to visit remote star systems; and (3) took greatly enhanced interest in earth only when it developed weapons systems capable of either harming other civilizations (i.e., in combination with its rocket technology) or of destroying itself (which would constitute a crying shame from the viewpoint of fundamentally beneficent aliens who respect other sentient life forms).  Keyhoe leads me to believe--amid his conspiratorial musings and his subtle hints at what was meant by what was really meant by what Mr. X thought that Mr. Y intended--that they are watching us and executing a hands-off policy until such time that we pose a direct, immediate danger to ourselves (this will occur long before we pose a direct and immediate danger to exocivilizations), at which time--Starfleet-style \"Prime Directives\" od non-interference notwithstanding--they will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the harmonious continuation of our culture. Whether that means utterly conquering and enslaving us, or surreptitiously seizing control over certain key organs of our governments (possibly to include forging certain elements of the whole-earth government whose existence Einstein endorsed as a logical and necessary eventuality), or just providing cultural \"guidance counselors,\" who can really say.

Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized \"servant girl\" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for.

The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions.",

This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.     The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the \"normal\" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: \"I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee\" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.     Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.     I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.",

At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the \"fate\" of the church in America. So much \"commodification\" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be \"ecclesia\"? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to \"change\" the church in order to meet the people where they are at?   I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more \"prone\" to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture?   Our self-centered culture always asks the question \"What does this mean for me?\", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos",

Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.    The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.    Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.

Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.    After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.    There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of \"why?\" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.

It's expensive and there are some annoying things about it--for example, the paper is soooo thin you can practically read the recto on the verso--but it is all-around the edition I turn to most often.  The Riverside (I'd judge it to be the other most commonly used anthology) is absolutely ungainly.  Its paper is certainly better, but the thing is absolutely huge.  Looks great on the shelf, but horrible to carry with you to class. I also dislike the Riverside's two column layout and system of notation, which puts notes and glosses at the bottom of the page without indicators in the text. The Norton puts glosses in the margin, which I find infinitely less disturbing and more likely to be helpful, and it numbers footnotes.  It also uses a single-column layout, which I find much easier to read and allows a smaller paper size (same size as all the other Nortons out there, same Bible paper too) without a smaller font size.  The introductions to the individual plays have been farmed out to some of the best in the biz, so it's not just Greenblatt's book.  For what it's worth, his job on the introductory material in this volume matches the quality of what you expect from one of the leading figures in the field.  What's more, the scholarly material is very readable and generally helpful.  Yes, the take of that material is definitely influenced by new historicism and cultural materialism, but anything compiled in the last 20 years is likely to be similarly influenced.  There is also some good theater history help here and some good old facts.  If you have problems with the Oxford edition, then you'll have problems with this one.  If you don't, then it should be fine.  For what it's worth, I reallllly like that there are the three Lear texts.    This is a volume than can just be read if you want to read Shakespeare.

I used the book to recreate my own version of the spreadsheets, and the extensive explanations in the book helped, mostly, to make sure that I got the underlying formulas correct.  What I noticed, however, is that the book sorely needed a financially sophisticated editor.  For example, the spreadsheet on page 193 has an entry for \"Expense/Foot.\"  In fact, this entry is none other than the OER - Operating Expense Ratio - that was developed in Chapter 6.  Why go to all the trouble to create and define ratios, if you aren't then going to use them.  Other parts of the spreadsheets were equally problematic.  For example, the Net CF's - presumably \"cash flow\" - for a 3 year exit only had the receipts for years 1 and 2, and not for year 3.  Lastly, the book has nothing to say about (a) maintaining and growing a real estate portfolio of multiple properties as opposed to a single property, or (b) evaluating the relatively new 1031 multiple tenants in common investments that some long time owners are trading into in order to stop being a full time property manager as well as an investor.",

If you ever have a problem with your child's behavior, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is the one to call.  Her outrageous solutions to common child behavior ailments seem to work well.  In most cases she recommends letting the child wallow in his or her own awful behavior until rock bottom is reached.  Only then is the child aware of the real-life consequences for bad behavior.    A perfect book for teaching personal responsibility.  Not to mention it's filled with fun names like Mrs. Moohead, Mrs. Broomrack, and Mrs. Crankminor.  My only complaint is Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle herself is present for only a very small percentage of the book, and the book ends without even going back to her.  I was thinking (and hoping) she'd be on every page.    This goes to show you, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, who loves kids more than anybody, still lets them bring on their own suffering when it comes to correcting a major attitude problem.  If a kid doesn't want to eat...shoot, let the kid starve.  If the kid doesn't want to pick up toys, then let the kid get trapped in clutter.  Show kids what it's like to have to clean up their own mess instead of cleaning up their mess for them all the time.  (This doesn't apply to diaper changes of course.)    In addition to the elaborate Piggle-Wiggle cures, the kids in the book get a spanking from their parents every now and then, especially after playing around with the laundry chute.  Sorry kids, can't do that",

The book covers the period of 1780-1835. However, the author on multiple occasions refers to the Civil War period. Too much \"bouncing\" around throughout the years.     Yes, she does quote portions of historical letters but I felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer's point of view without actual facts cited.    The writer's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors, which she refers to frequently in the book, are deplorable. Why mention them at all.

I am \"Norse Wiccan\" but luckily I did not base my Tradition on this book!  (I was forwarned before doing so!)    For those interested in building a Wiccan Tradition that is Norse or Germanic based I suggest the following books:     1) Wiccan: Beliefs and Practices by Gary Cantrell     - Not Norse, but a very good Wicca 101 book to serve as       a blueprint.    2) Witchdom of the True by Edred     - Shows how Gardnerian Wicca has its roots in Traditional       Old English \"Wiccecraeft\" and the Cults of the Vanir from       Scandinavia who worshiped the \"Lord and Lady\" (Freyr        and Freyja)as there primary deities. YOU HAVE TO READ        THIS BOOK!!! It's availible from Runa Raven Press. 3) Hammer of the Gods by Swain Wodening     - This is a book Anglo-Saxon Heathenism, but if read the       above book, you see why it is nessesary.      4) Germanic Heathenry: A Pratical Guide by James Hjuka Coulter     - This is the ultimate book on Germanic Paganism. A must       read!    5) Northern Mysteries & Magick by Freya Aswynn     - Aswynn is Asatru but with a Wiccan past, so her stuff       tends to be more on the \"Vanic\" side. Worth a read.      Using the above books, one can build a \"Norse Wiccan\" Tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of Norse/Germanic Paganism, instead of the \"fluffy bunny\" and \"New Age\" stuff that Conway does with this book, which is basically a reprint of her Celtic Magic book with the names changed to Norse Gods and Goddesses",

Having read the Bagavad Gita, it only much later dawned on me that Carlos is Arjuna and Don Juan is Krishna - only the wisdom is completely different.

Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - \"Karma for the Complete Idiot\".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan \"nuggets\" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite  and material trappings. And so has the Bagavad Gita",

Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \"strongest/purest\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \"perfect\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.    Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \"the deathbed edition\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.     I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.     To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The \"true\" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers..",

Ackerman believes that the true strength of an organization is reflected in its identity, and its ability to use its identity to drive the creation of products and services that provide value to customers.  Ackerman posits that there should be a cycle between the identity of the company and the profit it generates.  The wealth produced by the identity of the organization should feed back into the identity that creates it.  The author has outlined a set of guidelines to identify value for the organization.  Ackerman calls them the Laws of Identity.  For example:    1. The Law of Being:  \"Any organization composed of one or more human beings is alive in its own right, exhibiting distinct physical, mental and emotional capacities that derive from, but do not transcend, the individuals who make up that organization.\"    2. The Law of Individuality:  \"An organization's human capacities invariably fuse into a discernible identity that makes that organization unique.\"    3. The Law of Constancy:  \"Identity is fixed, transcending time and place, while its manifestations are constantly changing.\"",

Throughout the novel Lainey is dealing with her husband being in a coma after a freak accident along with taking care of her two daughters and helping her neighbor cope with a failing marriage. I cried along with Lainey and smiled at her happy moments the entire time keeping the faith that Lainey's husband would one day wake up along with her. For any fan of Berg or any reader interested in a truly great book, I highly recommend Range of Motion",

However the text neither is \"practical\" nor gives you the \"in-depth-analysis\" you were hoping since its title begins with \"Advanced\".

Reading John Simon's latest compilation of film reviews begs the question, does one have to be \"right\" to be a great critic or can simply writing cleverly and rigorously in defense of a basically incorrect critical assessment suffice?  What I have always admired about Mr. Simon is his unflappable way of sticking to his own view irregardless of the popular/critical consensus surrounding him.  Yet Stanley Kauffmann tended to give negative notices to many of the same films as Simon while writing more sympathetically, insightfully and fairly about the works, so where does that leave Simon?  Out in the cold I'm afraid.  Reading this latest Simon book is exasperating as he snootily dismisses one great film after another (Au Revoir Les Enfants, Saving Private Ryan, etc.)  I finally came to the consensus that however good a writer he is, he is simply too far off the critical mark...too often.      Simon has a famous reputation for been gratuitously nasty toward female actresses whom he doesn't care for the looks of and that continues in this collection.  As another reviewer notes, this latest collection also appears to solidify his reputation for being a homophobe too.  Going all the way back to his review of Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet in 1968 (where he accuses the director of being a [...] because of the nude love scenes) to his recent review of My Own Private Idaho which he quickly dismisses as a \"homosexual fantasy\" his reviews have had a nasty homophobic edge to them, something Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael or Roger Ebert's writings have never had.  And the fact that he liked Outrageous! (about a drag queen) back in 1978 and Savage Nights (about a bisexual HIV+ Frenchman) in the 1980's doesn't absolve him in my mind for all the nasty remarks he's voiced elsewhere over the years regarding \"homosexuals\" (he never uses the word gay, it's always \"homosexuals\".      Simon's writing is just as caustic and technically proficient as always (and he still loves providing untranslated foreign quotes) but all that effort is at the expense of all too often unappreciative and skewed critical views.  For my money, the essential critics remain Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Stanley Kauffmann and David Thomson, soon to be joined by Anthony Lane of The New Yorker",

Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the &quot;Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses&quot; form (&quot;To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.&quot;) asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. &quot;You didn't come by when I had the money,&quot; &quot;I didn't have a stamp,&quot; &quot;I'm dead.&quot; A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants.

Truman Capote (1924-1984) was born in New Orleans to a wastrel con man father named Arch and a southern belle floozie from Alabama whose name was Lillie Mae. Lillie Mae and Arch divorced shortly after Truman's birth in New Orleans. The fragile child was raised in a succession of relatives homes. He was happiest  in Monroeville, Alabama where his next door neighbor was Nellie Harper Lee (Lee was the author of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and  served as Truman's girl Friday on his trips to Kansas to cover  the Clutter murders turned into his best book \"In Cold Blood.\"    Capote was effeminate and was a [...] man who had several lovers many of whom used him for money and travel. Capote (he took the name of his stepfather Joe Capote who ended up in New York prison for his dirty business accounting!)spent a sybaratic life  of jet setting in the watering holes of Europe, Asia and the  United States.     Capote was famous for his books, his talk show appearances on television, screenwriting and adoration of his \"Swans\" (such  rich dames as Kay Graham of the Washington Post; Jackie Kenedy and her sister Lee and most notably Babe Paley wife of the President of CBS News.). Capote's famous 1966 Black and White  Party of the rich and famous is still a landmark event in New York society annals.    Capote was only 5'3\"; had a babyish voice and squandered his talents with works planned but never written such as his unfinished novel \"Answered Prayers.\" HIs reputation rests on  \"Breafast at Tiffany's\"; \"In Cold Blood\" and many excellent short stories.    Truman Capote could be manipulative, was spoiled and lived the  life of a famous, spoiled and egotistical man. His death came after years of booze, drugs and sex in seedy places.    Clarke's book will sell well in the wake of the famous movie  \"Capote\" and deserves to be read. Capote like F. Scott Fitgerald before him wasted his talents and died at a relatively young  age.     Gerald Clark has written a well researched, gossipy and accurate account of the life of the southern boy who became  famous and then was extinguished by his demons . A tragic  and cautionary tale.",

            "input": "One of the best books on tai chi . This book presents the 24 and 48 posture tai chi form. The 24 move form is good for busy people, but the 48 move form is even better because it combines movements from the 3 most popular styles of tai chi, Yang,  Wu, and Chen, so the student gets some background in each. At 150 pages long in large paperback format, this book packs a lot of info between the covers. For example, I learned that in addition to the Wu style, there is also a W'u style, which I didn't know, although I've studied both Yang and Wu style tai chi.     The author gives a brief introduction to tai chi in the first chapter, discussing basic concepts and information, then proceeds to some classical Taoist philosophy. He also tells some interesting stories about the founder and his sons, who had many adventures and exploits, and various stories and legends have grown up around them.     Next there is a separate chapter on chi gung, a subject that has become almost a requirement for a tai chi book, I notice. However, most of the book is taken up by athe chapter showing the martial applications and the 48 move form. Dozens of applications are shown, and the photos are clear and easy to understand. I found this the most enjoyable part of the book, as there are still postures I don't know all applications for, such as snake creeps down, and the author presented one on that.     There is a chapter on guidelines for tai chi practice that gives detailed instructions for how to use the different parts of the body, from the eyes to the feet in performing the form. I found this useful because sometimes I still forget some of the fine details of how to hold the body when I do the form.     Finally, there are several appendices which provide a list of the 24 and 48 postures and their translations, a glossary on Chinese terms that is more complete than most, and a brief bibliography for further reading. The book is well written and easy to understand even when discussing some of the more abstract and esoteric principles. There are two mini-biographies of each other, two prefaces by two different masters, and a preface by the notable Dr. Yang Jwing Ming",

There are many reasons why World War I has been labeled THE GREAT WAR: it was the war to end all wars in the minds of those who lived through it, who were directly and indirectly affected by it, who continue to reference it as the war with the most emotional cost.  In times when wars seems to constantly queue since that inception of world war, wars spreading  from WW II, through Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Balkans, Eastern Europe, Spain, Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and on, taking a long hard look at the Great War will hopefully center our attention on a past time that can be analyzed and from which we can hopefully learn.    Now that Jay Winters' brilliant book 'Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning : The Great War in European Cultural History' is available/affordable in paperback, every household should have a copy as children grow into the years of this century.  Winters' examination of the devastation of WW I and the ways in which it informed all of the arts, the architecture, the literature, films, memorials - the people of the globe - is a mighty assignment  and he is more than successful in humanizing his message.  This book overflows with photographs of places, faces, bodies alive and dead, paintings, sculptures, film stills - each of which drives home Winters' powerful message.    Sad though it may be to admit, war is a part of life on this abused planet: the more we study it the more we hopefully will reduce it.  Winters wants to make sure that we remember, that we read, view, walk through, see, hear, and listen to the remnants the Great War left behind.  This is a powerful, necessary book and should be required reading and viewing for us all.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, August 0",

I think it was the tell-me-don't-show-me style of overlong explanations of the beauty and wonder of the universe that might have been significant in this regard.  Unfortunately academicians haven't quite got the hang of how to make countless acts of procreation throughout the history of life sexy nor have they been able to capture the mystery of the ever-shy rainbow.

After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be.  Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others.  I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination).  What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world.  Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull.  I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent.  But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did).  She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her \"coolness\" factor.  Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either.  If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy.  If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick",

Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time.  The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there.  However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information.  So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a &quot;history buff&quot;.  From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book.  The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful.  On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner.  Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book.  However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts",

            "input": "ruined by its ignorance of female sexuality . I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.     It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.    Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the \"mental life\" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of \"woman\" or \"man\"; and so on.     Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.    Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's \"wrong\" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing \"that kind\" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward \"druglike\" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.    Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a \"user\", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a \"user\".)     It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.     This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a \"real\" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.     A woman who lays there \"unfeeling\" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.    On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he \"spoilt\" her.     As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.    These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and \"perform\". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.     Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men \"want to hear\". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being \"sexist\". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not \"come to the crisis\" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.     It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as \"intimacy\" and \"connection\", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.     So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman \"should\" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.    There's a lot of talk of \"tenderness\" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow \"lacking tenderness\" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.     I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.    For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.",

None of her characters reveal any depth or texture. What little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy. Instead, what you get is exaggerated, absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence. Richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references, precious oddity, and patronizing first-person narration. Incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished, then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art. The word that best describes the whole thing is &quot;shallow.&quot; It's as if Richter were writing moment-to-moment, giggling over her cleverness, probably sipping an Orbitz because it's &quot;so stupid, it's sublime.&quot; After smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job (I'm looking down at my watch), perhaps Richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for Blind Date",

Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful.

Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on \"nutrition.\" Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's \"nutrition\" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a \"sugar addict\" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term).

            "input": "Bad Journalism . One of the more interesting topics in this book is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  While there is much more in the book than this portion, I think Huband's treatment of this conflict is so far off that it compromises the entire work.  And Huband begins the section by quoting an Arab who says that although Israelis say they want peace, they do not really want it.    Well, what are we to make of this?  After all, we know that the Israelis, good or bad, do want peace and do need peace.  They spent the past several decades building up a nation.  And they want to keep it.  That is one reason they need peace.  And that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace, just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook.  But just as fish need food, Israelis need peace.    Huband didn't say that.      But we know that Israelis really do want peace.  We know that if Israelis are innocent victims, they want peace.  We know that if Israelis are guilty thieves, they still want peace, just to keep their illicit gains.  What does it mean for Huband to imply that Israelis do not really want (or do not really appear to want) peace?      Well such a claim is surely a falsehood.  But more than that, it is a taunt.  After all, suppose a bully decides to beat you up.  And suppose that bully claims you want to fight!  Obviously, you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up.  What the bully is saying is a taunt.  It's more than a mere falsehood.  It is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims.      That means that Huband's book is taunting Israelis.  That's not a very good thing for a journalist to do.  It goes beyond telling mere falsehoods.    Huband also implies that Jews have taken Arab land, and admit to it.  And that they have taken an Arab country!  I wonder which one?  And I also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes \"taking\" it.   After all, we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805.  Not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today.  Have we all stolen the planet from them?  Of course not.  We have bought it and inherited it.  There has been some theft, but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today.    Huband implies that the Arabs ought to have a greater right to steal Jewish land than the Jews do to own the land they bought at high prices.  That's bad journalism too.    And there's more.  The author calls former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an \"extremist.\"  Now, I might understand making some snide remark about former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who after all was a former leader of the Stern Gang.  One might even do the same for former Prime Minister Menachim Begin, who was a former leader of the Irgun.  But Netanyahu?  Once again, this is poor journalism.  And by the way, you might want to see how often the author calls any Arabs \"extremists.\"    It is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the Arab world has reminded many Israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in Germany in the 1930s.  And that has resulted in some analogies being made between Arab antisemitism today and German antisemitism before and during World War Two.  Huband makes fun of such analogies.  I think he should have taken them seriously.  More bad journalism.    The author does take Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi seriously, though.  Huband quotes him to explain that the Arabs are \"innocent bystanders,\" and that the Jews are visiting revenge on the Arabs for European antisemitism!  This is total nonsense, of course.  More bad journalism.      Now, does a \"one-state\" solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict make sense?  Maybe so.  Israel exists in order to protect Jewish rights and to provide a refuge for Jews.  It exists to provide a state where Jews will speak Hebrew natively, attend Hebrew schools universities, have Hebrew traditions, and so forth.  It can do all that in a state which has a large non-Jewish population.  And Israel, even with ten thousand square miles, would be rather small for a state which houses over five million Jews.  If Jewish rights to life, liberty, property, and immigration are protected, a one-state solution may be best.  Besides, while many people say that another Arab state is needed as well, I see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy Israel.    The author agrees that a one-state solution is best.  And I think he even acknowledges that Israel is part of the Middle East.  But it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish Jewish rights rather than support them.  And getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region.    This book is a good one to avoid",

            "input": "Every Bit as Good as Elegant Universe . I would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" is just a rehash of \"Elegant Universe\" with little more to offer, and in fact not as well written.  On the contrary, I found \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" to be equally as engaging as \"Elegant Universe\" and to offer a great deal of new material.  It is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books, but I for one preferred it that way.  I read \"Elegant Universe\" several years ago, and although I have a general feel for the concepts, I appreciated the refresher on many of the details.  By including the background material in \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" I never felt lost, and I never had to refer back to another book.  The background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books, but it is not identical, so I never felt like I was rereading the same old stuff.    Another minor issue I've seen some complain about is the use of The Simpson's (and other) television characters in his examples.  Personally I could care less what characters are used in the examples, but from a practical standpoint, I much preferred names like Marge and Lisa to names like Slim and Jim (which were used in \"Elegant Universe\").  I could easily keep track of what Marge and Lisa were doing in an example, whereas I was often confused about what Slim and Jim were doing.  The similar sounding names drove me crazy.  So from a practical standpoint, I preferred the names used in \"Fabric of the Cosmos\".    Now what about the content of the two books?  For me \"Elegant Universe\" was more of an introduction to string theory, whereas  \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" was much more an exposition on cosmology.  In \"Elegant Universe\" roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics, and then the remainder of the book, some 250 pages, was about string theory.  In \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics, (about 120 pages) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of \"what is space\" and \"what is time\".  Then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe.  If you want an excellent description of inflation theory, Higgs fields, and the like, this is the source.  And then only in the last roughly 120 pages does Greene bring string theory into all of this, and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book.  Bottom line is \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that I did not get from \"Elegant Universe\".  Both books are outstanding, and I would certainly recommend both.  The point being simply that these are different books, and \"Fabric of the Cosmos\" is not just a rehash of \"Elegant Universe\".    Finally, as in \"Elegant Universe\", Greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next.  I've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived.  In Greene's book this is never an issue.  Sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense, but I would much prefer a book that I can logically work my way through, albeit sometimes with a bit of patience, than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve.  Don't get me wrong though, even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense, I never found it to be dry.  Greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout.    Very highly recommended",

There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with \"the other Charlie\".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.

As some readers have complained, this is not really a \"Christian\" book because the focus isn't on Christ, it's on YOU.      A Biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally, the way Jesus would, and not on trying to \"find the perfect spouse.\"  The whole premise of the book is rather un-Christlike:  making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you.  It's rather selfish, really, when you consider the words of John the Baptist: \"Christ must become more, I must become less,\" as well as the warning in Song of Solomon \"Do not awaken love until it so desires.\"      Shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify Christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires?  Finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines.  Hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic, Christlike love must take precedence.  I don't mean to sound accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls \"seduction.\"    My brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a \"poser.\" This happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex.  You have to ask:  What kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are?  I personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality.    It is a combination of both action and faith that is important.

Then, he suggests we put \"first things first.\" I believe that most parents would admit that they do wish to have \"FAMILY\" comes first--above all else. But, in today's busy, often stressful daily routine of life, accomplishing that goal is often \"easier said than done\". Covey clearly points out the essentials...such as establishing effective communication lines through family meetings and one-on-one talks with the kids. He makes so much sense as he describes with personal anecdotes how love, values, morality, and empathy for others is a process of teaching and learning from \"the inside out\"...in other words from within the family rippling out to society at large. He talks about establishing a family mission statement and helps to direct moms and dads to find the courage and the skills to make changes for the better. Covey's book creates the mindset and the outline. If you have young kids like me, I recommend a perfect compliment 'how-to book' with Covey's ... called \"THE POCKET PARENT.\" This handy book, written for parents of 2-6 year olds, is loaded with compassion and humor along with over one thousand tips and skills to try. It literally trouble-shoots many of the problem behaviors we all deal with daily-such as Angry outbursts, Bedtime, Mealtime and Clean-up refusals, Tantrums, Disrespectful attitude, the \"Gimmes\", Morning \"Crazies\", Sibling fights, Whining and many more. These 2 books (one more theoretical, the other more \"hands on\" practical) have changed our lives.

Mention the word \"sadism\" and the results it produces will vary from an embarrassed Victorian blush to righteous indignation that such things should exist at all, not to mention it being a topic for discussion among proper and civilized human beings.  Yet to Thomas Moore, a former monk and Jungian analyst and writer, it is precisely this topic that needs to be explored mentally, even spiritually, in order to prevent it from erupting into anti-social, or even criminal acts in the flesh.      Examining the writings of the infamous Marquis de Sade, Moore delves into the healing role of de Sade that digs deeper than the surface appearance of de Sade as pornographer to find value in what is cursorily dismissed as naught but tasteless perversion.  According to Moore's analysis of de Sade's writing, the virgin needs the libertine to complement her chastity, as much as he needs her pristine purity to define who he is.      Yet, a deeper understanding of Moore's treatise on de Sade reveals that wholeness is the object of the soul's journey, and that experiencing the self as holy--at the expense of being whole-- unjustly deprives the psyche of its completion.  He believes that every human being should be in touch with his Sadean side-- at least mentally-- for human potential not explored is what cripples the soul.  Just as there is no stick that has but one end, human potential and creativity must at least acknowledge, without necessarily favoring, the dark side of the psyche so that it's full complexity can be known and appreciated.  For Moore, as well as for de Sade, the perverse side of the personna that is forbidden to manifest itself mentally becomes the powerful driving force for enactment in the psycho-socially mal-adjusted person.    It is perhaps society's denial of our own dark eros that enrages and offends most when we see it demonstrated in others, for that denial surely perverts any attempt at self-knowledge, and forces the soul to assume a posture of balance and completeness that is false,lame, and ultimately unhealthy.  Moore hints that without personal aknowledgment of the darker depths of our psyches, as de Sade so blatantly illuminates, we cannot hope to soar to our greatest heights, for what we resist persists, and the chains of denial keep us tethered to terra firma instead of flying the limitless skies of our Divinity.    This book is not a quick read, nor is it for the judgmental or faint of heart.  It requires time, and a certain willingness examine our own depths, not favoring the dark, forbidden aspects of our psyche, but rather  admitting that a Sadean dark eros lies hale and hearty within us all, waiting to be revealed to honest introspection for spiritual growth through courage of heart.",

It is a very carefully crafted product with the primary purpose of continuing Microsoft's continued dominance of the desktop marketplace, and a part of Microsoft's thrust to move more heavily into the server marketplace.      As best I can tell, it works something like this. Microsoft recognizes that servers handling up web pages, processing mail, etc. are a huge market, but that Linnux owns a big percentage of that market. Consequently Microsoft came up with the .NET strategy. .NET is a bunch of subroutines (if you will) that are written to provides all kinds of utility to programmers. You write your applications using propriatary programming languages such as C# and J# that use the .NET library and consequently have to run on Microsoft operating systems.     In the Office environment, packages such as OpenOffice have gotten to be pretty good, are basically Microsoft compatible so you don't have a re-training problem, and are FREE. I don't know how much success OpenOffice has had, but it appears to be enough to attract Microsoft's attention.     Enter VSTO. VSTO adds customization and productivity to Microsoft Office applications through 'links' that tie Office to the .NET framework. So to use VSTO first you must have and load the .NET framework, then you must load Visual Studio.NET - in that order -- then install Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Office.     All of this is clearly explained by Mr. Bruney in this book, who then goes on to do an excellent job of explaing how to write programs using VSTO. As examples he includes some real world applications. Most of the book is on Excel applications, but Word and Outlook are included as well. Finally he concludes the book with an excellent discussion on pivot tables.     Conclusion: A well written, understandable and complete book on VSTO. If you're going to be using VSTO, this is an excellent place to start",

I bought this book a number of years ago for apologetics purposes-- While I would agree with other reviewers that it holds a high view of Scripture, and the book definitely represents a lot of research, I think that the approach to symbology used here can be problematic.  The entire book is a study of constellations,  and how they display the Gospel in the Stars. While this is an interesting study I think there a oouple of underlying problems with this approach.    1.  Constellations and star names are simply assignments that man has assigned to stars.  Usually pagan cultures in association with their pagan mythology.  Although this does not completely undermine such a study it does call it into question.  2.  A second more serious problem is the same problem which underlies numerology and other allegorical approaches-- they can often be made to say anything the author even while at the same time appearing scholarly.     Those looking for apologetics in the cosmos should consider investigating the \"anthropic principle\" which tracks evidence of God's design of the universe.

Hugh, drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency, is in love with his brother John's wife. John, a general in the army in France, does not make an appearance, but his sons Nick and David do. Nick is feckless and irresponsible, just one step ahead of being drummed out of the Royal Navy himself, while David is more professional if somewhat dull. That in the course of the book, one's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character's past layer by layer, like peeling an onion.    The criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing. Yes, the book is choppy and yes, it is hard to follow the course of the action. One's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix, but then you realize that this is the whole point. Fullerton's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the Battle of Jutland felt to those who were there. Jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events. Fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time. But you can't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative, just as even Lord Jellicoe wasn't able to do so. For that, you need to consult another book (I would recommend Rules of the Game by Andrew Gordon, which is not only the finest description of the battle, but one of the finest works of military history), but do it after you read this book, so that you get the full flavor of the writer's intent.     Very few writers capture the fog of war as well as Fullerton does",

In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more",

Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have \"briefed\" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.    It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the \"testimony\" is second-hand).     The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that \"Disclosure\" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even \"written\" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.     The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.    In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.    Tragically disorganized efforts like \"Disclosure\" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but \"Disclosure,\" for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.",

Zahn is an excellent storyteller, but honestly, he isn't a very good writer. The trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies. \"Luke reaches for his lightsaber, and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on Hoth and had to use the Force to get his lightsaber from the snow.\" It's not necessary, and I groaned every time Zahn did it. James Luceno knows how to make appropriate and timely references. Zahn fails.    I personally liked the specific technical jargon, but I'm surprised that most other people did, too.     The story, though, what can I say? It's a good story. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the most awesome person I know. It was genuinely hard to be happy seeing the empire defeated this time around. I hated C'Boath, but then again, you'te supposed to.  The noghri are a fascinating creation and their story is followed all the way through.     Everyone we know from the movies are there with a role, and act appropriately, although you never get the feeling that you've learned anything more about any existing character. New characters, like Mara Jade and Talon Kaarde, are superb additions to the saga. Creating characters really is Zahn's strongest point, I feel.     The books fall victim of being written before the prequels, and being early EU novels in general but that is no one's fault, and the \"errors\" are reconciled easily enough.    As a trilogy, it is consistent and drives towards a consistent goal throughout.     One other thing about the story, and I think this is why so many people adore these books more than I think they deserve, is that it is epic. I have yet to read another Star Wars book or series that approaches the expanse and import of this trilogy. It really concerns a huge part of the Star Wars timeline, and as a story matches the significance of the movies themselves, unlike any other books. That doesn't make these books the best books, most interesting, or best written, but I think it is that epic feeling that makes this series so popular, despite being unspectacular in several ways.",

John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a \"rigorous classical education.\"   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.

            "input": "A brilliant conception of vampires which combines sci-fi and horror. Well written, atmospheric, intelligent. Highly recommended . Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.    This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about.    The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result.    Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text.    I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those",

The advice Rand gives writers in this transcription of a series of living room lectures is sound in places: anchor your abstractions in the concrete; remember that art is selectivity; show, don't tell; use actions to illuminate your character, etc, etc, etc. All good advice, to be sure, but to say that Rand is proposing anything new or different from what is taught in writing seminars across the country is a little disingenuous. Add to this her refusal to praise the work of any author besides herself and Victor Hugo, her casual dismissal of prominent writers without convincing evidence (and, even more interesting, the relative paucity of authors she even brings up) and a few didactic guidelines (her ban on profanity, slang, and references less than one century old), and there's rather too much extraneous stuff here to be worth the effort of wading in to try to get to the good bits.

THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a \"passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential.\"   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.        Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.    Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its \"leveling effects.\"      Here's the problem with her \"philosophy:\"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.       Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are \"deep.\"     In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today.",

And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him.     The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many \"z's\" and \"v's.\"    On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking.

First of all, according to our medical practice, this book gives some bad nurishment advice!  Milk (and milk products such as cream and half & half) are NOT a good food for many cats.  Their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows' milk.    Having said what was foremost on my mind, I am also very disappointed in the \"behavior\" advice from this author.  I found very little information on kittens.....and almost nothing useful (which is why I purchased this book in the first place!).    In fact, I absolutely disagree with Ms. Wilbourn's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home.  From the new kitten arriving via \"escort\" to you (as the responsible owner) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon, as your adult cat \"takes care of himself and his kitten\".  What dangerous nonsense this is!  Stop and think.....what a 10 lb. adult could do to a 2 lb. kitten, if so inclined?    Perhaps the cats in Manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized (as opposed to Ms. Wilbourn's coined word \"catsonality\") then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar?    For the record, I currently have a terrific 15 year old, as well as a very feisty 4 month old.  I should have seen warning signs when this 224 page (LARGE print book) began with a 19 page forward.

As someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs, I do not know which would be worse.     The author's insincerity is self-evident in every concept, and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering...his tone is always \"prescient\" and always patronizing. The pseudo-goth aspect to Kon's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides, any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting. His obsession with \"naughty\" alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad.     His spiritual perspective is the same: he plays with a safe \"bad boy\" boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the \"essentially I'm not so bad\" image. The impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this.    My one star I rate for \"Nocturnicon\" comes from the book cover, which is far better than the book deserves, and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer. I have seen much worse get into print, including with his own publishing house, Llewellyn Publications. However if I was a cynic about occult arts, I would use this book to demonstrate why. As a reader I get the feeling that Kon-stantinos feels the same. He's looking to sell a concept, any concept. Here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the Necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus 5.     It seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that \"little ****er\" (he mentions in the intro) in his head. Either that or his misleading of the (mainly young deluded goth) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity. Which makes him a true Kon-man.",

He made a lot of money too, but Mr. Schwartz loves the limelight and a good competition. The book starts in 1979, when Schwartz abandoned his 9-year career as a securities analyst to trade his own money on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and progresses through his tumultuous, exciting trading career until the mid-1990s.     Schwartz sometimes digresses to relate incidents of his childhood and youth, illustrating that he was always a gambler by nature, so \"Pit Bull\" has some qualities of an autobiography. Schwartz' story is peppered with trading advice, and many of its best moments are when he describes his experiences during specific market events, such as his losses when the market surged after the 1980 presidential election, the idiosyncrasies of trading on the Merc, and October 1987's Black Monday and its aftermath. Martin Schwartz has a big personality and a frank sense of humor that keep the reader entertained. It seems he was both a success and a failure, having succeeded in making himself quite wealthy but not always wealthy enough for his tastes. But he gives the impression that he enjoys trading immensely most of the time.    \"Pit Bull\" concludes with \"The Pit Bull's Guide to Successful Trading\" in 30 pages, for those seeking insight into Martin Schwartz' success on the markets. It's a pretty handy guide in which Schwartz lists the trading tools and market analysis services that he uses, outlines his techniques for using moving averages and some chart patterns, and summarizes how he plays stocks and futures. That's followed by a description of \"My Typical Day\". \"Pit Bull\" is fun, I instructional, and easy to read.  I was surprised that Mr. Schwartz sometimes tries to anticipate -or bet against- the market instead of following it. But sometimes he got burned. No surprise there",

If you're interested in reading biographies of scientists you've probably never heard of, this is definitely the book for you.    Why would I give a book I didn't finish 2 stars?  Because I did pick up a few interesting mathematical tidbits from the sections I read.  I just didn't pick up enough tidbits to keep me going.  The universal constant is interesting, and the cross section of the chaotic 3-D graph is interesting too.    Great for scientific history buffs, but those looking for application for personal use, forget it",

He is stuck in jail, having been caught thieving. He bragged about the theft, which is what got him caught.     He is taken from prison and told that the King wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth. Gen's only other option is death. So onward the journey goes. He travels with the Magus and his two apprentices, Ambiades and Sophos, plus the admirable soldier, Pol.    Gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft. This viewpoint lends a somewhat snide, yet funny and endearing perspective of the story. I enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout.    Plus, on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their Gods through campfire stories, which I found a wonderful addition to the story. They added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did.    I thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale. Yes, a worthy read indeed",

Two weeks ago my girlfriend Snow and I dined at Tetsuya's new restaurant Mju at the Millenium Knightsbridge Hotel in London, prompted by Snow's raving of Tetsuya from her winters in Sydney.  The only dining option is an eight-mini-course tasting menu, but since the man himself was in town (Tetsuya spends only one week a month in London) we were all for it.  We thought the portions were adequate, but I suspect people used to NYC portions might go home hungry.  I must say that his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients, and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items.  Although the presentation of the food was highly stylised - just look at the photos in the cookbook and they are similarly presented at your table - the cooking is unfussed and the philosophy predominantly reflected the Japanese appreciation for simplicity and French classical culinary techniques.  The result was that every dish managed to emphasize yet enhance the flavor of the main ingredient.  Compared to Nobu, Tetsuya is hardly fusion and very Asian at heart.  Most of the courses served at Mju are included in the cookbook, so we know that these recipes have been tried and tested.  What's most gratifying is the listing at the end of the book of food sources for Mju - London lags NYC in terms of high-end food stores such as Dean &amp; Deluca and Citarella, so the list is very useful, and it allows me to dream about learning to cook at the level of a master like Tetsuya",

This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).     He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.    The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)    On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.     What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.    So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.    My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal.

When the days begin to grow short, and the air gets a little thick and crisp, I like to pull this book out, and go for a lie in the hammock.  It has been a fall favorite, since my freshman year of college.  Though not entirely wholesome, this book is one of the most puritan of Stephen King's prolific library.  There are really no graphic sexual scenes, and the language is tame, in comparison to . . . say, The Stand.  But you don't care about that.  You want to know why I thought it was a heck of a good read.  King is fascinated by small towns.  I can say that with a good deal of authority, because two-thirds of what he writes about takes place in small, Maine towns.  It's not the four-way intersections, and the cowpoke attitude that seems to capture his interest, but the dynamics of the small town, itself.  There is a certain attitude, in a small town; kind of like high school cliques, but on a grander scheme.  A small town has its own atmosphere; its own incestuous existence.  Stephen King enjoys watching as relationships frazzle, and small towns are demolished, with the ghoulish glee of a small child knocking over sandcastles.  'Salem's Lot mixes stark dread with a Rockwellian nostalgia that oozes out of the pages.  The result is a horrifically delicious milkshake that covers some traditional vampire ground, but also manages to stay fresh and poignant.  If the cemetery scene (in which a father grieves for his dead son) doesn't give you goosebumps, you are truly a jaded individual.",

            "input": "Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star . This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.    Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: \"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!\" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your \"belief\" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 \"Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son.\" or 1st John 4:3 \"...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.\" Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: \"TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation.\" What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: \"For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.\" Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case \"t\"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. \"Tribulation\" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case \"t\" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. \"Rapture\" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight.      Re: J. Czecholinski  Wow, J Czecholinski's perverting of the Scripture is uncanny. Somehow, he has gotten this vision and received a new gospel along with Lahaye and Jenkins. Most of his words are empty, his verses taken out of context, the use of visions in Revelation taken literal, and his best response is this: \"This thought process has dominated rapture writings for the past 25 years.\" Wow, 25 years! Forgot about centuries of beliefs that the disciples have passed down and Jesus's own words and the Scriptures (again I point to the verses you brought up 1st Thessalonians 4:16-17 - LOUD COMMAND and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD!!!). And then he tries to debate the baptism issue which Jesus and the disciples have passed down, but in the last 100 years new thinkers have changed that to just \"pray Jesus into your heart\", although there are many verses about baptism being essential and ZERO about praying Jesus into your heart (Big one being said by Peter, a disciple of Jesus in Acts 2:38 \"Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\" Then there is: Matt 3:11, John 3 (water and Spirit!), Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12-16, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 9:18, Acts 19:3-5, Acts 22:16, ROMANS 6, 1 Corinthians 12:13, 1 Corinthians 15:29, Galatians 3:27, Ephesians 4:5, Colossians 2:12, and the list goes on and on although the Bible never says to pray him into your heart! I think the disciple Peter said it best in 1st Peter 3:18-22 \"For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It SAVES you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.\" Don't try to say that baptism is a good work and compare it to Ephesians 2:8 and take it out of context. Salvation requires: Believe, Confess, Repent, Baptism, and living by your faith. That is the belief that Jesus and the apostles have passed down for 2000 years. So J, you can go ahead and listen to thought of the last 25 to 100 years by man, but as for me, I will listen to the Scriptures and to Jesus and to Paul and the apostles. For Paul says in Galatians 1:12 \"I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.\" So there you go.",

My wife showed me this book one lazy Saturday afternoon in a local bookstore. \"I want you to look at this. It was such a good idea but he messed it up so badly.\"    This book should have developed real conjecture on the emotional lives of farm animals. It could have been a serious discussion of what we understand about animal emotions both positive and negative. It would have demonstrated how the natural farming movement has the potential to revolutionize animal husbandry and improve farm animal living conditions. Should have, could have, would have ... it didn't.    He apparantly intuits emotions from these creatures who at the very least do not speak his language and at the most are experiencing very different emotions than the ones he describes. Doubtless he is gifted with superhuman intuitive ability from his years of analytic training; us mere mortals would be unable to consistantly reproduce his observations.    (As a brief example look at the emphasis on eye expressions despite a lack of evidence for any real facial expression translatability across species lines. Urban readers cannot readily observe farm animals to verify this so I'd suggest a trip to the local zoo to test my counter assertion. There, the most casual observer can see that a broad, friendly human smile will send an entire cagefull of monkeys into conniptions. Why? Because many species of simians translate 'smile' as 'teeth-baring dominence display'.)    Nevertheless I rated this book 2 stars instead of one, as there were a few interesting anectdotes interspersed amongst the verbage.    (Edited to add a note about trembling cows.) Cows tremble when they are annoyed by flies. Having no hands their first line of defence is their tail, but flies often land on shoulders and other body parts out of its limited reach. They tremble, shaking their skin to dislodge the pests. They shake their heads, sometimes violently. Their eyes roll and they sometimes look like they're going to fall over. I suppose it is convenient for the writer of this book that flies congregate where cows are penned together but more so that people have forgotten the 2000 year old story of Io, Hera and Zeus.",

            "input": "\"A Visit in the Damp and Dark Will Serve Much Better than the Lark...\" . Donna Jo Napoli's trademark technique of fleshing out a fairytale is in fine display in \"The Magic Circle,\" her retelling of \"Hansel and Gretel\". Napoli's stories often reveal motivations behind some of the action that takes place in the traditional fairytales, reasoning out some of the fantastic elements and explaining the behaviour of the familiar characters; which usually results in the villain becoming more sympathetic and understandable. Such is certainly the case in \"The Magic Circle\", in which she explores the background of Hansel and Gretel's wicked witch.    The hunchback woman is known as the Ugly One by all her neighbours, but has the gift of healing which she uses to aid pregnant women and sick people in her medieval Europe community. She is the proud mother of a beautiful little girl called Asa, and enjoys her simple life as midwife in her country cottage. But her friend Bala has other ideas, getting her work with wealthy families and in researching demonic activity so that Ugly One may earn some more money - with much of the proceeds going to Bala of course.     Ugly One is unsure about extending her talents to exclude exorcisms, knowing the danger is extremely great, but as a devout Christian and a healer she feels compelled to comply with Bala's wishes - surely God will aid her, and no harm will come to her if she places herself within a magic circle that will protect her from the demons' tricks. After cleansing a little boy from a demon's influence, Ugly One knows that she has found her new calling in life.    But once several years pass, her confidence in her own abilities grow and in a mistake that will haunt her forever, she is careless with the protective magic circle. What follows is an escalating series of events that has her transformed into a witch by the vengeful demons and tied to a stake by the terrified villagers. Bartering with the demons for her daughter's life, Ugly One manages to use her newfound malevolent powers to escape and hide in the forest.    In Napoli's book the term `witch' is used in the traditional Christian sense, not the New Age one, so be prepared for a negative usage of the word (personally I found it quite refreshing this way - evil witches are so rare these days!) However, it's not so black and white, for though Ugly One can no longer shed tears, bleed or sleep, has demons whispering in her ears and an appetite for children, she is determined to not give in to her weaknesses. Living in isolation, she manages to keep the demons at bay - until she hears the voices of two lost children outside her home...    Napoli's story is poignant and thought-provoking, as she raises questions concerning the nature of evil, the will of God and the strength of the individual against temptation. Like all her other books, her spin on a traditional folktale is fascinating and will change your perception of \"Hansel and Gretel\" forever. Although her interpretation of the gingerbread house is a little weak and a revelation concerning Bala is raised only to be ignored, \"The Magic Circle\" is an intriguing little book. The demons and magical rituals mentioned are all based in real Biblical and Occult study (so you'll learn something practical alongside the retold fairytale!) and its length means you can probably finish it within a day. Though it is not my favourite Napoli novel (that would have to be \"Zel\" and \"Spinners\"), \"The Magic Circle\" is a great little read.",

            "input": "Dead stall... . Warning spoilers...    In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die.  Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely.  Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible.  I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures.  Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish.  While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab.  I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess.    Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot.  Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author.  What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters \"learn\" about them.  In other words she can \"feed the fire\" of the story well to keep interest.      But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail.    Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing.  This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush.  Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility.  This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction.  You know, an assassin.      This series asks people a simple question.  How would you describe an assassin?  Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous.  Crafty certainly.  After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs?  Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty?  So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin?  No, you can't do that.  An assassin is an assassin.  You can't change that FACT.  No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business.  As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves.  He never is actually put to any test.  So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer.  He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero.  When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero.  For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?).  [...]  Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama.  But of course, the main threat, the \"forged ones\" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end.  But I felt the whole story, the drama of the \"forged ones\" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did.  On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting.  Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid.  And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all.  Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown.    If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again.  I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff.  But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series.    Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure",

It's an unconventional book that doesn't mince words...    Contents:  Pool Hall Wisdom; Brand Misinformation versus Back-End Thinking; The Common Thread and Thinking Two Products Ahead; Branding?

In other words, you need to be thinking about the overall story and impression that your company and product leaves with a customer.  This collection of legends and perceptions defines your brand, not the cute logo or corporate colors you stick on your products.  What that means is that you *have* a brand whether you think you do or not.  You need to bring your customer into the \"marketing funnel\", which is a four stage process: intrigue, consider, interested, and buy.  When you get them to buy, then the \"two products ahead\" mindset turns them from one-off buyers to loyal customers.  It's all a matter of managing your brand...  the story that your customers tell about your company and product.    This book started off as an e-book that the author marketed himself (for a much higher price).  His style of writing and communication is frank and blunt, with no room for dancing around an issue.  As such, it's a lot of fun to read.  Since I don't have a marketing background, I found it a little difficult to keep the finer points of marketing vs. branding vs. selling straight at times.  But overall, I got the message that your brand is a priceless asset, and it's important to do everything you can to make sure that brand says the right thing to your customer.    A valuable read for any business, but especially for the small business owner who doesn't think he has a brand...  he does.",

From that initial list, he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter.  These mindsets, if understood, directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings.  For instance, it's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything.  But in reality, the same underlying forces continue to drive people's lives.  Business is in a constant state of flux, but it still ends up being all about buying and selling.  In sports, the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in 1936, but the game itself was still the same...  score a basket.  Once you strip away the fluff and hype, it's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going.  Or my favorite...  don't add something unless you subtract something.  Setting a cap on a situation (be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant) forces you to weigh the merits of each item, keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others.  Something to remember before you make yet another commitment...    Part 2 of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations.  Personally, I found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first.  While I understand that the visual is becoming more important in today's society, I had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going.  He does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws, but I found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life.    Definitely worth reading, even if you don't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out.  I'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain.  And don't be surprised if I turn down some \"adds\" because I'm not ready to \"subtract\" something..",

            "input": "Very Good Collection of Comfort Restaurant Food . `The Foster's Market Cookbook' by Sara Foster, with Sarah Belk King, I bought in my `buy everything I saw on the Food Network' phase, especially after I saw Sarah Foster demonstrate her killer sticky bun recipe on the Food Network's `In Martha's Kitchen' show. This was also in my sticky bun-baking period, before I gave it up as too much work and went back to straight breads.    One of the main reasons the book sat unopened on my shelves for so long was the fact that the `killer sticky bun' recipe was simply not that killer. Do not believe anyone when they say they have an easy sticky bun recipe, because it probably means the end result will fall below expectations. Around the same time, I did a sticky bun recipe from funny baker Wayne Harley Brachman, and that one didn't come up to snuff anyway. Leave it to Julia Child to come through for me. I did the sticky bun recipe in `Baking with Julia' and it was a LOT of work, but it in fact surpassed anything you can get from the mall.    But getting back to Sarah Foster's book, I have come back to it because I harbored s suspicion that there was some really good stuff in the book, and I was not disappointed.    Part of my attraction is that I am a sucker for any cookbook that covers sandwiches. While I think Foster's sandwich recipes are not as interesting or as complete as those in Nancy Silverton's whole book devoted to the subject, they are a great resource if you happen to have no other source of ideas for sandwiches.    Otherwise, the book covers everything you would expect, and it is especially strong on topics where you would expect expertise such as muffins, biscuits, scones, soups, salads, and egg dishes. On one of my favorite criteria for evaluating cookbooks, the recipe for a classic French omelet, Foster comes through like a champ. The only omelet tip she does not follow is to let the eggs come to room temperature before cracking and beating them, but then, this is probably quite impractical for a restaurant kitchen.    She is also quite good on another of my favorite criteria, the making of stocks. Her recipes are very good for non-foodies and people who care not for haute cuisine, as they do not take very long to produce a very acceptable chicken, vegetable, or beef stock. My only reservations may be that some of her suggestions may lead to waste perfectly good poached chicken on the one hand and include less than edible vegetable cuttings into stocks. There is a reason some people are hyperfussy about stock making. These are but two of the reasons.    I fully endorse Ms. Foster's recipes for muffins, biscuits, and scones. They are as good or better than recipes I have seen in books by professional bakers and books specializing in these subjects.    The hardest aspect of whether it is worth buying this book is how if will complement your current cookbook collection. If you are a cookbook collector, the question is moot. Nothing will stop you from getting this notable title. On the other hand, if all you have is `The Joy of Cooking', this would be a welcome supplement, as like fellow Martha Stewart alumnae, Ina Garten's early cookbooks, all the recipes come from a commercial kitchen which depends on their products for good business and the products are relatively easy to make.    This also means that the selection of recipes is very good fare for church bazaars and bake sales. While Foster is downsizing her recipes to household serving numbers, I am sure that her soups would work well at two to four to eight times her recipe size. Just be a little careful on multiplying some of the spicier ingredients.    I find all the recipes extremely well written. They are full of important details for amateur chefs and unlike some books, everything is printed in good old fashioned black and white with a little highlight shading here and there for sidebars. And, several dishes are presented in living color photographs, and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of Foster's Market staff and customers. My only argument with the layout of the book is the chapter title pages where the names of the recipes are written in a kind of multicolored hodgepodge, similar to the maddening typography in Jamie Oliver's otherwise excellent cookbooks.    Fostering this kind of material is what made Martha Stewart so respectable in what she did on her shows. Of this genre of cookbook, this is a very good sample. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for recipes from this `feel good market' venue. I think, for example, that it is more value for the money than Ina Garten's first cookbook.",

When a pair of writers with special skills in the social science of espionage put their heads together, you can hear the resulting &quot;click&quot; in the pages of this very special book. Espionage, after all, is the art of the possible. A knows something and B wants to find out A) what A knows and B) how he knows what it is. It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.      And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so. Intelligence has changed rapidly in the years since the Cold War ended, and there are some satisfying books you could follow up on for post-graduate work, but SILENT WARFARE is a savvy place to begin",

The suburban landscape of the United States is the subject of this book, advertised as \"the first practical guide to creating communities that truly are communities-not merely enclaves near off-ramps.\" Guided by the principles of the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU), the book uses excerpts from that organization's Charter to illuminate its advocacy of more connected development patterns. The book's scope extends beyond the commercial strip to include the major building blocks of towns and suburbs, such as apartment complexes, schools, parks and office campuses.    Hall and Porterfield includes passages of fist-thumping suburbia-bashing similar to James Howard Kunstler's Home From Nowhere (1998, Touchstone Books) or Jane Holtz Kay's Asphalt Nation (1997, Crown). They also include graphic material, much of it adapted their earlier book, A Concise Guide to Community Planning (1994, McGraw-Hill).     Readers knowledgeable about New Urbanism will find few surprises here, other than a few glaring factual errors, like a reference to \"Tyson's Corners, Virginia, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States\" (p. 7) and a claim that Edge Cities and urban villages are \"two names for essentially the same thing\" (p. 210). Good points crop up here and there, but recommendations are so limited in scope that it can be difficult to discern whether the sample site designs are intended to be good or bad examples, which limits the book's usefulness pedagogically. The lack of dimensions on most of the drawings also severely limits the book's utility as a practical reference. Hall and Porterfield contrast \"conventional suburban development\" and \"Traditional Neighborhood Development\" options for site plans, but the comparisons sometimes seem forced and nearly always ignore the larger regional issues so critical to the debate.     One ideal audience for this book might suburban planning commissioners, who need guidance from designers in order to understand the differences between conventional suburban development pods and walkable, human-scaled neighborhoods.",

Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the \"remarkable coincidence\" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.    Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.    This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.    What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.    It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.

Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.   In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book.  Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through.

For fans of the Forgotten Realms, this book follows up on the events of the six book series War of the Spider Queen. So, before I start this review, if you have yet to read the War of the Spider Queen series, I strongly suggest you do before you read this as events from that series are talked about, and have consequences, in this book. If you choose to read this book, and most likely this trilogy, without reading WotSQ then there may be some things that just don't make sense - So consider yourself warned.    The plot of this book is not your traditional plot, in that it is not really one linear plot with a few sub-plots sprinkled in. The sub-plots are very good and hint at much larger ramification that will more than likely transpire in the next two books. There is the sub-plot of what really happened to Hallisstra Melarn at the end of the sixth WotSQ book, and how she became what she is now. There is a sub-plot of the followers of Eilstraee fighting followers of tow other entities. There is also a sub-plot of a larger `battle' between Lolth and Eilstraee. Ms. Smedman does a wonderful to weave all these sub-plots together to create not only an engaging story, but a seamless one at that. When the sub-plots shift between one another there is not much transition that throws the pace of the book off at all. The overall plot is very well written and easy to follow.    There are several characters in this book. This is both a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. With all the different sub-plots there needed to be many characters to keep everything going. However, with this amount of characters there is less time for them to be developed fully so the reader has a better connection with them. There are a few characters that I would have definitely liked to read more about, and maybe that will be remedied in the next two books. Don't get me wrong, there was some character development in this book, such as that of Hallisstra, her brother Q'arlynd both had significant development. Yet, the majority of the characters had little development. I believe that was just a part that had to suffer due to how much the plots of this book needed to be explained.    Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. This is not your traditional Drow novel in that it's not strictly about subterfuge and chaos. The pace of this book is very good and Ms. Smedman's writing lends itself to be easily read. It's very easy to read through one hundred pages and wonder where the time went. With some Drow books, the authors try to make these huge grand flourishes of prose, yet in this book Ms. Smedman seems conserved and this creates an easy feel.    If you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms and have read the WotSQ series you will undoubtedly enjoy this book for the continuation of that storyline. If you are a fan of fantasy in general and know a little about the Forgotten Realms I still believe you will enjoy this novel, although some things may not make much sense to you. At any rate, if you are considering reading this, I have no qualms about recommending it. It's a very nice addition to the Forgotten Realms universe.",

If you play chess with any seriousness, this book is certainly an educational tool in terms of understanding how the big organizations like FIDE and USCF operate. However, this book is very suitable for non-chessplayers as well in that there is no actual chess positions or analysis.

Though this is a long read (not to be undertaken in one sitting---at least by those without some background in the region/culture) it is well worth it should you wish to cultivate an understanding of Russia & Eastern Europe.  The novel is very true to historical detail, and although many of its characters are of course fictionalized, Rutherford has clearly gone to painstaking lengths to remain historically correct---far moreso than most \"historical\" novels.  Reading \"Russka\" will leave you with a true sense of a people and how they have evolved historically & culturally over the span of centuries.  I am a professor & I used this book with one of my classes as assigned reading, with sections of \"Russka\" paired with corresponding sections of a Russian history book with truly wonderful results---rather than griping about the reading load as usual, most students loved the book and via the novel & the pairing with the text, they seemed to learn a great deal.    Addendum (Feb 16).  Those folks who have criticised the book should perhaps view the book in the right light.  It is not intended to be nor should it be used as a text book or scholarly treatise---though it would be a wonderful and creative suppliment for the latter.

The plot goes that an  ancient (and missing) Vulcan gem, the largest in existence, has been found  on a primitive planet which the Enterprise happens to be visiting. After  retrieving it, however, mysterious murders start to happen on the  Enterprise, while Pike, on the planet's surface, becomes embroiled in a  missing person hunt for two young lovers who could have been kidnapped by  mutants.

            "input": "Underworld . Underworld is an ambitious book.   By examining politics, economics, and popular culture in the United States during the last half of the twentieth century, author Don DeLillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice.  In the world that he depicts, people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate.  In his opening scene, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game, where a young man senses \"the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations, the unseen something that haunts the day.\"  In other passages of the book, these connections take the form of history or a system: \"that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you.\"    The book focuses on Nick Shay, a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the Bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant.  It takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation, and this results in a pretty long book: 827 pages in the hard cover edition.  DeLillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in Nick's personal transformation, so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry, environmental degradation, and J. Edgar Hoover.      The connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious, and I would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm.  Also, DeLillo's dialogue has a definite style:  his characters seem to hoard their words, and an awful lot of them don't finish their sentences.  Whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader's tastes.  For me, this is a much better book than DeLillo's White Noise and Libra, which have been widely praised.",

            "input": "A Delight . The names Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner don't resonate as much as they used to.  As the decades go by even the old-timers among us haven't been around long enough to remember them.  They've pretty much become historical, iconic figures, like the stoic-looking George Washington on a dollar bill.  It's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time, but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive.      The author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that Ty Cobb had died.  Realizing that many of Cobb's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate, he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record--literally with a tape recorder--their stories for posterity.  Twenty six of them are recounted here.  Some of these guys are hall-of-famers, some of them not even close, but all of them--every single one--had a load of interesting tidbits to share.  Baseball was a different game back then.  America was a different place.      The first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers.  One of the fellows, for example, playing Detroit, talked about being a little nervous about Cobb, whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes.  A Detroit player, however, mentioned that Cobb never sharpened his spikes.  Not that they didn't discourage the other team from thinking so.        Walter Johnson had an arm like a bullwhip, but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of Sam Crawford.  Late in the game, if his team was ahead by enough runs, he'd toss a meatball in to Crawford and let him belt it.  He never did that for Cobb, though, who he hated.  Cobb could never figure out why Crawford was able to hit him.      Honus Wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them, with great quickness, great hitting and great fielding.  A couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up.  Tommy Leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman, shortstop, first-baseman and outfielder in the league--he played all of them--and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you couldn't really argue that he wasn't the best hitter in the league, either.      For some odd reason, there aren't that many memorable gems about the great Babe Ruth, although there are at least a few.  Harry Hooper (a guy I'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer) remembers Ruth in the first year he came up with Boston as a, \"big, overgrown, green pea.\"  \"Nineteen years old, poorly educated, only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization, he was gradually transformed into the idol of American youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . If somebody had predicted that back on the Boston Red Sox in 1914, he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum.\"    Along with these detailed sketches, including a ton of characters I haven't even mentioned--Germany Schaeffer, Rube Waddell (who didn't like to wear underwear), Lefty O'Doul, Dazzy Vance--the book is also, naturally, loaded with baseball anecdotes.  Some of the more famous plays of the time, for example, are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions.      Take the \"Bonehead\" Merkle play.  For those of you who don't know, what happened was this.  The Giants were tied with the Cubs for first place with one week to go in the season.  In a game against each other, in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game, the Giants had men on first and third with two outs.  Merkle was on first.  Birdwell hit a single to center, McCormack scored from third, and Merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse.  Without touching second.  The Cubs retrieved the ball from center field, Evers tagged second, and the run didn't count.  Because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date.  The Giants lost it, and lost the pennant.  From then on and forever more, Fred Merkle became \"Bonehead\" Merkle.        But it's actually a little more complicated than that.  For one thing, Merkle was only nineteen.  It was the first game he'd ever started for the Giants.  And running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did--whether touching second was necessary or not--because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game.  The players ran off to get away from them.  And Evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands.  Fred Snodgrass doesn't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all.  The umpires weren't around to know this, though;  they had already left the field!  Funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things.  The detail in this book brings these stories back to life.  And there are a ton of them recounted.      Along with all of this baseball lore, you get a pretty good glimpse of America a hundred years ago, too.  People were more humble, but in general confident, and much more direct.  It's fascinating just to consider their nicknames:  \"Wee Willie\" was the nickname for a short guy, \"Specs\" was the guy who wore glasses, \"Chief,\" (at least two of them) were American Indians, and, \"Dummy\" was the guy who was deaf and dumb.  Nobody meant anything by it;  nobody apparently took offense.  Stuff like these speaks volumes.          Here's Jimmy Austin:  \" . . . they didn't have clubhouses in most parks, especially not for the visiting team.  We'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses.  They used to call it a tally-ho in those days.  We'd sit on seats along the sides and ride, in uniform, to the ballpark and back.    \"That ride was always a lot of fun.  Kids running alongside as we went past, and rotten tomatoes once in a while.  Always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by, you know.\"      Yep.  Thanks in part to this book, we know all right.",

            "input": "Not a GOOD detective! . Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.    Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.    It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.    Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment",

As I sit here thinking about the experience of reading the book, and it is an experience I assure you,   I can tell you that there are slow periods in this \"story\" when you hope it will be \"over soon\".  So, don't expect an \"easy read\" on this one.  But the main idea is so \"universal\" and the story in its totality is so well written, that you forgive any \"lapses into boredom\" of the narrative.  In fact, that's partially what the book is about:  \"small town boredom\" of an intelligent and thoughtful and self examining lady in the early part of the 20th century. And, further, it's about the \"will to overcome\" and the  \"courage to overcome\" this boredom and pettiness of the small town by the main character who is a \"downtrodden female\" of that era.  I think this could be considered a \"woman's lib\" book.  As you read you will \"cheer on\" the main character, Carol, as she faces down the town pettitness and town bullies and even her somewhat staid but basically \"good guy\" husband.    The main thing that is bugging Carol is this:  She \"hasn't found her true life's occupation\" and she feels \"trapped\" in the little podunk town of Gopher Prairie and in her marriage so that she'll never \"find her true self\". (wow, what a name for a town!o)   This theme is a universal theme because everyone, even men, have the same driving force of finding \"who am I\" and \"where do I really belong.\"   It's a \"universal theme\".  Thus this is an \"important book\" to read if you have ever had similer thoughts and restiveness about \"where do I belong\" and \"what is my true purpose in life.\"   Just keep reading past the \"slow parts\" and you'll find that your effort will be rewarded.

Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????     HUH?

Are they primarily preachers, Chief Executive Officers, ones who empower the laity, counsellors in the clinical vane or spiritual directors in the Catholic tradition? Drawing from a deep well of theological and historical insight, as well as years of pastoral experience, Willimon tackles these and other questions arranged in thirteen well-crafted chapters covering the full spectrum of pastoral theology.  Pastor balances theory and practice, and is full of real-life examples from Willimon's own experience. One example is the way he comes against the individualist spirit of North American Christianity, and calls for pastors to see themselves as participants with all of God's people in transformative communities of faith and not merely as religious managers.

            "input": "You would think our own would know the score. . No one with a true understanding of Billie Holiday would consider her a Blues Singer.  As such to truly study Blues Legacies, it would be better if a Blues singer like Memphis Minnie, one of the greatest female instrumental blues singers, were included. Surely, Dinah Washington, justifiably named the Queen of the Blues, or Ruth Brown, (Miss or maybe now Ms Rhythm) would be more appropriate to a study of Black blues women.      This hints that the generalizations in this book may be the result of pushing around reality rather than studying it. This is an all too frequent problem in the writing of academics who seem more concerned about creating their own little niche of analysis, than situating their work in the realities of life, culture, and art where the blues or Jazz, and Billie's real life live.        Billie did not like to be called a Blues Singer.  If we are concerned with the voices of Black women, then someone involved in this book should have at least had the respect to listen to Billie Holiday's voice on the matter.  She considered herself a Jazz singer and later a cabaret singer.      She recorded very few blues.  The two blues she recorded again and again \"Billie's Blues\" and \"Fine and Mellow\" were only recorded because in two different recording sessions there was time to record additional songs, but no preparation or charts existed for any song, so an easy to play blues was selected. Billie recorded them and performed these two tunes often because she had the author's credit and publishing on them which made it easier and more profitable. This is despite the fact that the exact word sets had been sung and recorded by real blues singers before Billie had the brains to record AND copyright them.  Listen to Helen Humes sing an exact version of Fine and Mellow with another name during the first Spirituals to Swing concert that took place BEFORE Billie recorded her version.             A good contrast with Billie, though male, was her friend and often colleague Jimmie Rushing who served with her in the Basie Band. Despite his penchant for claiming he was a ballad singer as well--Rushing actually thought that when Billie left Basie that rather than hiring another singer, he alone could fill the gap--Rushing's recordings with Walter Page's Blue Devils in the 1920s, with Moten in the early 1930s, and with Basie in the 1930s and 1940s are masterpieces of the blues. Many of his renditions like Good Morning Blues have become standards for blusicians of all stripes.  Lesser known but deserving more attention are his great blues recorded with KC musicians for John Hammond on Vanguard in the 1960s.      Otherwise she recorded few blues, particularly in her most artistically developed period between 1934 and 1945. Indeed,  Billie's lack of a blues repertoire and disinclination to perform blues cost her her position as female vocalist with the Count Basie Orchestra, a match made in heaven. While there were no doubt other factors involved, many Basieites especially Buck Clayton who was quite close to Billy have said Billie was replaced because she didn't perform enough blues to suit John Hammond who acted as de facto manager and AR man with the Basie band.  Hammond replaced Billie Holiday with Helen Humes who had been recording blues for ten years before she joined Basie.  Humes, of course, continued to record Blues with Basie, and then as an independent singer from  then until her death keeping her magnificent jump blues alive for several generations of listeners.  Clayton's complaint is a standard one leveled at white Jazz producers like Hammond and Norman Grantz that they wanted blues, not more harmonically developed music that Black Jazz musicians really wanted to play.          The blues is a specific genre of African American musical, poetic, and cultural expression with its own distinct history, evolution, and practices.  Simply collapsing every  Black performer into the Blues makes the blues meaningless and demeans the work of the millions of women and men who have created the blues in the last 110-120 years.          Another insult to Billie, is the tendency to see her as a \"blues figure\" because of her \"tragic\" life.  This is the tendency to evaluate Billie as the public life disaster that she tended to milk in desperation in the last years of her life symbolized by the fake autobiography _Lady Sings the Blues_.  This contrasts than the artistic consideration she deserved and received from other musicians and singers.  She was a competent and practicing jazz artist, raised in the music business (her father complained he played guitar for every jazz artist in NYC in the 1930s and early 1940s but Billie.  Her mother boarded musicians and catered musical parties). From a young age, Billie was considered as knowledgeable as the top instrumentalists of the music by those top instrumentalists.    Those who rely on the \"tragedy\" to induct Billie into the Blues express a greater ignorance given that as her own drug addiction advanced, her music had less and less of a connection with the blues, climaxing in \"The Lady in Satin\" which is a vain attempt to take The Lady into non-Jazz pop. All of her original blues were recorded in her pre-heroin youth in the 1930s, not in the 1950s when Billie's self-made \"tragedy\" had begun to destroy her voice and musicial viability and then her life.     It is quite bizarre for anyone to claim Billie's performance of Meeropol's song \"Strange Fruit,\" has any relationship to blues music given her very straight reading of the tune, the unblueslike straight minor it is given, and the unjazzlike accompaniment. If one wants to see what a Blues Singer can do to this song, one needs to listen to the astounding version recorded by Josh White which is blusey and also more dramatic and satisfying than Holiday's more celebrated version.  Holiday's performance of \"Strange Fruit,\" tends to be elevated by folks for the justifiable political message the song provided and the controversy involved.  However, an honest or even rational evaluation of the performance seems to be unavailable these days.    This raises yet another ignorance, the outsider's view that \"The Blues\" is always sad or \"tragic.\"  The immense body of the most popular blusicians--that is blues artists that Black people listened to-- of the 1930s like Memphis Minnie, Tampa Red, and Leroy Carr served up a bunch of pretty happy, often double entendre, blues. Blues music was overwhelmingly dance music, with performers not playing the three minute blues contemporary white blues wannabe's deduce from recordings, but 10 to even 30 minute versions of their songs for dancers from Juke Joints to the big ballrooms. Unfortunately, people who have never studied the blues as a real genre, misplace it as the solo moaning of the \"existential Negro,\" rather than the jumping music of a century of African American Saturday nights.                    As an African American performer of the blues and other Black traditional musics as well as a scholar of African American music tradition, this kind of non scientific, non-traditional, grab bag sloppiness about our music and our culture is a sign that even among our own, the outsider's false generalizations about the blues reign.  You would think our own would know the score.",

Moreover, Ms. Tyler, like Hardy and Miller before her, clearly believes and successfully posits that her mundane characters are heroic because they survive, perservere and present (albeit unknowingly) moral and spiritual lessons that are universal to us all. But my hesitation in giving this novel 5 stars is that, while it is great fiction, it is not the greatest fiction of its time. And this raises another issue.  Why have so many Pulitzer Prize novels, such as \"Gilead,\" \"The Known World,\" \"Empire Falls,\" \"The Hours,\" \"Kavalier & Clay,\" and \"Middlesex,\" disappointed me recently? While these are compelling and at times superb works, they are not, in my opinion, deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  Of recent winners, only \"The Shipping News\" merits that distinction.

Described as a 'phallic' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility,' and as a, 'Solar emblem of the 'sky gods,' and later as an, 'emblem of Saint John the Babtist,' this is clearly a female iconic Goddess figure holding a double-sided LABRYS (axe) in each upraised arm.

            "input": "Disingenuous Argument . Larry Arnhart is a serious, perceptive ethical philosopher whose works deserve praise (and to be read), but this book is a failure. The arguments are weak and will certainly fail to convince most \"conservatives\" to embrace Darwinian evolutionary theory.    Evolutionary biology is scientifically correct, which is the main reason it must be accepted by anyone, whatever their political philosophy (Arnhart does not stress this). However, Darwinian biology can be either used or ignored in making political arguments, so I will rephrase the issue as: are there good arguments flowing from evolutionary biology for conservative political philosophy?    We must note that at least in the USA, there are two quite different branches of conservativism, one espousing religious fundamentalism and the other classical economic liberalism. They have almost nothing in common intellectually and are simply politically linked by historical events. Arnhart does not stress this point.    Arnhart's arguments directed towards religious conservatism can be summarized as: (a) evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God; (b) evolutionary biology recognizes and reinforces the notion that religious belief is a universal element of human nature; and (c) a strong adherence to family values is part of human nature. I agree with these statements, but Arnhart never addresses the burning issues, which include abortion, homosexuality, gay marriage, and state-religion separation. He does deal with intelligent design, which he rejects as a scientific theory. This is in part why I call his book \"disingenuous:\" he simply avoids the hard topics.    Turning to classical liberalism, Arnhart says that Darwinian evolution supports a Burkean political philosophy. I think this is a plausible argument, although Arnhart avoids all the hard questions by choosing as the alternative political philosophy an absurd caricature of the leftist alternative that is more or less 19th century Utopianism. Societies grow organically, Arnhart says, and cannot be socially engineered using the principles of Reason alone. Of course this is correct, but this is accepted by all relevant political philosophers today (except Peter Singer and his bizarre ilk). What about the proper extent of government, the treatment of poverty, the environment, and foreign relations? Nothing here.     I am not a conservative, and I don't think much of conservative political philosophy, but if I were, I would not be moved by Arnhart's arguments (I am also not a liberal, by the way, and in fact I think the liberal/conservative dichotomy is a sick joke, but that's a topic for another day...)",

For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin.  The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them.  How did Coren get things so backwards?    And the \"intelligence\" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it.  For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat.  I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel.  Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys.  Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy.  So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum.  (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.)    And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth.  Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense.  Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind.  After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly \"signifies submission to the pack leader.\"  (Really?  Dogs use \"signifiers\" now?)    The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends!  He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!  They loved it!  So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it.  And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior.  Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality.     This \"through the looking glass\" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking.  Wha..?  I'm sorry.  I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail.  For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts.  I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book.",

I was so sad at the end of the War of Souls trilogy, as I thought it meant the end of the world of Krynn for me... I was wrong, and I celebrated the day I found out that Margaret and Tracy were writing prequels.  However, after the Star Wars debacle, I was slightly concerned that this was going to be a \"Phantom Menace\".   I am glad to say it is not.     This book takes place between Autumn Twilight and Winters Night, and revolves around Riverwind's evacuation of the Slave of Pax Tharkas after the rebellion, and Tanis, Raistlin, Sturm Caramon, Flint, and Tas's search for the Hammer of Kharas - used to make the Dragonlances.  This book focuses largely on Flint, which awesome considering that he played a much diminished role for the majority of the series.  Flint leads the companions in the search and has to deal with the dwarven bureaucracy and xenophobia in Thorbardin.  Compounding the difficulty is an especially clever and ambitious draconian who has fooled the world into thinking Lord Verminard still lives.  I swear, fans of Tas will love this book - as always he has some of the best lines and gets himself into the strangest situations.    My only criticism, [which is not aimed at the authors] and one shared by many reviewers, is the abysmal editing.  There were missing words, spelling errors, type-o's and so forth.  While this does not detract from the well-conceived plot, it does slow the natural flow of the read.  Hopefully the publishers will take an extra week for editing on the next instalment.     Anyhow, this was a great read for fans of the series!    Relic11",

What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.          Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books.

            "input": "Europe is so wonderful! So picturesque! (Too bad it's inhabited by all those Europeans.) . In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to \"do Europe\". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.    In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.    \"Neither Here Nor There\" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.    Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.    Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees \"the sights\" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.    This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.     But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:    1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.    2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.    3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.    4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.    This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:    \"Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team.\" (pg 32)    \"The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there.\" (pg 91)    \"In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide.\" (pg 97)    \"But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime.\" (pg 110)    \"I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people.\" (pg 123)    In conclusion, if you're someone who \"did Europe\" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.

I enjoy reading many different genres, but historical fiction is one of my favorites......and lately, the cultures of India, Sudan, and any of the countries in that exotic section of this wonderful world seems to satisfy my reading addiction.    THE TWENTIETH WIFE is a rich, exotic view of the women, their desires, and females' position in society in the Mughal Empire of 1600's India.    I could \"feel\" India as I read the story of Menhurrisa. This girl knew what she wanted at the early age of 8 and kept her focus on the love for a man she first saw in a parade. Almost all woman in that era would consider love for a man like this unattainable..........royalty above her class.     This was a book that I couldn't get enough of. I looked forward to the next page at all times. I enjoy reading a book that takes me mentally to another time and place. By reading this book, I learned a lot about the ancient 17th century Indian cultures of women and harem life, which had a class system of its own that the women had to deal with.    I highly recommend reading this book if you like historical fiction or if you enjoy reading a story of a strong woman who believes in herself and beats all odds to attain her desires.     I read this book about 2 1/2 years ago and the story has stayed in my memory. I bought the sequel, THE FEAST OF ROSES, last year and plan on reading it as soon as I finish the historical fiction novel that I am now reading set in 1500 England.    If you are looking for an awesome book, and very good historical fiction with surprising twists and turns spiced with a whole lot of action......this is a book you will truly devour.     I highly recommend this read.    B Harris",

This book would be a valuable tool for anyone interested in turning discord into harmony, both at home and at work.  The final section of the book suffers slightly from what felt to me like a shift in tone and emphasis. This part of the book seemed to be where the author became concerned with sharing his own personal worldview and therefore might be less useful for the hardcore business reader looking for workplace strategies to implement. That being said, I found this portion of the book to be interesting and enlightening to read simply as a human being and not as a \"business person\".   Highly recommended.",

Many of them are much less than 1,300 feet, indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size.     I live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that's about a hundred years old. But compared to the layout, the beauty the simplicity of design, mine's a dump. I'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend. One thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots. And such lots tend to be cheap. There's a new architect in town that's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys. Maybe if I give her this book, with a few houses marked. Hmmmmm!     One thing I didn't like, most of the bed rooms are on the second floor. I was in a house once that had a fire. The amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible. I don't want a bed room upstairs, if necessary I want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door.     Other than that, this is a great idea book. The pictures are beautiful. There's not as much detail as I would like, but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book, so I guess it's a nice balance",

For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.

The claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an IOU that the government writes to itself.     The book spends all of one paragraph (see page 28) on this critical issue, suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds, rather than government bonds, and concluding, \"It is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund's portfolio should make any difference.\" I just about threw the book across the room at that point!

I read the entire book and called the pr representative back and booked Chris for the entire show.

Well, I'd love to read a good book by that title and one might even copy the blurb texts and the table of contets of Woodhouse's book - all its weaknesses are in the fine print, so to say. The paradigm wars the title  refers to are meant to take place between &quot;traditional&quot;  (mechanistic, etc.) science and &quot;new age&quot; (holistic, etc.) world  views, which present levels of complexity not available to the traditional  approaches. No doubt such a war takes place presently... (1) It's an  obvious problem that the &quot;new&quot; paradigm is conceptualized as  being open and unfinished - together with the author's desire to  appropriate all nice and interesting recent scientific developments for his  side, one may at times wonder what the &quot;new paradigm&quot; is and what  limits it necessarily must have. (2) Woodhouse limits is attention more or  less to academic debate - but that's not primarily where the wars are being  fought. (Does he think it really matters? The climate in academic  institutions may depend on quite a number of factors beside rational  arguments...) The bullets fly right in our everyday life situatios - when  we see our physician and argue about a treatment (which may or may not be  paid by health insurance depending on the influence that &quot;traditional  scientists&quot; (aka drug manufacturers and their lackeys) have on the  insurance firm). It also takes place in firms striving for enhanced  effectiveness in the form of the question &quot;will it be possible to make  our employees work harder - or should we consider something new  altogether?&quot;. And it takes many more forms one does not even find  mentioned in this book. (3) On the fronts of these wars I know, the  situation looks rather bleak for new approaches. traditional doctrines are  well entrenched and have lots of powerful allies - economic shorttermism  advocating &quot;tried and true&quot; measures, traditional health  providers, genetic engineering firms, religious institutions producing cult  scares from time to time, etc. If you advocate divergent paradigms, you  need a lot of patience - and you're also faced with some serious problems  Woodhouse does not mention. Let me point here only to the fact that while  publicly recognized &quot;sciences&quot; have something like a memory in  terms of libraries and institutional continuity, &quot;new age  thought&quot; all to often starts all over again, repeats its standard  arguments and, in sum, doesn't get anywhere for lack of such a continuity,  for lack of references one could build on. Altogether, I'm sorry for the  money and for the time I spent on this book. Still, someone should write a  better one... - it's a worthy project, just a faulty implementation",

The writing was smooth and concise, with excellent flow, and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless.  Wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life, a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood, while also creating a certain honesty that (eventually) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like.  A side-effect of this detached viewpoint, however, is that at first I felt somewhat removed from what was happening.  But I slowly warmed up to the young Wolff, and by the end I came to cheer for him.  I also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up, feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words.  Wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest, tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear.  Overall I would recommend the book highly, and I plan on reading more from this author",

            "input": "Sad... . Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.'     The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.      Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom.     Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.",

As I read some of the reviews of people specifically one regarding David Ray Griffin books compared to this I must wonder about their motives. Although I have not read his books I read a few summaries, and concluded on some of the differences between them. David Ray Griffin seems to put all the blame and cover up on the Bush administration; it also seems to claim that there were explosives throughout the towers causing them to come down and not just the planes. It also claims that the pentagon plane never was a plane.     So how do you compare; Peter Lance doesn't claim that the Clinton administration or Bush Administration knowingly lied, it does however criticize both administrations for not looking into things like they should have. Obviously the Clinton Administration takes a harder hit here because they were in office from 93 - 00 when most of the planning took place. (yes I know it is hard for many bush haters not to put all the blame on Bush but this attack was planned well before Jan 1, 2001).     Peter Lance goes into extreme detail regarding the people involved in the 93 bombing and the people hunting/prosecuting them. There were so many things that were missed on all levels of our government from local police to the FBI to the white house. He does focus on the FBI's failure more than many other law enforcement because they are the group involved here at home. There are no conspiracy theories, the 93 world trade center attack happened; we know who did it. The USS Cole was attacked, Khobar Towers, the 2 embassies in Africa and 9/11. To suggest that some or any of these were committed or covered up by our goverment is insane.     Peter Lance details that there are people out there that are making their living trying to kill Americans and their allies. He gives us names, faces actual details. A history lesson in New York City law enforcment. There have been numerous books written about many of the same poeple or by the same people that Peter Lance mentions; John O'neil, Bob Baer etc... Read those books many say the same thing. SO is everyone on the government payroll covering up the White House Empires????    This book is based in facts that occured up to 9/11; it gives details and criticizes many people and administrations for not looking past the tips of their noses. It isn't based on conspiracy theories and is a great book. This book should be read by anyone wanting to know how inadequate our domestic law enforcment is at handling the new terrorist threat",

Having read this book in 1992 and recently purchased it for my collection, this a great read with various chapters based on history, politcal,and social mores of African- Americans  (in the black corner)and our archenemies White Americans (in the white corner). got to hype up the race war angle some of you white conservatives  who are doing it in your reviews about this book. If you have a politcal agenda you will either like or hate Hacker's book based on your politcal afilliation, If you are a Liberal, you may like the senstive and fair airing he gives towards the history of why we became two nations.If you are a conservative or Neo- Nazi type like the white racist from georgia that African- Americans have no morals,or you will hate that he's giving Black folks a pass on their moral problems.    Well as a Black Nationalist who  believes that intergration is bad social policy but a  majority Black commonwealth on American soil may be benefical, I think that historical factors presented in Hacker's book would  prevent both sides from ever seeing each other in any rational sense as Americans because    1. Whites see each other as  intellectually, morally superior to African - Americans (even the lowest white trash person) and will never consider them equal in the eyes of U.S. law or in their hearts    2. African - Americans (especailly males) will never forgive or forget what  the majority White population did to their families, culture, livelihoods and community structures especailly after Slavery.    Hacker has crafted an excellent book through great research and in many ways he is on point  throughout the book,  when he states  the the majority white population will make Hispanics and Asians \"honoray whites\" demonizing Black Males for politcal and social advantage against charges of racism by blacks. And many of your reviewers are right about some blacks hating whites, I think 387 years of continual defacto racism would create some blacks who would  hurt their fellow blacks (in a self- destructive way)  whites and other citizens (some blacks hate whites like the Arabs hate Jews).I consider that like the scene in the movie \"Independence Day\", when \"President\" Bill Pullman asked the Alien,     Pullman -  can there be peace between our worlds    Alien - NOOOOOOOOO NO PEACE !!!!    Pullman - What do you want from us?    Alien  I want you to DIE !!!!!    Let the hate mail begin !!!! at least I was \"candid\" in our so- called dicussion on race",

After \"L'Assommoir\" and \"Nana,\" I was accustomed to Zola's \"naturalist\" style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about Second Empire society. But \"Germinal\" surpasses those two, mainly due to Zola's efficiency. Middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading (no search engines or video games in the late 19th century), so it's understandable why \"Germinal\" is so saturated with detail. That being noted, this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading. Zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator, the movements of an enraged crowd, the gossiping wives of miners, etc., giving the reader a clear description of the sights, sounds and smells of the moment.    A few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism. While much of symbolism (the mine that eats the workers, the sufferings of Catherine and so on) could give that impression, this is story of disasterous ideology. Set in 1866-1867, when the Civil War in the U.S. exacerbated the coal industry's overcapitalization in France, Etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement (instead of Catherine) and sets off catastrophe. The episode in which Etienne, Chaval and Catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners.      There are a number of very interesting characters in this book, who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things. Sprinkled with references to Darwin, \"Germinal\" features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior. Whether Zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable, but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved. The change to the timbering rules by the company, the charge by the miners to Jean-Bart, and the act of sabotage by the Souvarine all have their disasterous unintended consequences. And it has been unintended consequences that defeated Marxism. In this way Zola was prophetic.    Chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that Etienne constantly battles. A very good website by a professor at Washington State mentioned that \"Chaval\" resembles \"cheval,\" which means \"horse.\" So the practicality, beast-of-the-mines existence of Chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story. In this way Chaval is a fully-developed character in \"Germinal.\"    Does this book have contemporary interpretations? During the week that I read this, there were two newspaper stories about coal mining. One in the weekend Milwaukee paper, told of a labor shortage in American coal mines, where in Pennsylvania and Ohio, veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave. Soon afterward, the N.Y. Times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central Henan province of China, showing a picture of thin, grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine, waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing. Given the (capitalist) history of the U.S. and the (Communist) history of China, would Zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in 2004?     Coal mining in the U.S., of course, is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election. Zola's \"Germinal\" is a masterpiece (I enjoyed the translation by Leonard Tanock), but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope.",

I got this book when I was starting out trying to add soy to my diet for better health.  I only knew about tofu  and I wasn't very creative with it either.  This book showed me how to make delicious, healthy versions of foods I really love like Potatoes au Gratin, Soy Milk Pancakes, Soy Cheese Corn Bread, Pizzas and Focaccia, Cream of Asparagus Soup, chowders, chilis, desserts, stews, Kung Pao Tempeh, Tofu Lasagne, manicotti,Cajun dishes and even Tiramisu, just to name a few. This book teaches how to use all the different soy products with easy to follow recipes that will give your menu fresh delights based on foods you already know and love.  Each recipe has complete nutritional information.  There are addresses and phone numbers for soy product sources and places to write for detailed soy information of a general nature.  The author's information about the various soy products is a very understandable and helpful introduction to this often overlooked and misunderstood group of foods.  Her personal notes about each recipe help make the dishes seem like they came from a trusted friend's kitchen. The best way to make a change in your diet is to make the change as subtle as you can so that your old habits will not be so tempting.  These recipes will make you glad you added soy to your diet and your body and the environment will thank you",

I thought I would come here and see what other folks are saying, and I'm not altogether surprised.  The first thing that continually surprises me when I read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is, in fact, well-written, if not even brilliant.  There is, of course, no accounting for taste.      What disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship (which suggests a lack in either education or practice) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views.  I urge those of you that see Bush as a righteous man to please \"read around.\"  There are, obviously, dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like God and George W. Bush will not even acknowlege, much less discuss, defend, or justify.  To ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed.  While I do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people, I am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts, or at least allows them to be performed, that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose.  Read other books and you will see.    One subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil.  I am not supporting them or denouncing our own, but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others.  Labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting, but that they fight simply to overcome those who \"love freedom.\"  This is from  page 114 of this very book, (a quote from Phyllis Wheatley) \"In every human breast, God has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom.\"  Here's a 'revolutionary' thought: Everybody loves and wants freedom.  If people are fighting they are fighting for freedom, we simply must ask one question: Freedom from what?  Read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question.  Also, see if you can discover, honestly and objectively, the freedoms that we are currently fighting for.    Another huge bother for me in this book is that Kengor refers to Texas as the largest state in the nation.  It's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement.    Another horrific, to my mind, thought is that Bush, and lots of his followers, truly believes that God wants him to be president.  A megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an \"I'm on a mission from God\" world view scares the hell out of me.",

In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.    The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.    In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.    I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.    The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.    The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, \"Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this.\"    If there ever were such days.",

In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence",

I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered.     I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.    If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there.",

There are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos, but when you read them, you would find the images are not so good at all, but not because of the photo itself, because of the low resolution. And if you are familiarize with those photos, you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution. It is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution.    However, when you first look into Full Moon, you will find you're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the Moon taken from Apollo Mission. Normally, owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s, all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution. However, Project Full Moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images. I can even tell you that, NASA even don't have such high resolution images before.

In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, \"cultural,\" religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.    Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict (\"Jihad\" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants (\"McWorld\" is Barber's label for this).

In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis.     Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing \"inductivism\" by \"deductivism.\" In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results.     But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier.     The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.    Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.    Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used.",

            "input": "A missing link for practitioners of \"hard\" martial arts. . Many buyers of this book are undoubtedly practitioners of \"hard\" arts seeking guidance on application of the more dubious moves of their disciplines in street confrontations. If readers expect to be instructed in realistic applications of Karate or Taekwondo blocks and stances, they may feel misled by the title since such subjects are barely touched upon.    MacYoung's purpose here is a different one. \"Hard\" arts generally teach practitioners to exchange blows at a certain distance. Grappling arts show how to fight an opponent from a clinch or on the ground. Authors like Geoff Thompson emphasize sizing up a potential attacker and resolving with pre-emptive strikes. What none of these address is how to handle the wild onrush of an attacker who has already initiated his assault and who is not going to stand back and trade blows.    This book aims to make \"hard\" martial arts street effective not by re-explaining their existing techniques but by filling in certain gaps, principally by applying \"soft\" blocking and takedown concepts from Wing Chun and Silat. Karate/Taekwondo practitioners may find this difficult to reconcile with their own styles - unless they subscribe to the opinion (not addressed in this book) that the \"hard\" arts once had a considerable \"soft\" content, and that movements like those now labelled \"blocks\" were originally something else altogether - but is a valuable and effective complement nevertheless. The book also includes good advice on the nature of violence and how to avoid it, and emphasizes \"winning while escaping\".    Stylistically, MacYoung's easygoing tone and humour may or may not please, but behind it is a well written book which succeeds in communicating concept and technique in words. Some sections can at first seem repetitive or difficult to follow (not helped by the lack of clear labelling of photos - my one major gripe), but this is due to the complexity of the concepts examined. This book requires more than one reading to get the most out of it, and will certainly reward those willing to do so.",

I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.

The use of specific examples  illustrates the techniques, while complicated backround information is  well-organized in the Appendices.

It covers all availble techniques, from the  simplest to the most advanced ones, with full explanation of the theory,  with complete and detailed implementation steps for a wide range of signal  processing algorithms.Since the book does not deal with the design at the  physical level, but with transformations of the processing algorithms so  that their VLSI implementations will satisfy certain criteria of  optimality, it is not absolutely mandatory that the reader has already  taken courses in VLSI design, although this could help appreciate the  benefits offered by the techniques detailed in the book. The exercises  found at the end of each chapter help the reader apply the learned  techniques in all kinds of applications.

In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, \"Okay, give it your best shot!\"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn",

They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.      I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.    Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.    As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.     The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.     I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin",

The themes are the same in each story: aging male professor with an itchy prostate faces a mid-life situation, usually involving his younger second wife. That may sound too specific to relate to all of the stories in this collection, but you would be disappointed to realize that it is very accurate. The lone exception, and the novel's best story, is the titular work about a nun who is, in point of fact, a whore's child -- and the discrepancy between the generations makes for a poignant story. And yet, even that one includes a male professor character who is teaching the nun in his creative writing class, so similarities remain. Despite that, the story is great. The rest ... well, if Russo had done away with the other six achingly similar stories and expanded them into a single novella the book would have been much better. Russo is certainly capable of spinning a great yarn, and the themes are fine if a little familiar (Russo seems to be an author that excells in that domain).

I've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in Andre Norton's Witch World.    This author kept me turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero, Simon Tregarth gets himself into, but also for glimpses of a strange new, magical landscape.  She doesn't pile on the adjectives, either.  Her prose is remarkably clean.  Just read the lead sentence of \"Witch World,\" which introduces us to ex-soldier, Simon Tregarth:    \"The rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street, washing soot from city walls, the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall, thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings, watching the mouths of doorways, the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness.\"    He is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.    After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.    The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.    Simon allies himself with \"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.  Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.    The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.    Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.  Simon, his friend Koris of Gorm, the witch he rescued from the Hounds of Alizon, and a youthful soldier called 'Briant' tread the mysterious byways of Estcarp and its warring neighbors, in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens.    Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.  There are 35 Witch World (WW) fantasies, and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on March 17, 2005.   Many of the later WW novels were collaborations, and it wouldn't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the Grand Master created.   I wish them well, but so far they have not managed to penetrate the brilliantly weird landscapes of Andre Norton's imagination.",

All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from.    Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them?    Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time.    So go to class. All the time.

I can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as I also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth.  The longings Jane Louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar.  This book will not hit you over the head with a message, and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us.  And I for one sometimes enjoy a book that doesn't leave me with a headache.  Reading is so much like eating - balancing what's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that aren't - and for me, Laurie Colwin's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon.

Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read.    I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called \"Madison at Guignol\" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word \"Guignol\" in the title.)    Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better",

It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime.    We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will.    This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about.    The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, \"this is somebody else's fault\" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done.    If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record. I read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom I heard so much growing up. I now wish I didn't know 4/5ths of what I now do know about you.

These & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read, as their lives intertwine again & again, on so many levels.

Actually, Felton explains at the beginning that these are not forty consecutive days because some of the projects require a change of thinking, such as finally feeling that you can invite someone into your home. It's more accurately described as forty projects than forty days.     Felton offers ideas as varied as dealing with the paper crunch, saving time, e-mail, organizing closets, efficient movements, developing a visitor-friendly attitude, and upgrading your home. (No, she doesn't mean blowing it up and starting from scratch as my mom has suggested!) She gives the reader permission to reject whatever projects don't work for you while developing a new style of thinking.     Felton is an engaging writer with a practical, friendly style. She lets readers struggling with clutter not feel guilty. Angry yes, guilty no. Most chapters include several helpful pointers and boxed quotations to encourage you such as, \"If you can't move the mountain, move a few stones. If there is a better solution...find it,\" by Thomas Edison. The book ends with a resource bibliography.     One of the good things about the book is that she provides options for you to consider and suggests you choose one that you feel comfortable with. For instance, in her chapter on making bold judgment calls, she gives you eleven project choices which range from dropping out of a club, giving up addressing Christmas cards by hand, throwing out all mail with a bulk postmark unopened, rotating your visible knickknack collections, using paper plates for quick clean up, and more.     Some of her suggestions sound familiar to me because I've read one or two of her books over the years, so those who have read some of her other books may want to look this one over before purchasing it. Those who are new to the struggle to organize their lives will find her ideas helpful and her writing engaging. - Debbie W. Wilson, Christian Book Previews.com",

I've been in the software industry for quite awhile, and I've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh.  While there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform, there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine.     This book, in summary, is the longwinded rant of one such user. As someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book, and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book, I believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking, without any real interviews (or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed).    There are so many factual errrors in this book, its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time, to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know-- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions.     This is a smear job, thru and thru, and like most smear jobs its repetitive, self-contradictory, and downright dishonest.    I think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves.

James Patterson's work over a decade ago stopped consistently being masterpiece after masterpiece and became very hit and miss with very average novels published throughout most of his recent career, with only the odd great read every now and then published, with readers just keep picking up each successive novel hoping the old quality will be back.  Well I'm pleased to say, it is back with The Angel Experiment.  I must admit I was very surprised as Patterson's last attempt at the children's market SantaKid, well as those of us unfortunate enough to have read it know, pitiful is being nice.  With Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment, quality is achieved albeit for a much older children's market than SantaKid.  Well actually I don't even know why the publishers say this is a kids book (young adult) as it is even more violent than the two adult novels in this series and although it has been a while since I read When the Wind Blows and The Lake House I didn't really notice any differences in the way they are written.   Obviously it's just a marketing thing by the publishers to sell more books in this series.  Although you could read this as a stand alone novel you really do need to have previously read the two adult novels before this as well to understand and enjoy this story to its full extent, so marketing this and the subsequent novels in this series as a younger age group doesn't make much sense but adults will love this book anyway.     In Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment, Max and the five other kids with wings are back for the third instalment in the series.  They are happily living in their secluded hide out which Jed, the good scientist from the School who unfortunately met his demise in the previous books set up for them.  Their peaceful existence is smashed however when the youngest girl Angel is taken by Erasers (bad creations from the school).  Max takes control and organises a rescue mission where the children all discover they have other powers they haven not tapped into yet. The mission will take them not only to the rural school but to New York and the answers to their past they so have longed for all their lives.  Some unpleasant surprises are on the way for Max and the others that will repulse them beyond any level they've endured before!",

The Republican party is cashing in now, but future generations will have to pay off the mounting debt (I thought conservatives were supposed to be fiscally responsible types).  What may be even worse, the Republicans are alienating people and nations all over the world.  Sure, we're the superpower now, but nothing lasts forever.  Do you want other nations to give us a helping hand or kick us when we're down?  That depends on how we treat other nations now, while we have power.  Pre-emptively invading countries doesn't win any brownie points.    The Democrats get criticized for being too moderate and too nice.  Instead of using the same dirty tricks and viscious political rhetoric that the Republicans use, the Democratic Party just sits back and takes the blows.  This isn't good for the image of the party.  Also, Rall believes that the Democratic Party is too disorganized.  There is no central message for liberals everywhere.  There are only small groups who only care about their own issues.  If the Democrats hope to come back to power, they're going to have to get their act together.  This book is an interesting read for those who consider themselves free thinkers",

            "input": "Some good advice, but he lost me at \"obey\" . Adams is clearly a thoughtful Christian man who cares about husbands and wives. My problem: his definition of those roles are too old-fashioned and rigid for my taste. Just so you know, I am not a liberal woman who either ignores the Bible or is ignorant of its teaching; I know the Biblical teachings on marriage and it is their instructions I disagree with Adams about. He consistently calls the wife the \"helper\", which diminishes the aspect of partnership that I believe marriage should be. A leader and a helper is not a partnership, it is basically one central figure and a secondary figure who helps them. Adams stresses the specialness of a helper to uplift the concept, but is apparently unaware that the role still pushes a sense of lesserness on the woman's side because, if a wife is a helper, who is she helping? The husband! The man is still the central figure and the wife is not seen as his mate, but his \"helper\", a moon revolving around a sun. His beliefs basically come from the age-old concept of, in regards to a wife's role, taking the Biblical word \"Submit\" and turning it into \"obey\". Honey, they're not the same. Submission, unlike obedience, can be mutual and does not always have to do with authority. The concept of marital submission, I believe, is basically to surrender to another's needs and put the other before oneself; this does not at all necessarily mean obeying! Therefore, Adam's words that the husband is never to submit to the wife were incorrect. Certainly the husband is never supposed to obey his wife, but he is clearly expected to submit to her needs. The Bible stresses the importance of the husband laying down his life for his wife if necessary; that is HUGE submission on the husband's part. Submitting to a spouse should not be a matter of one ruling over the other, but rather a matter of both spouses making sacrifices out of love and respect for each other.     Adams' words of wifely obedience were very grating to me, especially when he tried giving examples of when a wife should refuse a sinful \"command\" from her husband. If a husband freely commands his wife, we've got bigger problems than whether the command itself is sinful or not. Adam's advice for the wife to \"respectfully\" refuse a sinful command also rather threw me, since his example of a sinful command was if a husband wanted his wife to play spouse-swap with another couple. His idea of what to say to such a husband? \"I must respectfully say no. You must not ask me to sin and I cannot do that.\" Firstly, if a husband actually had the nerve to ask his wife to do something like that (or command it, in Adams' words), he'd be lucky if a disrespectful answer was all he got. Secondly, I defy anyone to find a self-respecting wife who actually talks that way. The monotone of that robotic answer gave me the impression that Adams' taken this obedience thing a little too far. This impression was strengthened with his example of how a counselor should advise a woman who \"has not been a good helper\". His advice: \"They (wives) must be trained to put on helpful deeds, a step many counselors overlook.\" Maybe counselors overlook this because the concept of training women to be obedient helpers is, rightly, obsolete for most people.     Books like these, which so rigidly define the roles of spouses, have a tendency to simultaneously overcomplicate and oversimplify marriage (not an easy thing to do, but they manage). They oversimplify marriage because they seem to believe that if women just obey and respect their husbands and if husbands just love and nurture their wives, the marriage will go swimmingly. It is NOT that simple! Marriage is not a recipe with instructions, it's a union between two people who will occassionaly have conflicting ideas, and conflicts will NOT magically vanish if one spouse always gives in to the other. This method also overcomplicates things because it stresses the idea of training women to be followers rather than just letting them be led by love and respect for their husbands and letting the rest fall into place on its own.     Every marriage is different; it should be Godly, of course, but you cannot make the roles of spouses cookie-cutter. Christian books tend to do this mainly as a result of the author taking the Bible too literally. Adams does this by saying that, because the Bible tells the husband and not the wife to love, loving is primarily the husband's job. He went on to say that, if a husband complains that there is little love in the marriage, his counselor should tell him that it's mainly his fault! Honestly, this alarmed me more than his earlier words about counselors training women to be helpers (what kind of counselors are these, anyway?). To automatically blame either spouse for a marital problem based on your personal interpretation of the Bible instead of what's actually happening in the marriage is a little scary (if a professional counselor does this, it's downright terrifying). The interpretation itself is rather skewed; the Bible stresses on women giving respect and men giving love because respect is something that most men already give naturally and love is already something that women give naturally. It does NOT mean that the husband is the only one who has to love and the wife only has to respect, so to blame a lack of love automatically on the husband is simply unfair and silly. There are plenty of women who have a hard time loving and men who have a hard time respecting; you cannot simply assume which spouse is at fault because of Biblical instructions.     This is not a bad book, but unless you view marriage in the same rigid terms as Adams, it probably won't do much for you. If it focused more on mutual love and respect rather than defining one sort of behavior for one particular spouse, it would've worked a lot better for me.",

I'm interested by all the reviewers who claim this book is a good one despite the racist stereotypes of \"savage\" natives because, they say, it's \"the truth.\"  The review before mine is especially interesting; he proclaims to love the book and reads it to his children as it teaches about defending your home against terrorism.  Reviewers like myself are just spewing \"liberal diatribe.\"  Another reviewer asks \"as for the savages, who was attacking who?\"      Everyone thinks of the scenario of little Edward and his innocent family just living their lives until these terrible Indians come along and want to wipe them out.  In the interest of historical truth, would you look at it another way?    Think of your home and neighborhood.  You may have lived there for years, or you may have just moved from a neighboring town.  You participate in community activities, your children are educated with your neighbors children, you attend religious services.  Then one day, a group of foreign soldiers come into your neighborhood, and say it now belongs to them.  As Americans, how would you feel if a group of Italian, English, Russian, French, etc., soldiers did this?  They claim the neighborhood in the name of their government and demand that you leave your home and go elsewhere.      Pretend no telephones, telegraph, or internet exist.  You go to your government and tell them about the soldiers, but they have no way of notifying the foriegn soldiers government that this land is already settled.  Your government sends an army to eject the soldiers, but is defeated.  Eventually you have to leave.  The soldiers keep coming, and it's not long before families from the soldiers land come as well.  They keep expanding further and further, and forcing you and your family to keep moving, killing many of your family and friends.      Eventually all of you have had enough of this treatment - instead of fighting only their soldiers, your leaders get small citizen's armies together to attack their settlements as they have yours.  Now, who is the terrorist in this case?      If you want your children to know the historical truth, you should tell them the whole truth.  Comparing the original inhabitants of North and South America to the 9-11 terrorists is not accurate.  Comparing the european invaders - let me see, they killed the natives who wanted to keep the land they'd lived on for centuries, and forcibly converted them to european religions, as the native religions were \"heathen.\"      If you believe everything I've written is just \"liberal diatribe,\" go on happily reading this book to your kids, with no true historical references.

In other words, one should discover the real Self, who is the final answer to all questions. Every question that arises is vitiated by the ignorance which takes the ego at its face value, as the real Self. All questions are therefore reducible to one, 'Who am I?'. This question is the Quest of the Self, by which the egoless state is won.&quot; For the person who's ears are ready to hear, this book is sweet music indeed!!",

Most of the reviews above are political diatribes against Keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something COULD be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't. expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place. Although difficult to read, this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics. Far from being destructive, it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930's. I recommend you read this book",

            "input": "Redundant and uninteresting . I obtained this book with the hope that it would build on the themes I encountered in another book I'm reading (Destructive Trends in Mental Health).  As a practicing experimental psychologist, I have observed first hand the strengths and weaknesses of the field of psychology.  Unfortunately, McIntyre failed to deliver.      First, the book is short on ideas and repeats them often.  Having biases is bad (he scapegoats religious and political ideologies).  Social scientists aren't brave enough (the author seems to idolize Galileo and Darwin).  Social scientists whine too much (about how *hard* their science is - my whining is in the next paragraph).  Social scientists need to look at the data instead of relying on armchair theorizing.  People don't really want to understand human behavior.  Yep, I think that's about it.  Now, repeat this in as many ways as possible and you can stretch it into a very short book.      The author turns a good word and thus the book is an easy read (thus the two stars).  As much as I might agree with some of his points, he overstates them (he caricatures social scientists as ignorant ideologues uninterested in data) and misses many important ones regarding the challenges of the field.  If I had as much control over humans as physicists and chemists have over their subject matter, things would be a lot easier.  So-called \"hard\" scientists don't have to ask the subjects of their inquiry if they want to participate in their experiments.  They also have much greater control of extraneous variables (Can I *please* be allowed to raise humans in the lab??? Can I *please* be allowed to run experiments on societies, governments, races, companies, ...  by changing their laws, rules, structures, income, etc. to my hearts content?).      The book would have been much less repetitious if he would have seriously considered the other challenges facing the social sciences instead of assuming that they're all easily surmountable.  Hint: Think weather prediction and you'll better understand the challenges of the social sciences.  The author needs to check his own biases at the door - it's obvious that he's a liberal atheist (as he was free to admit).      In sum - read the second paragraph of my review and you've gotten the gist of the author's message.  Skip the book.",

            "input": "Great Source on Culinary History,Business, and Lore . `The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons.    So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors.    It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows.    These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy.    By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals.    Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as www.foodtv.com, but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com. This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars.    Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment.",

He examines all forms of paganism/  spiritualism, Satan's original religion from Eden until now (the Dragon),  Roman Catholicism (the Beast), and apostate Protestantism (the False  Prophet). Sutton shows how these three forces are working together to  effect the downfall of humanity today, in the years immediately preceeding  the Second Coming of Christ. Too strong a comment?

When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.      In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.     Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.    Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.      Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.    Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid.",

If you want to get an \"inside view\" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!    What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!    I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.    I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..",

Jung obviously devoted considerable time & effort into the study of alchemy--because he perceived an amazing parallel with his theories/model of the psyche & the process of individuation.  I think it amazed him that the alchemists intuitively evoked such general principles of transcendental alchemy prior to the development of western science--indeed, they were simultaneously immersed in this development such that modern chemistry evolved from it.  Oddly, some are now advocating the use of chemicals (drugs) in lieu of psychology--e.g. for schizophrenia.  Maybe the tail is wagging the horse?  Of course, this is a difficult text.  The alchemical series may be the most difficult of Jung's already difficult texts.  But, as Jung demonstrated himself, sometimes the way to learn is to just jump in feet first--absorb as you can.  Eventually, the material will start to sink in--subconsciously if not consciously.  Give it a whirl.  This text also has some VERY interesting quotes:    p. 82 \"There is something serious in every joke.    p. 125 If one does not understand a person, one tends to regard him as a fool.    p. 200 It seems as if Christianity had been from the outset the religion of chronic squabbles, and even now it does everything in its power never to let the squabbles rest.  Remarkably enough, it never stops preaching the gospel of neighborly love.    p. 376 The creative mystic was ever a cross for the Church, but it is to him that we own what is best in humanity...'where there is no vision, the people perish...The mystics are channels through which a little knowledge of reality filters down into our human universe of ignorance and illusion: A totally unmystical world would be a world totally blind and insane...the few theocentric saints who exist at any given moment are able in some slight measure to qualify and mitigate the poisons which society generates within itself by its political and economic activities.  In the gospel phrase, theocentric saints are the salt which preserves the world from decay.' (quoting Aldous Huxley in Grey Eminence 1943, pp. 98, *296.    p. 487 Fantasies always mean something when they are spontaneous.    p. 519 Never do human beings speculate more, or have more opinions, than about things which they do not understand.    p. 536 Nothing changes anything else without itself being changed.\"  How profound can you get",

            "input": "Compelling Coming-of-Age Tale . The title of this novel would lead one to believe that it's about the life of a student in college, but that's not exactly the case.  Sure, part of it takes place at college, but in truth it's more of a coming-of-age story;  a young man's attempt to reconcile his working class, suburban upbringing with the wealth and intellectual glamour he discovers at prestigious Yale University.  It's a well-told and compelling tale, and, like other Perrotta novels, leaves one with something to think about at its end.     We meet Danny in his junior year as he is finally coming into his own.  He's established himself intellectually, he's got new and interesting friends, and he's even a bit of a celebrity in that he's an integral part of a newly-minted literary magazine.  It's now been more than two years since he came to school and his home-town ties are slowly disintegrating.  But some are more difficult to abandon than others.      His father, for one, owns a lunch truck, or roach coach.  In a mid-life change of careers, he's decided to become his own man, to run his own business.  But it is stressful work, and damaging to his health.  Danny finds that he must spend all his vacation time helping him.  Then there is the girl Danny met from his old high school.  She's a secretary now, at a run-of-the-mill, small industrial plant.  He goes out with her knowing full well that the relationship will never blossom into anything.  He is aware he is using her.      Although Danny is doing well, grade-wise, he is painfully aware of all of the shenanigans going on around him, some of which he participates in.  A girl has basically moved into his suite with one of his roommates.  Other roommates smoke dope.  Another spends his time in fascination with assassins of American presidents.  Everybody drinks way, way too much.  One evening, while cavorting with a female on the campus grounds, he is ridiculed by a student-actor dressed as the \"fool\" from Shakespeare's King Lear.  Is this why our parents spend thousands and thousands of dollars a year?  He thinks.    With his background, he is able to view these goings-on through the eyes of the average working-stiff American, and without ever explicitly saying why, finds that he is ashamed.  His actions, sometimes reckless, sometimes foolish, seem to indicate a subconscious desire to be punished.  This conflict is unresolved by novel's end.      It is unlikely that this novel will ever win a Pulitzer Prize, or even be nominated for one.  There is no huge encompassing theme, there are no substantial truths revealed, there is no scathing indictment of society.  None of that.  It is, however, a tautly told, bright, compelling narrative with characters one would expect to meet in real life.      It is, frankly, the type of thing which present-day aspiring authors should strive for.  The average reader is not interested in being dazzled by an author's research or bombarded with symbolic references to Freud, he is interested in being told a good story.  If an author does this well enough and often enough, all of those other elements--the ones which make a novel great--will fall into place.  Indeed, they did so in Mr. Perrotta's most recent effort, the excellent Little Children.  Joe College works because, at the very least, it is a fine example of the art of storytelling.",

Having chewed and digested \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" and \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked \"true\" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, \"20,000 Leagues\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.    Professor Arronax leaves a \"normal\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \"modern\" or \"known\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.    Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.     The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.    However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in...    ...The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?    A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic",

            "input": "Good for a skim, that is all . This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.    In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution \"intelligently\" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.    Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.    Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled \"The Formula for Intelligence\", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or \"intelligent\" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly \"smarter\" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.    Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create \"strong AI.\"  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.    Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.    Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  \"the majority of reading is done on displays\", \"the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition\", and \"intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel.\"  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to \"predict\" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.    Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here",

A group of anarchists (well-funded ones) have discovered a way to force a polar shift of the magnetic north and south pole.  By doing so, they hope to destroy the world's navigation and communication infrastructure, allowing their heavily shielded replacements to survive as the only game in town.  The only thing that can stop them is a young woman who is the granddaughter of the original scientist who learned about the shift decades.  She doesn't know that she holds the key to reversing the polarity, but NUMA and Austin have to find her before the others get there first...    I didn't expect blockbuster material here, just a fun read.  And basically that's what I got.

In PHINEAS FINN, Anthony Trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young Irish Member of Parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the Liberal government. A dispute with his party regarding the Irish question, however, results in his leaving politics and returning to Ireland.    PHINEAS REDUX brings Phineas back, but the slogging is now harder. The vicious infighting between Daubeny (Disraeli) and Gresham (Gladstone) has soured Phineas somewhat. He is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named Quintus Slide; and many in his party, including some of his friends, believe that the Irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with Lady Laura Kennedy. At one point, the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at Phineas, but misses. Matters turn still darker when J. Bonteen, a political rival to Phineas, is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with Phineas at the Universe Club.    The major set piece of PHINEAS REDUX is the trial of Phineas Finn for the murder of Bonteen. Opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until Mme Max Goesler, whose love Finn had rejected in the earlier volume, conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal.    If Trollope were a lesser author, everything at this point would be all sweetness and light. Here, however, Phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether. What Trollope presents us with is an updated version of the Book of Job, with the difference that Phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses. His good friends rally round the young M.P. and slowly wean him from his depression.     The pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is Mme Max. Phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted",

Judging by the numerous 5 star ratings,  some people presume to learn from Robins' style of writing and illustrating an art instruction book.  Moreover,  Robins  subtitles the \"Art of Figure Drawing\" as : \"THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE CLASSICAL TRADITION\";   well, it isn't!   It is anything BUT a complete guide to the \"classical tradition\".  In fact,  it is exactly the opposite of the \"classical tradition\" for teaching drawing.        Before purchasing this book,  the reader should do a web-search for LUCA  CAMBIASO  (born  1527   died  1585).     Luca  Cambiaso,  Genoese painter    began using  simplified cubic shapes as a kind of shorthand drawing style,  and is believed to have been the author of  the method of dividing the human body into small squares in order to give correct proportions.      Art authorities believe that Rennaissance Masters passed  \"pattern books\" to their students for study.  Of these,  Luca Cambiaso's  drawings are about all that remain of these  \"block figure\"  rough sketches.  Some of these can be found on the internet,  just to give you an idea.         At any rate,  the point I am making here is that these \"block figures\"   [which Jack Hamm calls  SIMPLIFIED  FIGURETTES ]  are at the core of the   CLASSICAL  TRADITION.                       Robins fails to include  block figure, human puppet, or simplified figurette  drawings that must be part of a book referencing the \"classic drawing techniques,\"    because such block figures are much represented in books genuinely invested in \"the classic tradition\".               I do not really understand why,  but it is quite common today,  for authors NOT FOLLOWING the CLASSICAL   TRADITION  to claim exactly the opposite.  They claim to teach the CLASSICAL TRADITION, but they DO NOT?   To be blunt,  it's a rip-off of some kind.           Robins is entirely misleading in his title. Rather than being invested in \"the classical tradition\"    Robins is vested in the \"contemporary perspectives\" approach to figure drawing.      Classical Tradition per se,  is more represented in books by Walt Reed, or Jack Hamm  &    Edgar Loy Fankbonner  &   others where   BLOCK FIGURE or HUMAN PUPPET drawings, along with intermediate steps for refining rough sketches by degree, make up the real  \"classical tradition\".     (I know I'm being repetitive here,  but I simply insist on making the point!)          Another fundamental flaw in Robins method, is that he offers what one Amazon book reviewer has termed,  \"Invisible Problem Solving,\"  whereby the final drawings are shown, avoiding the beginning or intermediate steps which are used to arrive at final drawings.          The last MANGA drawing book I peeked at contained no less than 70 pages (out of a total of 190 pages)  on human...(HUMAN,  not CARTOON, mind you)  anatomy using a HONEGUMI skeleton for illustration.  This included basic instruction that any COMPLETE guide ought to have:  how to draw human eyes,  ears (from front and back view),  nose,  mouth,  musculature and bone structure.   In this regard,  the use of a basic anatomical device  such as a HONEGUMI skeleton or \"simplified figurette\" as Jack Hamm calls them,  is fundamental to basic drawing.  And this is my criticism of Clem Robins;  that he has titled his book  a \"complete guide\" but it certainly excludes beginning students as a target audience.           The price is too high,   when there are more thorough guides to human figure drawing still in print for less, some of them published over 50 years ago.  Mr. Robins himself recommends George Bridgman to the book buyer, over his own text, so what's the point anyway?  The point is,  that whether by  publisher or individual author,  the \"how-to-draw\" market is flooded with books that some will buy,  confident that they are acquiring the very best of the figure drawing tradition.  I would shrink from a purchase that contains an author's  personal  CAVEAT EMPTOR.",

            "input": "History of Google, Not Search Engines . Though I'm coming to a review of The Search a year too late, I can explain why. I bought the book on its release, very excited to read some good journalism about the hottest business topic of the day. I was sure that Battelle, who had been chronically his progress on the book on his own blog, would deliver. Halfway through the book (in a matter of three days - a possible sign pointing to its lack of depth) I'm realizing that this is not the case.     Thus far, I have two major gripes with the book. The first is the writing itself.  The book is written in informal magazine style, in keeping with his roots as a \"cutting edge\" technology writer (having worked for Wired and Business 2.0, magazines that try desperately to be \"too cool for the room\").     This would be fine enough, except that Battelle has a habit of jumping around from year to year, talking about decisions made by players in Google's history before he actually introduces them. He never fully explains why it was important for Sergey Brin and Larry Page - Google's founders - to resign their chairman and CEO posts, nor does he tell the reader what their new titles are. Battelle also has a habit of reintroducing people several times, a practice which at times seems a cheap way to up his page count. His writing style thoroughly muddles however much thoughtfulness there was to his project. I considered keeping a tally of how many times he used \"well\" as an interjection, but lost interested after I ran out of fingers.     On page 150 he discusses a lack of managerial prowess on the part of Brin, Page and new CEO Eric Schmidt. According to Battelle, one of Google's investors, John Doerr, insisted that Intuit founder Bill Campbell come on as a leadership coach. Battelle uses an anecdote from journalist John Heilemann's GQ article on Google, which quotes Doerr as saying, \"I don't know where the company would be without him.\" However, Battelle doesn't include any of his own reporting on what Campbell actually did. Neglecting to explain right away what this `miraculous' shift was is, in my own journalistic view, irresponsible. Not to mention that he doesn't include the actual title of Heilemann's article in either the main book or the citations.     Later in the book on page 172, he tries to play the role of not only a technology writer, and search historian, but also media theorist and critic, waxing about how Google ought to be considered a media company - not just a technology company.    In the book's final chapter, Battelle introduces the idea of having several different kinds of information contribute to \"perfect search,\" including every tech writer and journalist's favorite idea, the blog. He bulldozes through a description of the blog and later posits that we have reached the critical mass point, \"but we don't know it yet.\" I suspect that Battelle means that he's savvier than users and other writers and he knows something we don't, but he doesn't explain why he thinks we've reached the tipping point, nor what that means in the overall discussion of what the blog can do.     Though Battelle tries to play his book as a \"history of search,\" it is nowhere near as comprehensive as such a book must be. It is a book that sings the praises of Google, nothing more. However, that the book is a history of Google is fine. The company certainly is interesting and large enough to warrant an historical account and Battelle ought to be forthcoming with his intent. The short discussions he does include of the company's search engine precursors such as Lycos and Alta-Vista need considerable expansion and deserve to be considered as more than also-rans, if he really wants to be considered the historian of search and not just Google's unofficial corporate historian.",

At how high a level can it be maintained?   What restrictions are placed by the available resources, such as food and water?      This book asks many of the right questions.  And it admits that we don't have all the answers.  But it does give some clues about where we may be headed.    Cohen shows that basically, if we want to support people indefinitely on 3500 kilocalories per day from wheat energy, with 9000 cubic kilometers of annual fresh water supply, well, we can support only 5 billion people.  We're already beyond that.  Right now, we're using up resources at an incredible rate.  And while the Earth could support 10 billion people in theory, it is hard to see how it could do that for long in practice.    The author thinks that we'll never get to the absolute maximum that the Earth can support.  Most people would all be right on the edge of starvation, and we'd simply be unable and unwilling to stay in that state indefinitely.  But I did realize after reading this book that we could stay at about 5 billion people for a very long time if we put our minds to it.  Standards of living would not be high, but they would be tolerable for the majority, and the ones who found such a life acceptable would keep having children who found it acceptable.    Those of us who have political views ought to wonder if time is on our side or not.  And that is why I think it makes sense to try to imagine what options are available for our mutual future.  That's why I think this book is worth reading",

To see it that way will only mislead you. Neoconservatism's roots have sprouted from the left more than the right. The current GOP \"may be Reaganite in its tax policy, but it is Wilsonian in its foreign policy, FDR in its trade policy, and LBJ all the way in its spending policies. Pragmatism is the order of the day. The Republican philosophy might be summarized thus: \"To hell with principle; what matters is power, and that we have it, and that they do not.\"    But when one becomes one's enemy, who won?    Conservatives are nationalists. Neoconservatives are internationalists. Conservatives are protectionists. Neoconservatives are free traders. Conservatives see the culture war as essential. Neoconservatives see it as a distraction. Conservatives believe in defending the land militarily and project our ideals by example. Neoconservatives believe in defending it offensively and projecting our ideals by force.    The neoconservatives and presidential candidate George W. Bush were a match on domestic policy in 2000 (Bush didn't propose a single spending cut in his campaign), but it appears that they hijacked his foreign policy, whatever it used to be. (Given the events of his presidency, it's a startling reminder that this same president couldn't name four world leaders when he was quizzed during the 2000 campaign.) That foreign policy was the defense and advancement of world democracy, something that has never been America's aim. The only proactive foreign policy we've ever had was the Truman Doctrine, a stance we took when the Soviet menace showed itself to be aggressive and a real threat to the United States, our allies, and our real interests. The Clinton interventions, misguided as they were, were at least brief and limited, nothing that risked expansion into a long-term, regional conflict. The same cannot be said of Iraq.    Mr. Buchanan gives a chapter-length history of Islam and Europe, setting the scene for 9/11. The following war in Afghanistan was just and necessary, and quite a diplomatic masterpiece, one that could have been the foundations for better relations with the Middle East, which had shown considerable support for our efforts against al Qaeda. Iran, an al Qaeda enemy, voluntarily offered help in Afghanistan, but Bush soon after named it among the \"axis of evil\". The neocons had attached their agenda to the unclear war on terror to advance a war on Iraq, a war that the neocons had pursued for years, and to be followed with a frightening series of wars throughout the region. The war on terror evolved into a quest for worldwide democracy, buffered with a moral imperative that our diseased culture violates in almost every way, and with the unrealistic belief that the Middle East wants democracy, even though they've never chosen it themselves. Mr. Buchanan also offers a study of terrorism, and what a touchy thing it is: the weapon of the weak, the reaction to empire, the stuff of martyrdom.    With new bases in central Asia, the invasion of Iraq, and talk of much more war, the neocons were starting to frighten the world. China, now surrounded by U.S. bases, began building and tailoring its military for our encirclement, and leading the all-offense neocons to believe that war with them could be expected, even though their going to war with us would have been suicide. China wasn't just preparing for us: it was reacting to us. The neocons were reacting to a world of their own making: filled with nations that wouldn't war with us if they were democratic. This is utterly divorced from conservatism, historic American foreign policy, and moral, Constitutional, and realistic restraint. Perhaps it's for the best in the long term that Iraq didn't turn out; that madness seems to be coming to an end. Even the neocons seem to believe that failure is now an option.    Mr. Buchanan then turns to the domestic issues: the disaster of free trade, the continuance of big government, and the imperial judiciary. However, about all you'll find is that neoconservatives are a problem in the sense that they're not the solution. Cultural issues have given them plenty of chances to fight and solidify their base, but they've been silent, and often quick to fund whatever nonsense demanded funding to keep the issue from open debate and away from the hands of the Democrats. Neoconservatives seem to have concluded that big government gets votes, and that social issues are a distraction. But the culture war truly began with the horrid Warren court, while Congress didn't use its Constitutional power to hold it back. The neoconservative GOP seems too focused on bad foreign and economic policy to be concerned with the judicial usurpation of power it wasn't meant to have. Neoconservatism hasn't corrected wrongs; it has created more of them.    I was hoping for some answers to an overall question I've had about neoconservatism: where is all of this going? How do massive debts get paid when spending is out of control and manufacturing is sent overseas? Where does peace begin after perpetual war? Mr. Buchanan doesn't offer anything here but the question. Perhaps that's for the neocons themselves. Perhaps even they don't know.    \"Where the Right Went Wrong\" could be the prequel to \"State of Emergency\" in that this book is a good summary of Bush's first term, whereas the latter defines the pressing issue of the second. However, this book includes an afterward, written in early 2005, summarizing the voters' response to the electric 2004 election, and defining the battle lines within the GOP between traditional conservatives and neoconservatives, the fighting between which began almost as soon as the 2004 returns were in",

And yet, every time I see a book by John Grisham in Hangzhou, I think, \"I don't have to finish reading it if I don't like it.\" I think of his value as trade bait, since he's so popular. And yet, I have never put aside a John Grisham book unread. What more does he have to do? Become less popular?     The premise on the back cover is simple enough. A homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage, somebody dies, and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience. You have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea. I've read almost everything Grisham has written, and I can remember most of it, and I'd have to put this at the top of the list. He's a master of character, plotting, simplifying the complex, setting, words, and accessibility. The writer should do all the work so the reader doesn't have to.     John Grisham, folks.

And they're turning up dead, and noone seems to know anything.  According to the feedback he's getting, these girls would never have willingly left their homes with anyone.  He's hitting a wall, and more girls are going missing...His home life is quickly spiralling out of his control, too...his 17 year old son is suddenly flunking classes in school, sullen and sneaky...his youngest son, who was kidnapped in a previous book, still won't sleep in his own bed and is just getting so he'll allow himself to be touched again...and Steven's Aunt is determined to fix him up with a woman.  In the midst of all this, Steven meets Jenna Marshall.  Dr. Jenna Marshall, actually~~his 17 yr. old son's Chemistry teacher, who is very concerned with Brads decline in grades and attitude.  The attraction is mutual, and immediate.  But how will Steven find the time for this when his plate is already full?  This is an awesome story, and if you're a romance fan, or a fan of suspense, don't miss it!!  It's loosely connected to Karen's other books, but every one is stand alone and not to be missed.

A more appropriate title for this book would have been: \"Transformed Away From The Truth...The Liberalization of the Worldwide Church of God; The Remarkable Story Of A Church's Journey From the Religion OF Jesus to a Religion ABOUT Jesus\".    Love him or hate him...the lectures, broadcasts, published books and magazine articles of Herbert W. Armstrong brought many thousands of people all over the world to the knowledge and acceptance of Jesus Christ as personal saviour...many of whom had never even considered attending a church before!   This was no pop culture 'plastic Jesus', but the Christ of the Bible...whose actual teachings would still be much in disfavor in today's supposedly 'enlightened' Evangelical world.  Yet, the author of this book vainly tries to insist that the Worldwide Church of God under the direction of Armstrong was more hung up on the 'Law of Moses' and the 7th Day Sabbath, rather than the \"grace\" of Jesus...and thus relegated Him (Jesus) to background status behind God the Father, and Bible Prophecy.     In 1976 the WCG published perhaps the best book written to date about the life, person and teachings of Jesus Christ, \"The Real Jesus\" by Garner Ted Armstrong who, at the time was a high ranking Minister in the denomination.   This, along with all the other Christocentric books and articles published by Armstrong over the decades since 1927, are all strangely ignored...as if Armstrong himself, never gave Christ as much as a passing thought!   Joseph Tkach Jr. goes on to largely bear 'false witness,' as it were, against the Church; its teachings; its mission; and its founder and late Pastor General H.W. Armstrong. He takes Armstrong to task over having the audacity to actually think that God would use him, to start a new era in the chronology of Church history....yet he himself mulls over the same thing, in his own role in the destruction of the denomination, which ironically he sees as a new beginning 'under grace'...whatever that means, since he's gone on to disfellowship entire congregations in various parts of the country...for continuing on in the traditional faith and worship practices, and for refusing to adopt his new 'tupperware party' style of pop-worship service.    About the most interesting thing in the book, were the charts tracing all the breakaway conferences, or 'splinter groups' as he calls them...however, the biggest irony is that the largest breakaway group, \"United Church of God\" now has more members than the WCG under the Tkach regime!   Another shortcoming of the book is the total lack of comment on, or concern for the victims of the Church's meltdown; the divided families; the fired long-time Ministers and other employees, and the total disruption of the Colleges. Perhaps the Church's new leaders need to write and sell books to make an income; since over 100,000 members picked up and left the organization since Tkach and Feazell took over the reins. Make no mistake about it...he (Tkach) has his fans, who view him as a 'liberator', while his detractors suspiciously view him as the possible end-time 'Man of Sin sitting in the seat of Moses', mentioned in Revelation!  Christ did say \"Ye will know them by their fruits...\" Thus far the fruits of Tkach's leadership have resulted in a bitter harvest",

Is it a sci-fi tale about the end of the world, black comedy, novel of inner pilgrimage, or a southern small-town novel like To Kill a Mockingbird?  All of these, and none, quite.  You can catch snippetts of the plot and setting from other reviewers.  But trying to squeeze this weird, topsy-turvy, yet familiar world into a few words is like trying to put the bubble bath back in the bottle.  Ideas and images float up in flurries.       Or maybe we should define Love in the Ruins by its characters?  Each is as brilliantly drawn as a blade of grass in the first bright rays of morning.  Not all are mad, in the conventional sense, though Thomas More, the drunken, philandering, brilliant, pious hero, who somewhat resembles the author, sometimes is.  \"Dear God, let me out of here, back to the nuthouse where I can stay sane.  Things are too naked out here.  People look and talk and smile and are nice and the abyss yawns.  The niceness is terrifying.\"  Percy also offers three lovely leading ladies, a tribe of black revolutionaries, \"love\" scientists, \"Knotheads,\" a \"scoffing Irish behaviorist, in whom irony is so piled up on irony, jokes so encrusted on jokes, winks and nudges and in-jokes so convoluted\" that he has turned orthodox, and a pretty spooky Satan in flannel.         Maybe the best way to introduce this book, aside from saying that it often made me laugh outloud, and often made me think, is to quote a few more lines.  If you like the taste, want to sup more on the strangeness of life (the quality by which reality so often surpasses mere novels), you'll probably want to read the book.       (1) \"Max the unbeliever, a lapsed Jew, believes in the orderliness of creation, acts on it with energy and charity.  I, the believer, having swallowed the whole Thing, God Jews Christ Church, find the world a mad-house and a madhouse home.  Max the atheist sees things like Saint Thomas Aquinas, ranged, orderly, connected up.\"    (2)  \"Ethel's car is both Japanese and Presbyterian, thrifty, tidy, efficient, chaste.\"    (3) \"The terror comes from piteousness, from good gone wrong and not knowing it, from Southern sweetness and cruelty . . . In Louisianna people still stop and help strangers.  Better to live in New York where life is simple, every man's your enemy, and you walk with your eyes straight ahead.",

Actually, this book is for anyone thinking  about any form of adoption because it has a great and succinct  discussion and comparison of all forms of adoption.  Although the book  goes on to a thorough coverage of international adoption, Davenport is  clear that all forms of adoption should be considered and there is no  one type of adoption that is best for everyone.    I love Davenport's thoroughness and her compassion for parents and  kids.  The book covers everything a prospective parent needs to think  about, but Davenport is nonjudgmental about many of the choices parent  will have to make.  With each choice she urges parents to be honest  with themselves and to put the interest of the child first.    Because we are at the beginning stages of considering adoption, I  found the first couple of chapters most helpful: are we ready to move  on to adoption, what type of adoption is best for us, how to choose a  country, and how to choose an agency.  I especially loved the chapter  on choosing a country and the charts at the back of the book on each  of the top 17 (?) placing countries.  Davenport has a website  [...] that keeps these charts up to date.    Regardless of which type of adoption we choose, I know that I will use  the rest of the book as a reference, especially if we decide on  international adoption.  Davenport takes your hand and walks you  through absolutely every experience you may have from finding the  money, to surviving the homestudy, to preparing the paperwork, to  waiting for your child, to traveling to meet your child, to the first  days together, to the first year home.  I liked her lists of questions  to ask agencies, references, your child's caregiver, etc.  I also  loved her section on attachment and how to help foster it.  She  explained it in a way that I understood and left me feeling hopeful,  not scared.    The Complete Book of International Adoption is a gem and a must for  any parent thinking about adoption",

It's Pratchett, you want to read it, the only reason you've been hesitating is because it's marked as a kids book (juvenile, young adult...) But this one isn't just for kids. As with any Pratchett book, there are layers and layers, and some of them wouldn't be obvious to kids at all.    For example, kids who have only seen the Batman movies, and not the original TV show, will miss it entirely when Mrs. Tachyon is saying \"dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner...\" and continues a few more times between interruptions, finally ending with \"dinner, dinner, Batman!\" which is where adults (at least my generation) will realize she's not saying dinner, she's humming the theme song. Also, kids the age of our protagonists, 13 or so, may not recognize the \"red shift\" when they get to it; that's usually covered a bit later in the science curriculum, such as college physics.    The protagonists are Johnny, and his friends Wobbler (who wobbles), Bigmac (who is large), and Yo-less, who is apparently the only black in Blackbury who doesn't say yo. They are joined in this book by Kirsty/Kasandra (she changes her name each week), who is hyper-intelligent and socially even more inept than the others. Each of this team has his own strange store of skills or knowledge. These talents turn out to have entirely different implications when travelling in time than they do in their own time. Bigmac's car-stealing abilities (which some parents may object to in a kids' book) turn out to be impaired when trying to steal a car that doesn't have power steering and power brakes. On the other hand, Yo-less's lack of cool is suddenly changed when he puts on period clothing and suddenly looks, as Johnny says, as though he plays the saxophone in a band. Yo-less does, though get exposed to the more primitive social prejudices of 1941, as does Kasandra. And Bigmac finds out that the skinhead symbols and attitudes that he wears only as a social item suddenly have real meaning, and it's not pleasant. OK, there's a bit of a moral or two snuck in here, about thinking about what things mean. There is also at least one moral that readers one and all will ignore, just as the characters do, about following advice (and about giving it).     Johnny has been working on his World War II project for school since the previous book, \"Johnny and the Dead.\" One of the funny bits in the book is how, whenever a kid claims he's doing \"a project,\" he winds up with all sorts of information that is unsuitable for kids, and/or hitherto classified or secret; the remembered horror of school projects makes all the adults give in so that they don't have to think about it any more!    Other reviewers have described much of the plot, so I won't repeat it here. One thing that some readers may wish to note about this plot is that it isn't just time travel, it's alternate history as well, and for kids this may serve as an introduction to the whole sub-genre of alternate history. Meanwhile, some of the high points:  * Mrs. Tachyon's cat, Guilty - and his tastes in food.  * The ice that forms on the characters during their last-minute rush for the air-raid siren.  * The importance of pickles.    The series has no noticeable sexual content, and no real bad language; the most dangerous things in it for young readers are the ideas, which may make them *gasp* think! It may also make them lifelong Pratchett addicts. In the opinion of an existing Pratchett addict, there's nothing at all wrong with that",

The adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story.  Actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles, but for an American reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary.    Much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor, the earl's mother, Edith herself, and a host of other characters.

I've traditionally been a supporter of the Republicans and the Patriot act but the Judge's book have made me rethink the Patriot Act.  I was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go, some dating back to Hamilton and Jefferson themselves",

If we indeed have a Shepherd, why isn't He doing a better job?  To this question, Kushner says, \"the psalmist would teach us to see the world, without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen, but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy This is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom.    Drawing on the individual lines of the Twenty-Third Psalm, Rabbi Kushner (known best for his book Why Bad Things Happen to Good People) creates 15 essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring. He outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm, noting \"The earliest ancestors of the Hebrew People who gave us the Bible were nomads, owning no property, bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on.\" The analogy of God to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment. The beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today. The image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge.  ed by the things that do happen.\"    Kushner is skilled at relating Biblical literature to questions and concerns of today.  He relates the verse to terrorists, Einstein and daily living. He provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively.  His words also provide hope to all of us:    \"You may have to work hard to earn your living...But you don't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself.  All you have to do is stop striving, relax, and say to yourself, I feel good about who I am.\"    This slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come.  It's a book I will come back to again and again for wisdom, courage and peace",

This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets",

Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).      Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of \"references\" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.      I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: \"With great power comes great responsibility.\"  But in this case it would seem: \"With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.",

Doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together. In a way he is a ridiculous Don Quixote, undaunted by reality, pining over a lost cause. Somehow this bizarre little man hopes on. No, he doesn't hope. He insists. He becomes president of the local shipping company, he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind, his love of the arts mirrors his love for her. Why does this work? Marquez is just a genius. He simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words. And so they come to life",

However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.    Hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.  He seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  He has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  Hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  I hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the world",

Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is.

People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is.

            "input": "Author devoid of the Holy Spirit, and ignorant of Holy Scriptures . Author displays his ignorance of the Holy Scriptures through out his book. Let me just highlight three areas.    (1) He quotes 1 Timothy 2:9-15 and then makes the following blasphemous statement,   \" Furthermore, they (woman) are held responsible for the origin of sin in the world: It was the woman who was deceived, not the man. \"  How spiritually blind one can get?     Let me elaborate. Apostle Paul in his letter to the church at Rome writes:    Romans 5:12  \"Just as sin entered into the world by one man, and death by means of sin, so death was imposed upon all men, in asmuch as they all have sinned.\"    Holy Spirit is holding Adam responsible for the entry of sin into the world. Yes Eve was deceived first by that serpent of old, called the Devil. Adam was not deceived, but disobeyed deliberately. Adam was the door through whom sin entered the world. Sin was the door through which death entered the world. I strongly feel that the words spoken by my Savior, Lord Eshoo Messiah (Aramaic for Jesus Christ) to Nichodemus in John 3:10 are applicable to Marcus Borg also.    John 3:10    Eshoo answered, You are a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not undertsnad these things.?    (2) Author writes:   \" I see the Bible as human response to God. Rather than seeing God as Scriptures's ultimate author.... the Bible thus tells us about how they saw things, not about how God sees things.\" This is blasphemy.     Holy Scriptures consisting of (Law of Moshey, Prophets, Psalms, four Gospels, Book of the Acts of the Apostles, 14 Epistles of Apostle Paul, one Epistle of James, two Epistles of Peters, three Epistles of John, one Epistle of Jude, and the Lord Eshoo Messiah's revelation to John) are Living WORD of God spoken by His prophets and Apostles through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. If God had not revealed Himself, we will still be speculating because we are fallen and fallible creatures. I thank the Lord that He took initiative and revealed Himself.    Apostle Peter writes:     \"We have also a TRUE WORD of prophesy; you do well when you look to it for guidance, as you look to the lamp that shines in a dark place until the dawn of day, when the sun will shine in your hearts.\"    God with wisdom created the heaven and earth in the very beginning. Book of Proverbs was written so that we may know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; to receive discipline, reverence, righteousness, and justice, and equity.It says the following about God's word:    Proverbs 8:8-9    \"All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing perverse or deceptive in them. They are all plain to him who understands them, and right to those who are willing to find knowledge.\"    Author ignored the words of the Holy Spirit spoken through King Solomon, Son of David, wherein he writes:     \"If you will turn to my reproof, behold, I will pour out My Spirit upon you; I will make known My words to you(Proverbs 1:23.)\"     In my view, author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise, he became fool (Romans 1:22.).     (3)Let me illustrate author's foolishness with another blasphemy. He writes:     \" But a moment's reflection suggests that the Ten Commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view.\". I wonder if he has ever studied the book of Pslams. Let me just quote Psalm 19 where law is called Law of the LORD.    Psalm 19:7-11    \"The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the young men. The statues of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The reverence of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgment of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. They are more to be coveted than gold; yea, than precious stones; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them Thy servant is warned; and if he keep them he shall be greatly rewarded.\"    Book of Revelation says that:    \"This is the perseverence of saints that they keep the commandment of God and their testimony of Eshoo Messiah, who is King of kings, LORD of lords.\"    Apostle Peter 2000 years ago had warned us of such self appointed professors when he writes:    2 Peter 3:16  \"..... In Paul's epistles there are certain things so hard to be understood that those who are ignorant and unstable pervert their meanings, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction\".    Holy Spirit calls such authors as \"springs without water, cloud that are carried away with a tempest; the mist of darkness is reserved for them forever.....\". \"Verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them.\"    Author's contempt for the Holy Scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the Lutheran church. He says: \"I was nurtured in the the Lutheran church and remained Lutheran until about age 30.\"    Luther is not much of a roll model for anything. It is Luther who showed contempt for the Holy Scriptures when he called book of James, \" an epistle of straw\". Luther called book of Revelation, \"worthless\". Talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude. Lord Eshoo Messiah said \"unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of God\". By that, my Savior did not mean at all that we should be childish. What he talks about is having child like trust.     Book of Psalms tells that \"He teaches humble His way\".     And \"fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction.\"     To such self appointed reformers and professors, Holy Spirit had issued following warning in the Epistle of James:    James 3:1  \"Let not many of you become teachers,my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.\"    Luther should have kept himself busy studying God's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe, \" Jews and their lies\". This book came in very handy for Hitler who sent 6 millions of the seed of Abraham( Jews) to their death in holocaust - pan European event. 6th commandment, which is Law of God says: \"Thou shall not kill or murder\"     Holy Scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely. Neither Luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching. I am convinced that there was no reformation. Things have not changed at all. In Rome we have one Pope on seven hills. Protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill(western and eastern churches).    Lord Eshoo during His earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals, but instead said:    \" Because of the growh of iniquity (lawlessness) love of many will grow cold. Will Son of Man find faith when He returns?\"    I want to cry out: Help Lord, godly men ceases to be, and faith has disappeared from the earth\"    Let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the Holy Spirit:    Proverbs 30: 5-6    \"Every word of God is pure; He is a shiled to those who put their trust in Him.  Do not add to His words; lest He reprove you, and you be found a liar.\"    He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

With one or two exceptions, it concerns women confronting decisions - from the most mundane to the fairly serious.

At times the reader may find the direction taken by the author to be controversial, even uncomfortable. I know I asked myself during several stories, \"Now why the heck would she do that?\" I suspect that was the point being made by the author and what is the ultimate joy of the book - to force the reader to accept each character as independent of any predispositions by the reader.    The author uses sarcasm and more conventional humor where the average reader is least likely to expect it. She takes simple stories and sends them in unexpected directions. My favorite story in the collection was \"I Thought You Said You Love Me\", perhaps because it was the most conventional. That said, \"Model Job\" was just as enjoyable, but most unconventional.

There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's \"The Journey\" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as \"lugubrious.\") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed \"it.\" But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's \"Louis and Antoinette.\" As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English",

In this collection of 14 short stories by everyone's favorite boogeyman Stephen King, there is a one particular story in here called \"1408\" that is in my honest opinion, the scariest short story that King has published to date. It deals with a haunted hotel room and I'm not telling you anymore than that. What I will say is that I've read this one story at least ten times and it never fails to make the hairs on my neck stand straight up.     If you, dear Amazon shopper, like the feeling of being terrified this is what I suggest:    Get your hands on a copy of this book.  When you've done that, make sure you save \"1408\" for a night that you're alone. Try to read this one when you're nice and relaxed and really try to let yourself get immersed in King's masterful storytelling. I guarantee that at least nine out of ten of you that follow my suggestions will get spooked something awful.    As for the rest of the book, it really is a return to form for King as far as his short story collections go (\"Nightmares and Dreamscapes\", the book and not the TNT series, wasn't all that great save for a couple). Most of the stories here are hits rather than misses and \"1408\" isn't the only story here that will give you the chills. \"The Man in the Black Suit\" is pretty intense (not to mention King won an O. Henry Award for that one). \"Riding the Bullet\", the famed e-book from a few years back is here also, as well as a nice little side tale from the Dark Tower series titled \"The Little Sisters of Eleuria\".

Written by the same author as Cults, New Religions Movements, and Your Family, as well as Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions, gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious \"history\" of the Church.  Although not an actual history of Mormonism, but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the Church, (its people, dealings and influences) the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire 170 year span of its existence.  Yes, the volume is anti-Mormon, it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint.  Abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti-Mormon writers (confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution, using enflamed and unreliable anti-Mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti-Mormon arguments that have been dealt-with in scholarly journals and balanced histories) yes, he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the Tanner's as an authoritative source, and yes, the author has no clue what historical perspective is, but, one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work.  He not only covers all the standard anti-Mormon fare (the Danites, blood atonement, polygamy, money digging, etc.); but current subjects as well (including the Osmond's, Steve Benson, the 2002 Olympics, Paul Dunn, Thomas Ferguson, and racism).  I enjoyed the author's journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub-chapter headings as well (i.e., \"Bloody Brigham,\" \"Big Trouble in Little Missouri,\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Thinking is a Sin\").  I like that Abanes uses the internet and listed URL's for reference and resource, I liked his use of charts (First Vision, Book of Mormon, failed prophecies), and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well-known publisher, it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the Avalon Publishing Group.  Although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on Mormonism, the author does show that the Church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past, its \"official\" vs. its \"actual\" history, and currently about its political activities, treatment of its \"academic\" members (versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members (including general authorities) as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing-off of its records and library.  The volume has 436 pages of text, five appendices (one containing a helpful glossary of \"Mormon terms\"), 152 pages of notes, a small bibliography and a 22 page index",

Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.    The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.    One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.    All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.     The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.    The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it",

Harold Bloom, borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis, interprets the poet's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic Oedipal struggle, arguing that the (\"belated\") poet's literary productions result from a conflict with a \"strong\" father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the \"repression\" of his own poetic self and the strong misreading (or \"misprision\", as Bloom calls it) of the work of a predecessor. Bloom's conception of the \"canon\" is a hierarchical, continuous and genealogical model of direct succession, as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities, ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency, opening his text to the strong aura of the canon, and testing his productions against it. However, Bloom's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence, belatedness and originality, and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously. This admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial. Another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of &quot;influence&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness, for the poet cannot be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching. Bloom's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents, and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works, reflects the postmodern &quot;fin-de-millennium&quot; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted, and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works, but merely repeat the past. Not only are his conclusions totally untenable, but his whole treatise, on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents, fails to provide for a more dynamic, more forward-moving (as opposed to reversing, revising and troping) theory of poetry, a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully. It would be interesting to discover what Bloom would make of Henry Adams's remark: \"Everything is respectable and nothing amusing. There are no outlaws.",

Reading it made me more fully appreciate her autobiography \"Story of a Soul.\"  Each chapter of the book comprises different topics that she addressed in her writings, and serves well as a meditation. I think the author states that it is his intent to provide the reader with a personal retreat based on the teachings of Therese. I read one chapter a night before I went to bed.      Therese of Lisieux's approach to spirituality is accessible to any one in any walk of life. She describes souls as similar to different types of flowers. Some are roses, others lilies, and some like orchids, for example. And all can be equally pleasing to God in their own way, when seeking his role for them. People have different talents and different struggles, but these characteristics do not mean that any type is more valued than the other.      The chapters are divided according to topics that address needs of everyone; regardless of what type of flower they are. The topics are drawn from examples of Therese's life and writings, but the author also includes many biblical quotes and some writings of other Christians, such as Teresa of Avila, that support the advice given.     It is fitting that the first chapter describes love, as Therese sated that is the Church is one body, then she want to be its heart, that loves every one, because God is love. The chapter instructs how to demonstrate love to God and others through all actions of our lives, regardless of our station or ability. The chapter \"Fraternal Charity\" speaks in greater details about relations with others and how to fulfill our duties towards them    The chapter \"Unshakeable Confidence\" outlines advice for people who experience spiritual dryness. It amazed me to learn that Therese of Lisieux experiences dryness, and helps console me when I feel similarly, because if some one who lived as holy a life as she did suffered from this problem, than I should not feel disillusioned from the experience.    \"Humble Confidence\" is a chapter that provides sound guidance for acting in faith. It seems that there is a fine line between being confident in religion and proud, the latter of which is not a virtue.       \"Abandonment to Jesus\" and \"The Cross\" are helpful chapters for people experiencing difficult times, and anxiety about the future; whether it is the daily grind that is wearing one down, or a specific setback.  And Catholic may benefit particularly from the chapter on the \"Eucharist,\" as the late Pope has named this year the \"Year of the Eucharist.\"    The book is easy to read and personal. The organization of the chapters, are useful for providing support to people during different struggles. I read the book through once, and return to different sections, depending on my needs, but each chapter is a complete meditation in itself and the book can be skipped around. Each reading makes me appreciate them more.",

            "input": "THE Book on Christian Ethics . This book is, I am convinced the best overall introduction to Christian ethics and the thought of Stanley Hauerwas.  Hauerwas has certainly written many wonderful books, but this one stands out in that it encapsulates a fairly coherent and articulate manner, his conception of what Christian ethics is and how they are lived out in the life of the church.    Hauerwas first offers a critique of ethics that would have pretentions to a universal status.  The way he states this is that all ethics require a qualifier ('Christian', 'Jewish', 'Hindu', etc.).  Every concievable ethic is grounded in a tradition and a narrative that gives substance to the ethical claims.  Thus, even though Christians believe that Christianity is true and Christian ethics are the right way for all people to live, this reality cannot be known without becoming a Christian, thereby making the stories of Israel and Jesus your story.  Thus, Christian ethics are not universal in the sense that they can be percieved as correct by anybody.  Rather to understand Christian ethics as true, one must be transformed through participation in Christ through the church.  This, of course grounds Hauerwas's claim that the church as a concrete community is the locus of Christian ethical reflection.    Obviously, the major theme of this book is nonviolence.  Hauerwas grounds this approach solidly on the narrative of the cross and resurrection of Christ which he holds to be decisive for the content of Christian claims about the world and life in it.  Over-against those who advocate an ethic of justifiable violence, Hauerwas contends that Christian ethics must be informed by the Biblical narrative of Christ, who won God's victory precisly through rejecting violence and inaugurating God's kingdom of justice and peace which the church is called to embody.  Hauerwas's ethic, contra Ramsey, Gustafson, Niebhur, Neuhaus, Stackhouse, Novak and others argues that Christ's teaching, life, death and resurrection should be decisive for our ethics, rather than dismissed as irrelevant.  In much of this Hauerwas draws on the excellent work of John Howard Yoder in \"The Politics of Jesus\" and \"The Original Revolution.\"    This is a vitally important book, even for those who disagree with Hauerwas's Christ-centered, ecclesial ethic.  He very clearly shows in this book how his ethic takes into account the importance of deicisions and cooperating with non-Christians in the interest of social justice, issues that his critics often ignore in their overblown critques of his work.  This is a vital book for Christian theologians, ethicists and the all Christians who desire to take the gospel seriously.  Highly recommended",

He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution.  He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well.  Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement.  Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics.  He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.  Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks.  At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic.  Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion.  Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans.    None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla.    The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts.  He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates.    He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said \"Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being \"simply waste and destruction\"\".    He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact \"the devil\" as the neo-cons believe he is.  Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said.    From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states \"I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction.\"    Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States.    If you are a confederate \"lost causer\" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book.    William Hal",

            "input": "Informative but poorly organized and biased . Albert Hourani's A History of the Arab Peoples is a widely regarded general history of the Arab world. This is too bad, since as history the book is of low quality, with significant problems of organization and, where relevant to Hourani's apparent biases, factual accuracy. It does have its redeeming elements, but on the whole is for a variety of reasons not a reliable source as a general history of the Arab world, especially for the beginner.    Being the author of a general history of the Arab world myself, before I explain why I evaluate the book negatively I would like to suggest some alternatives, lest I be accused of attacking a rival publication out of self-interest. Philip K. Hitti's The History of the Arabs is a very detailed history which runs from pre-Islamic times to the 19th century. Arthur Goldschmidt's Concise History of the Middle East covers Turkey, Iran and Israel as well as the Arab world and is well-organized for beginners. It was the first general history of the Middle East I read as an undergraduate. Bernard Lewis' The Middle East focuses more on concepts and the flow of history but is also appropriate for those without a strong background in the region.    This book was first published in 1991. This review is based on the 1992 paperback version by Warner Books.    The initial weakness of this book begins with the very first chapter; although containing 458 pages of main text, Hourani's history devotes a mere seven pages to the pre-Islamic period. This is pretty amazing, for anyone familiar with that period, since Arab history prior to Islam is roughly as long as Arab history after it. Exactly how far back Arab peoples go in history is a matter of dispute, but certainly there were people one could call \"Arabians\" as far back as the beginning of the first mellinnium BC, or 1,600 years prior to Muhammad. The evidence is sporadic for sure, and no writer would give it equal prominence with later times, but seven pages is pretty paltry.    One might suspect an Islamic bias here, but the problem continues in the key early periods of Islam. The life of Muhammad and his immediate successors who established the basis for the Muslim world, spanning about a half century from Muhammad's first vision to the death of his son-in-law and successor Ali, get only 11 pages. The first Arab empire, the Umayyads (661-950), gets seven pages, and the Abbasid Empire (750-circa. 945), which is usually thought of as the \"Golden Age of Islam,\" gets only six. This means 37 pages for the first 2,000 years of Arab history, including its framing epoch, and over 400 pages for the next 1,000. This would leave the uninitiated reader entirely without much sense of proportion.    What makes this book highly unrecommended for the beginner is its weak sense of organization. The middle time period between the collapse of Abbasid authority - roughly AD 950 - and the ascendance of the Ottoman Empire over the Arab world in 1517 is intrinsically a difficult time period to understand and a more difficult one on which to write a history. This is due to the fact that rather than there being one dominant power or a few powerful states, there is instead a multiplicity of dynasties with genuine authority in some areas not extending beyond the town level with a multifarious mixture of Sunni and Shia, Arab, Persian and Turkic ruling groups, not to mention the Latin states. Hourani makes no serious attempt to help the reader keep all of it straight by moving from a chronological approach prior to 950 to a topical one. There are ten chapters covering this time period and the social history of part of the previous two periods (the Umayyads and the Abbasids). There is one chapter which discusses the major power struggles of the time. If you want to understand the relative historical roles of the Buyids, the Fatimids, the Zengids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and their contemporaries, read something else.    It is within these ten chapters that this book contains its major strength - its \"social history,\" or its description of the development of the Arab world. In fact I cited Hourani on the social history sections of my own book. In this regard, Hourani really is better than the alternatives. Over 200 pages of the book is devoted to detailing various aspects of how the Arab world came to be prior to the Ottomans. So for those who have already read a general history of the Middle East or the Arab world and want a more specialized knowledge, these chapters are quite useful.    I have several objections to how this book handles a variety of issues of current interest. This book was written during a time period when there was a great emphasis on negating certain negative images of Arabs and Muslims, to the point of deemphasizing any aspect of the Arab world which might be interpreted negatively. The word \"jihad\" doesn't even have an entry in the index, although it is used, or perhaps, misused. On page 247, Hourani describes a traditional view stipulating that the ruler has an obligation \"to pursue jihad by maintaining the strength of the kingdom's defense...\" This gives a misimpression, because legally jihad has two military meanings - the defense of Muslim lands and the Muslim community's collective obligation to spread Islam through conquest. Although jihad has a spiritual as well as martial application, its use is overwhelmingly in the military context, and while Muhammad's battles probably could be described as defensive, the vast majority of military actions between that time and the 19th century involved offensive operations (the Christian counter-offensives known as the Crusades being a major exception).    More broadly, the single most influential Islamist movement of the modern age, the Wahhabis, get only a few scattered mentions, and there is no real indication of the wave of extremism which by 1991 had been felt for some time. The primary non-Islamist ideological influence, Marxism, is discussed of course, but the influence of Nazism during the 1930s and 1940s is left out. Nazi Germany is mentioned once in passing, and in the same paragraph on page 331 Palestinian leader Amin Husseini is mentioned, but it isn't mentioned that he was a strong supporter of Nazis, that he moved to Germany during the Second World War and played an active role in the Holocaust, or that despite this he was made leader of the Palestinian cause by the nascent Arab League after the war.    Hourani's account of the 1967 is incredibly inaccurate, giving the impression that Egypt engaged in some bluster and then Israel started the war. He mentions Nasser's demand that the UN clear out of the Suez Canal zone, and includes the defense pact with Jordan, but omits a key fact - the mobilization of Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Once Egypt did this, Israel had no choice but to attack, because of its small population its economy could not handle an extended mobilization, while Egypt could. Hourani also doesn't mention the statements by Arab leaders to the effect that all Jews would be wiped out in the coming war.    On the whole, this is a useful book if one already has a framework understanding of Arab history and if one understands the slant that is being presented on issues of contemporary concern. Otherwise, I do not recommend buying it",

This is not only a story I \"get,\" (couple flees city for a life in the country) it's full of a self-deprecating and sarcastic wit I welcome when reading memoirs.    Jim Mullen, a humor columnist best known for his \"Hot Sheet\" in Entertainment Weekly, portrays Manhattan life as addiction. Addiction, for example, to non-stop action, Broadway plays, gallery openings, ethnic restaurants and The New York Times. The symptoms include immunity to noise and smells, and they lead to chain-smoking and excessive spending at The Sharper Image. He's hooked. It's his wife, Sue, who takes the lead and buys a farm three hours northwest of the city in the Catskills, and drags him along for what turn out to be rehabilitative weekends. As the weekends grow from two days to five and then finally full time, he gives up smoking, takes up bicycling and then learns about everything from growing giant pumpkins to the inner workings of a septic system. One realizes he has come full circle when he describes a dewy spider web as the prettiest thing he's ever seen and recognizes a \"flatlander\" in the garden store. While observing this newer version of the village idiot, he rolls his eyes and wonders if that's how he was when he first entered (the fictional town of) Walleye.    The writing is original and funny, informal without being glib, irreverent without being vulgar. For anyone who enjoys well-written memoirs--particularly those of the city-mouse, country mouse variety--put this on your list. Also recommend: \"Fifty Acres and a Poodle.\"    From the author of \"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\" and \"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\" McKenna Publishing Group.",

Kenny has no recollection of what happened while the murder took place, just like one of Andy's prior clients (remember \"Open and Shut\").

You need to wait till almost the end of the book to find out the outcome (unless you already had a sneak peak into the author's next book).    Though the book is better than a lot of courtroom thrillers out there it is slow the first 150-200 pages (the book is only about 300 pages) and Andy seems to not be as sharp witted and interesting as he was in the author's prior works.  Also, the author tries to fake out the reader twice with resolutions but both times there are still a lot of pages to go and so unresolved fine details (reminiscent of the movie \"Taking Lives\") that the reader is far from fooled.

Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.

We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?      The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.     And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.     Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public",

Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed.  Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception.  Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters.  Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth.  Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had.  This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations.  Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction.  Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery",

I have read other works positing a connection between physical symptoms/illnesses and life trauma; the idea is not unique or new.  Alice Miller is fixated on the idea that the Fouth Commandment (honor thy parents) has poisoned lives and ruined society and restates this theory every page or two.  This notion is so compelling to her that she actually went to the Vatican to complain.  Ms. Miller gives anecdotal information about famous people who died young and then leaps to the conclusion that their parents were mean to them.  Maybe they were -- but what are we supposed to do with this information?  Find a therapist who is willing to become emotionally involved with us seems to be the cure.  This medicine carries its own risks.  I'm sorry Alice was also raised by abusers (which she confesses) but getting tangled up in some codependent parent-figure therapeutic emotional incest with her or someone like her is not really going to help anybody.  Realizing what happened to you is important, and raging and grieving about it is important, but sooner or later you have to move on.  Forgiving isn't forgetting or letting the abuser off the hook -- it's letting YOU off the hook, refusing to be owned by the past anymore.  And yes, you can love and hate somebody at the same time.    It gets down to knowing you can't get what you needed from them or any other person in your adult life...YOU have to become the parent of the wounded child within and HELP THAT CHILD FINISH GROWING UP.

The cat, a mean old Tom who scratches everyone except for Sir George has been missing for two days putting his master in a fouler mood than usual.  Sir George wakes up quickly when he hears Samson outside and goes to find him.  Someone smashes him on his head killing him.    Since Sir George was the cousin of Queen Victoria, his case is very high profile so Scotland Yard assigns it to Inspector Gerald Witherspoon who has a phenomenal successor rate in solving homicides.  Neither Witherspoon nor his supervisors know that his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the other servants of his house work behind the scenes to help their master solve his cases.  This inquiry is harder than most as everyone has a motive for killing the baronet, including his three daughters, his ex-lover, the gardener the housekeeper, and trades people he cheated out of money.    This is one historical mystery series that never gets boring or dull.  The author keeps the series fresh by making each homicide case original.  Lovers of late Victorian mysteries will thoroughly enjoy this tale because Inspector Witherspoon comes across as so innocent and naïve that readers will adore him.

The BFG is a children's book written by Roald Dahl, who wrote such classics as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach, and illustrated by Quentin Blake. The book was published in 1982 and immediately became popular amongst children and adults. The book won the Federation of Children's Book Groups Award in 1982 (UK), and was named one of the \"best books of the past 20 years\" by the UK's Good Book Guide in 1997.    The story is about an orphan girl named Sophie who, one night when she can't sleep, looks out her window to see a creepy looking giant blowing something into the windows where other children sleep. When the giant looks her right in the eye, Sophie jumps to her bed, and hides under her blanket only to be snatched by the giant and taken away to his home. It turns out that the scary giant is none other than the BFG, or the Big Friendly Giant, the only giant amongst the frightening human-eating giants who is a good giant, who satisfies his hunger on weird vegetables known as the snozzcumbers and drinks a delicious fizzy drink known as the frobscottle, which has bubbles that travel downwards that makes the drinker break wind instead of burp. The other giants are named The Fleshlumpeater, The Bonecruncher, The Manhugger, The Childchewer, The Meatdripper, The Gizzardgulper, The Maidmasher, The Bloodbottler, and The Butcher Boy. When Sophie asks the BFG about what he does at night, he reveals his secret of blowing bottled dreams, nice dreams, into the windows of children's bedrooms, something the other giants have no knowledge of.  When he catches a nightmare, he destroys it so that nobody will ever have to experience it. Sophie and the BFG become friends, and team up to rid the Giant Country and the world from the evil giants. So, the BFG mixes a dream showing what the giants do, which in turn becomes the worst nightmare the BFG had ever encountered, and takes it to Buckingham Palace and blows it into the Queen's bedroom, and leaves Sophie on the windowsill, for the dream includes the knowledge that she would be there when the Queen wakes up. When the Queen awakens after the frightful dream, she believes Sophie's story, speaks to the BFG, and works along with Sophie and the BFG to eliminate the child-eating giants.    The BFG is a character that the reader will automaticaly like. His unusual features, and nonsensical vocabulary, are both funny and very appealing to children as well as adults. Sophie is the young orphan girl who does an outstanding thing (saving the world from the evil giants), a theme that had been used by Dahl in other books like Matilda.     The book was very easy to read, and extremely amusing. Dahl's style and imaginative BFG dialogue tends to make children laugh and attempt to imitate. The story may also give the children a sense of fear or suspense (the description of the evil giants and what they do). Of course, the best thing about The BFG is the theme of good versus evil. It also shows that not just because someone might look unusual or scary means that that someone or thing is evil. In other words, you can't judge others by what they look like or how they look, but you can judge them only by their actions; a very useful lesson of life for children.    IMPORTANT NOTE: Some elements in the book may be offensive to some ethnic readers (Greeks, Turks amongst others).    Recommended",

            "input": "Too Liberal . The authors cover many of the events that occurred during the timeframe so I believe you can get some decent background info from the book.  However, it is very political and seems to blame the country for not adopting a  social welfare state much sooner.  In many areas, it is too superficial and  quickly concludes &quot;where was a government program to cure these ills  of history&quot; and doesn't really explore the causes of problems.  Case  in point, American farmers fed the world during WW-1 as European  agriculture was in shambles.  That allowed American farmers to enjoy strong  prices and high incomes in the war years.  But in the 1920s, the European  farmers were back and the market suffered from classic oversupply and farm  incomes declined.  The authors don't report that or even classify the war  years as an anomoly for farmers.  Instead, they focus on the unfairness  that the farmers didn't participate to the same degree in the prosperity of  the 1920s.  The tone gets very upset with thoughts that the federal  government should have prevented this like our wonderful never-ending farm  programs of today that have us subsidizing the growth of tobacco and mohair  wool. In other areas, the book is wrong.  For example, it traces the  formation of the Federal Reserve System to JP Morgan's inability to stem  the bank failures and outflow of gold in the Panic of 1907.  Actually,  Morgan was very successful in rescuing the powerless federal government and  raising gold in Europe to prop up our banks.  The Federal Reserve System  arose as the government was worried about having one private man being able  to wield so much financial power. All in all, the historical background is  there and is a good primer, but be prepared to listen to a lecture of what  is fair and right and what is not",

What we actually have is a Christian Theologian basically answering Dawkins with 'Not in MY religion.' It is a defense of his own personal Christian beliefs and there is virtually no mention of other religions nor recognition of differences within Christianity itself.     McGrath makes an argument that we can only be agnostic yet only applies this to atheists and clearly not to himself and other Christians. He does not say what he believes about the many other gods and spirits etc humans believe or believed in though it is only possible to conclude that he must be an atheist where they are concerned.    There is a valid point he makes about the correlation between religious belief and health and well-being but this does not mean that religious belief is the cause of the health. If religious belief caused good health and well-being then, as the vast majority of people who have ever lived have had one religious belief or another, we would expect the world have always been overflowing with health etc. This is obvously not the case.    The only evidence offered for God is how nature makes us feel - nature being the pointer towards the beauty of God. He conveniently avoids telling us what parasites, diseases, predation, tsunamis etc etc tell us about God.     McGrath says that the question of God's existence is not a scientific question. 'It's more like the question of whether democracy is better than totalitarianism.' PRECISELY! Religions are the products of (almost exclusively) male minds. They are linked to self-interested tribal identity both to bond and identify 'us' and distinguish us from 'them'. And this is where Dawkins is lost on McGrath - Dawkins' writings undermine the very foundations for divisions and hierarchies not only of humans but of all life. Dawkins' frustration no doubt partly comes from the fact that evolved human tribalism is as ingrained as it so unfortunately is. McGrath himself knows and says that religious belief is about identity and status.    Finally, McGrath never touches on the most obvious point of religion - the promise of immortality. If this is not self-interested narcissism, a need to believe oneself so special that one cannot die and will reap great rewards in heaven, then I don't know what is. The dangers involved in this thinking are not addressed.    If McGrath truly believes we can all only be agnostic then he should be trying to persuade his fellow believers and not just atheists. If religious people worldwide adopted agnosticism it may dampen the flames of divisive, tribal religious fervor and increase general humility to everyone's benefit.    In the meantime I'm looking forward to reading Dawkins' 'The God Delusion'",

Even the avid \"trekie\" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying \"Beam me up, Scotty.\"  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide \"Rapture.\"  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.     The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.     In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.      Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's \"new evangelism\" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the \"Tribulation Force\" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.    They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.    The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.    I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the \"left behind\" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.    Thomas J. Hickey",

Andrew Solomon is a science writer who has taken the risky step of telling the vast, intriguing story of a deeply personal condition in the first person - which means that we follow him on an extraordinary roller coaster ride toward self discovery and healing (Solomon suffers very serious depression and tries all manner of \"cures\" including a death-wish desire to contract AIDS, and bizarre tribal rites in Africa) while also tracing the long tortuous history (and geography) of Depression as a subject. Our understanding of Depression, Solomon lucidly reveals, has been the subject of a centuries-long tug of war between two mindsets: those who see it as a chemical condition, and those who see it as a psychological (ie emotional) condition. As the history of civilisation veers between rational and romantic eras, so too has the understanding and treatment of Depression. Is it any wonder that a modern sufferer is torn between the talk-therapies and the chemical therapies such as Prozac?    Andrew Solomon comes down with an argument that both therapies are flipsides of the same whole - and that both have a role to play as sufferers seek escape from the bottomless black abyss. On the way he covers related subjects including Depression and suicide and Depression and creativity - and, this is the miracle of his writing and a tribute to his approach - the subject matter comes over as fascinating rather than gruelling.    If you are a sufferer, or live with one - or simply wish to know better how the human mind really works, this volume is pretty compelling. One of the best pieces of advice that Andrew Solomon cites is from a Greek philosopher who, more than 2000 years ago suggested that sufferers enjoy good wine and food, and surround themselves with good friends.

If there is one thing that rings true of the editor's review, it's that Robert Spencer is \"lawyerly\" - but not in the sense the editor meant, rather in the sense that he deliberately twists the facts in order to argue his case despite the facts.  This book is full of misquotations of the sayings of Muhammad (ahadith), and they are obviously deliberate as Mr. Spencer has taken the time to research the ahadith and yet still makes enormous errors in his rendering of them.  He spends a considerable amount of time quoting from the Bible and comparing his interpretation of the Christian doctrine (which I would guess a great many Christains will have issue with, as well) with what he claims to be the message of Islam.  He also spends a great deal of time attempting to assassinate the personality of Muhammad with the argument that Muhammad is the role model for all Muslims - hence by assasinating this personality he hopes to assasinate the character of Islam and all Muslims.  Despite his opening claim that he is not targeting all Muslims, the goal of his book, really, is to draw suspicion upon every Muslim in America from their non-Muslim neighbors.  His basic premise that Islam in essence is a falsehood and that all Muslims have deceived themselves with a backward and dated belief system that has failed to evolve, as he puts it, as Christianity has evolved from its backwardness by reducing the Bible to strictly metaphorical meanings.  The crux of his arguement is that Christianity is able to do this, because, as Christian scholars have shown, the Bible is in fact not the direct word of God,  but the Quran, on the other hand, is taken by Muslims as the direct, revealled word of God and hence there is little or no room for the religion to be re-interpreted.  If one reads (or listens, in the case of the audio book) carefully, though, it will not be hard to find the many instances in which Mr. Spencer contradcits himself.  All in all, it does read like a lawyer making his case in court, where it is Islam itself that is on trial.  Mr. Spencer seems to be trying to establish that the likes of Osama bin Laden are in fact   only following the letter of their religion, and hence Islam is a danger to be feared and reacted to preemtively.  Mr. Spencer seems to have strong political and religious motivations and is a far cry from his claim of being unbiased",

            "input": "Class Warfare Comes to the American Revolution? . Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, \"to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River.\" (Nash, xxviii)  Nash bemoans how the \"great men\" still \"dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]\" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with \"historical amnesia,\" (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the \"great men\" clique.  He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society.  These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population.      Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories.  To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament.  He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way.  In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City.  Led by Ethan Allen, the \"Green Mountain Boys,\" as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property.  (Nash, 110 - 114)  He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well.  (Nash, 73 - 79)  In the case of the \"Green Mountain Boys,\" their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon.    Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution.  In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era.  In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state.  He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution.  (Nash, 271 - 286)  In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook.  (Nash, 302 - 304)    The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies.  These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land.  This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59)  What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise.  (Nash, 37 - 39)  What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown.  (Nash, 157 - 164)  Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land.  Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves.  (Nash, 64)  He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland.  (Nash, 426 - 427)     Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict.  First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution.  Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective.  This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands.  If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation.  (Nash, 141 - 144)  Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities.  Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed.  In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices.  (Nash, 232 - 235)    The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations.  Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion.  (Nash, 151 - 157)  What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' \"genocidal\" policies towards the native population.  (Nash, 377 - 381)    Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution.  That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare.  There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters.  As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, \"The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government.\"  (Wood, 5)  Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along \"local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences.\"  These complexities made, \"any generalization about Americans as a whole,\" quite difficult.  (Wood, 6)    Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work.  Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the \"New Republic Online\":  Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution.  This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it.  Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument.  Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes.  The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare.  (Wood, \"New Republic Online Review)      Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated:  But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare?  There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes.  Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future.     In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom.  Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves.  Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to \"expose\" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their \"elitists\" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below.  There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people.  To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a \"tyranny of the masses\" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation.    However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points.  Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers.  Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case.  It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here.  What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell.  Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector.  To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era.  Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed?    Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries.  This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution.  When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to \"tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution.\"  (Nash, 367)  However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort.  Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan.  (Nash, 395)  If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it?  Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large.    Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the \"Newburgh Conspiracy.\"  It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities.  (Nash, 370 - 371)  However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy.  The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power.  Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again.    Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era.  He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously.  However, I would like to offer my own take on this.  Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation?  I certainly think not.  Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself.  In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life.  Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, \"You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!\"  (Douglass, 53)  While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind.    Nash lamented the \"genocidal policies\" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution.  While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history.  Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World.  In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable.  However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions.  Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force.       Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution.  (Nash, xv)  First, I would ask Mr. Nash, \"should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?\"  While historians do deal with the \"great men\" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below.  Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war.  We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise.  We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country.      What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution.  Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records.  Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences.  Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures.    Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored.  Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side.  Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers.    The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well.  Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution.  Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it.  Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution.    The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals.  Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict.  Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South.  Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion.    Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution.  The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few \"Founding Fathers,\" but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class.  Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in.    These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more.  These books are not hard to find.  Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields.

            "input": "Not quite what I was expecting . A Journey to the Center of the Earth did not turn out to be quite what I was expecting; I can't say quite why, however, because I'm not entirely certain what those expectations were.  I hadn't read the novel previously, but I thought I knew what it was about.  As a result, I think I was expecting more drama than Verne delivers, or perhaps I simply wanted the book to be more than it is.  Most likely I was conflating Verne's novel with other texts: movie adaptations of the novel itself, for instance, in which considerably more in the way of actual antagonism--as opposed to the perils of nature itself--occurs; or hollow world stories, in which entire societies thrive on the inside of the earth's crust beneath the rays of a sun that lies at the planet's center.  A Journey to the Center of the Earth is neither of these things, of course, and if I underwent any disillusionment, it was purely of my own making.    Understood on its own terms, the novel is, at the very least, interesting, but, truthfully, not much happens.  The narrator's speculations (as well as his fevered dreams during times of travail) suggest a much wilder adventure than actually takes place.  Much of the action involves the trio of explorers stumbling around in caverns and tunnels, and much of the impediment takes the form of hunger, dehydration, or equipment loss.  In fact, as best I can judge, they really don't approach anywhere near the center of the earth, although they do travel quite a distance laterally before resurfacing.    The real joy is the interactions between the characters, primarily the trio of protagonists: the young narrator, his scientist uncle, and their silent, idiosyncratic guide.  The expedition leader is an archetypal nutty professor, whose words and actions seem nonsensical to those not privy to his thought processes; his nephew, the narrator, alternates between sheer wonder at his surroundings, and sheer terror at the likelihood of spending the rest of his short life surrounded by them; Hans, the guide, says almost nothing but performs his duties in an exemplary manner, and insists on being paid weekly rather than all at once, even while under the earth (a square deal, in his eyes).  Their interactions with each other, and with the variety of Icelandic folk they encounter on their way to the volcano which is their means of ingress, are wittily and cleverly depicted.  These character moments are the high point of the novel; one wonders how much of their clever interplay originates with Verne and how much is an invention of the translator (who, in this edition, remains sadly anonymous).  Whether the novel's tone in its English version is added or simply preserved in translation, full marks to whomever this perceptive soul is.    Though one reflexively considers Jules Verne a \"science fiction\" writer of a primitive sort, this is really more of an adventure tale and, taken as such, it is generally successful.  The adventurers don't explore a strange new world so much as become more intimately acquainted with the world they already know, but if the reader doesn't go in expecting flights of pure fancy, the novel is rather satisfying.    Postscript: I should point out that this review refers to the Signet Classic mass market paperback edition of the novel, which features an afterword by Michael Dirda.  Knowing Amazon, it's possible that this review will surface under several different versions, and without clarity, we have nothing.",

It seems odd, to say the least, for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a Quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central Quaker value.

Never heard the name of the guy and didn't expect much; but it was cheap, and so...    Boy, was I wrong! Since then I have made sure that I read every Hiaasen in and out of print, and I'm about to catch up on some of his real old stuff. His writings opened up the world of the writers and the universe of that nook of America called 'Florida', which is about as whacky and demented as it comes. Actually, I've _been_ to Florida, though not down to the Keys; but it's amazing what you miss when you basically just pass through or dip in and out of it. No wonder Piers Anthony used it as the setting for a bunch his, firmly tongue-in-cheek, fantasy novels.     Stormy Weather, to get back to the subject, piled on charcaters I'll never be likely to forget, from the skull-juggling Augustine to the simply impossible 'Skink'. A never-ending litany of ascerbically presented character sketches and Hiaasen's usual--entirely justified!--tirade and caricature of venal politicians, environmental rape and greed; plus some truly and honestly _stupid_ people.    Fun and games and I never looked back. There are other 'Florida' writers I've come to like, especially James Hall and Laurence Shames. Depending on my mood, I sometimes like them better than Hiaasen, especially Laurence Shames. All three of them offer different perspectives on life in and beyond that strange place called 'Florida'. As I said, it depends on my mood. Hiaasen usually ends up at the top when I'm in a 'South Park' disposition; needing satire with heart. And I need some more of that now and soon and please!

There's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated Christianity with this life-negating religion (Deus Irae means \"God of wrath\") and a somewhat Zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel's conclusion.

As for people who claim some sort of health knowledge like tereshina (which she obviously does not posses), I think she is one of those bitter people that needs to add some sugar and spice to her already depressing and pathethic life or better yet keep eating that darn styrofoam junk",

            "input": "2005's Most Dishonest Book . I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).    Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.    Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:      COSTS    Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?    First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called \"out-state\" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely \"goyim,\" and deserve no better...)    Ironically, while less affluent \"out-state\" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their \"marginal\" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)     ACHIEVEMENT    In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the \"LD\" (or \"learning disabled\") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...    In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the \"Lissitz Study\" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the \"naturally\"-integrated, and \"magnet\" schools.    When the Educational Testing Service still \"normed\" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who \"self-selected\" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly \"skewed\" sample relative to the average SLPS student.      Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, (\"The Coleman Report,\" cited in \"Brown v. Board,\") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of \"The Bell Curve\" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.    VESTED INTERESTS    It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a \"co-plaintiff\" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed \"legal expenses\" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.    Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.     Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as \"domestic\" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. (\"I is a teacher.\") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!    Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of \"higher learning\" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.      HYPOCRISY    A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.     Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)    I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's \"Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council\" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)    I considered it an \"opportunity\" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: \"Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?\" (That is, were her kids, who would have been \"poster children\" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)     What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...     (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)",

            "input": "Chain of Emtotions . This book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation. The author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in New York's ghettos. The fierce images of rat-infested homes, and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions. Kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children's point of view to the political views of the country. Also presenting an array of diverse issues such as AIDs, drugs, underage prostitution, death, motives based in moral, religious beliefs, and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader. Feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood. Numerous quotes and examples are given in the book, but one that particularly struck me was when Kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds, \"Not many...Well, to tell the truth, not any who are happy for more than one day...No! Not for one day. For 15 minutes...Not any. That's no lie\"(212). To honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and I'm sure for many others as well. By using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy. Our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support. Examples such as unsanitary hospitals, toxic incinerators, closet sized school rooms, and shabby, less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people. But once again Kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial. He provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives.  It seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets. While reading, it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction, though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were.       Taking into account the brilliant components of the book, I must say that I was vexed by one minor detail; Kozol's overall presentation of his opinions. The beginning of the book revolves around the accounts of parents and children within the area and the author provides few opinions on the subject. But towards the end he fills several pages with statistics followed by passages of his opinions. I feel that this takes away from the book because rather than focusing on the children and people living in the area we turn our attention to the author and how he is impacted by the events and things he witnesses.         Other than this minor dislike I think that the piece as a whole is very informative and certainly does a good job at presenting what appears to be the ideas and realities for several minorities in New York. It may not be a thriller, or adventure novel, but it most certainly is a mystery. A mystery as to how people are able to survive in such hostile conditions and retain hope. Kozol's mastery of rhetoric reveals that the issues taking place have been around and that until something changes they will remain so.",

My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.      When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact \"voice,\" none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of \"purple prose.\" Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the \"perfect\" titular HERO of these books???      Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.     My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.",

However, I had to put it down because I thought it was too negative. It called Rush names. I did not need to have that. Finally, I tried getting it at the library, but they said they did not have a copy, because they said it was \"too controversial.\"    So when the price came down, I bought a used copy for a couple of bucks, and read the whole thing.    I was amazed some more!    Rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show. He was a legendary, rich talk show host. This book tells you exactly how Rush became a rich, popular talk show host. And he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem. And you know, that sort of thing could happen to anybody.    But I had trusted Rush, and his VALUES, and I kind of felt he let me down. So for me, the title is not appropriate. Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Rich Talk Show Host who Cuts Corners on His Values would be a better title. Rush is no idiot, either.    Now, by some \"coincidence\" Al Franken is a talk show host too.

My understanding of theoretical and practical physics (pick your subdiscipline) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans. But I do know a good book when I read one. Unfortunately, Gregory Benford's Cosm was not one of them. If he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists, or to critique the workings of the scientific community, essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book. All of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world, but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action.     The characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today's universities (the novel is set in 2005). The clichés make an early appearance with \"This far out from the city, people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of Coors and a bug zapper\" (p. 8) and continue throughout.     All of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an \"upscale fungus\" and see industrial park developments \"crouched down, as if ashamed.\"     Benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances.     In brief, a particle accelerator experiment of the main character, Alicia, results in the accidental creation of the Cosm, a universe which can be observed (sometimes directly, sometimes not) from inception to death throes. She is (unthrillingly) kidnapped and escapes. She displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood.

            "input": "I truly enjoyed it, but I have a couple concerns . Let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this work.  If you haven't read Michener before, this is a great place to start.  Typical of Michener, he tells the story of a region over the course of centuries in this book.  Michener has selected a particular river that feeds the Chesapeake, the Choptank, as his primary locale, but has populated it with geotypical persons, plantations, and towns, rather than any specific actual persons or towns from the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake.    Having grown up in Maryland, I experienced a great deal of nostalgia for the areas he describes.  The characters he creates are believable and complex.  The stories he tells across the centuries are compelling.    I do have three concerns.  The first is minor -- in the green-covered paperback the word \"scow\" (a flat-bottomed boat) has been replaced with the word \"snow\" in every instance save one.  This makes for some odd reading, especially in the early chapters.    The second seems petty -- I actually believe there is not quite enough information in a nearly 1000-page novel.  He mentions guano trade, which significantly affected the Eastern Shore, only in one sentence at the end of the book.  He doesn't explain some of the early economies very clearly.  (With what was salt purchased from Tortuga?  There was no cash available, and credit with Fithian seems unlikely to have extended there.)  Islands other than the fictional Devon island (e.g. Tighlman Island) suddenly become important at the end of the book, and are referenced as \"the old rivals of Patamoke.\"  If they are old rivals, why didn't they appear before?  Did this get cut out of the book?    My third concern is a very strange charge to levy against Michener.  As anyone who has seen the musical \"South Pacific\" knows, Michener is strongly opposed to racism.  Certainly in this book there are whites, blacks, and indians of the full range of character and talent.  However, the book still seems to have a strange racist undertone that I can't shake from my mind.  It comes from how Michener ties his story together across the centuries.  Every Janney is feckless (except for the one who becomes a Steed).  Every Steed is enterprising, although not necessarily industrious.  Every Turlock is craven.  Every Cater is proud, even if this is expressed differently across the generations.  Every Paxmore is upstanding, even the sad-sack Pusey Paxmore believes he is acting in an upstanding manor until he looks back on what he's done.  One Steed even refuses to acknowledge her own grandchildren because they have Turlock blood in them, and is praised by the author for doing so.    I realize that Michener was using a shorthand to help the reader keep characters straight across the centuries, but the result is rather too \"geneticist,\" arguing that genes determine destiny",

I started this book 3 months ago, reading it only once or twice a week, but gradually i started to read it more and more.  I have spent the last week reading it non-stop, i just finished it about 20 minutes ago.  Anyways, this is a great book, i found it especially fascinating because it is a story about 3 kids in their late teens(and of course a killer car) and me being a teenager, natrually loved this book.  From the first sentance to the last, i had full interest.  I found i could relate to the characters quite often.      It starts off with long time best-friends Arnie Cunningham and Dennis Guidler.  While driving home from work ( maybe it was on the way to work) Arnie spots a run down garabage '58 plymouth and instantly falls in love.  He buys the car from a bitter old man named Roland LeBay(little did i kno that LeBay plays such a big part in the book).  Throughout the book, Arnie spends his time with non-other than Christine(the name of the car), until he starts going out with the preetiest girl in school.  Arnie starts to change at this point. He is no longer the biggest nerd in school, and he is changing both physically and mentally.  But pretty soon the car starts to take over his life, and take the lives of others. This book is all about a love triangle(or in this case quadrilateral) between Arnie, Leigh(arnies girlfriend), Dennis and Christine.    I recommend this book 100%. I was actually a little afraid to read the ending of it, because I HATED the end of dreamcathcer( i watched the movie after reading half of the book) and I was not to crazy about the last 20 minutes of IT(the movie, I have yet to read the book), but this book had the best ending (in my opinion) of any book I have ever read.

            "input": "Great book, I loved it! . First, a word about the publishers. . . Somewhere it is decreed, I suppose in the Regency genre publishing house, that all \"Regency Romance\" books must be exactly 218 pages, no more and no less, so that if one author writes less, they make the letters nice and big, three paragraphs to a page. . . And if another author has a longer story, the publishers will squeeze ten paragraphs, in tiny letters, onto one page. . . This is one of the books where you have ten paragraphs (or more) per page, plus there is so much going on in the story that the plotline is constantly changing . . . for me, this made for some frustrating reading.    But as for the story itself - this is my first by Allison Lane, and what I see, I like.  I was pre-warned that she is a \"darker\" Regency author, so that I did not find the issues explored in this story shocking.  Yes, it's sad, but, unfortunately, there really are parents like that.  (Today, since arranged marriages are not really \"done\" it will play out in the form of career, or how their children should live their lives. . .)  As for the character of Reggie - he's a really nice, sympathetic character, but I'm afraid that his problem was a real one.  Maybe it's uncommon, and he seems to have had an unusually bad case of it, but it is only today that they have medication for these problems (those who have read the story know which medication I mean).      I loved the heroine!  I hate to say this, but she sounds so exactly like me, that how can I not have loved this story?    Miss Joanna Patterson was hired as a sort-of companion to Lady Harriet, to launch her into society - and to find her a husband, perferably a rich one.  Being rather plain, awkward, and bespecled besides, Joanna has no such hopes for herself.      Lord Sedgewick Wylie is not only a dandy, but he is the biggest dandy of them all - actually, he is a social leader.  Always, always, impeccably dressed, always with perfect manners, Lord Sedgewick is as different from Joanna as could possibly be.  But what society does not know, and would possibly ridicule if they did, is that under that dandified clothing is a smart and educated man - and he is starting to get bored with the society role that he is playing.    In short, this is a couple that is different as could possibly be, and would never have even looked at each other, if fate had not intervened, in not one, not two, but three separate \"accidents\" involving each other, the last one culminating in their forced marriage - although \"marriage\" for show, and \"marriage\" for real are two separate things entirely. . .     Quite early on in the book, I recognized the plot.  Yes, I was right.  This book has a similar plot to \"The Viscount who Loved me\" by Julia Quinn.  I checked the publishing dates to see \"who cheated\" but they were published quite closely together, actually this book was first. . . Maybe this is a fairly common Regency plot device, I haven't read enough Regency books to know if this is so or not.    And unlike some previous reviewers, I really liked the character of Lord Sedgewick.  He is a refreshing change from the rakes, and more rakes, that seem to populate all the Regency fare that I have read so far.  Although a dandy, he is responsible, and uses his position in society wisely - he actually tries to help people.  He is not a rake, nor does he gamble in excess, or drink etc. etc.  In short, in many ways a paragon.  And although he does treat the heroine badly at some point in the book, his reasons are very clear, and believable, to me.  Besides, once he gets over his initial reaction, he does apologize, and he even comes to an understanding within himself as to why he treated her this way, and how he will change in the future.  Hey, you can't ask for much better than that.  Even if I am the only one, I do see a very nice future for the rest of their lives together.    I like Allison Lane's style.  I like her complicated plots, I liked her *very\" complex characters, and I especially liker her *very* realistic portrayal of the issues she has chosen to deal with in this Regency novel.  This is one smart lady, and I really enjoyed her writing.      I recommend this book for anyone who likes Regencies a bit *darker*, but more realistic, and especially for those who like complicated plots with full-fleshed characters, created by an extremely intelligent author",

And thats not because i was \"glued to it\" or \"thought it was a real page-turner\" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a \"cookie-cutter\" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the \"horror genre\", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama.  However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind \"Insomnia\" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking \"oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?\"  THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable \"generic\" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very \"generic\" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product.  Some examples of King's finest work would be \"The Talisman\", \"Night Shift\"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The \"Dark Tower\" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few.  And if you have not read any of \"The Bachman books\" (King as Bachman) \"Rage\", \"The Long Walk\", Road Work\", and \"The Running Man\", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.

The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average \"backyard breeder\" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers",

This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations.

I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.     The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers.

            "input": "kabbalah . I learned a great deal from Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) through his text, &quot;On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism&quot;.  Dr Bernard McGinn, Divinity School, University of Chicago, wrote in the introduction, &quot;I believe that all students of mysticism should read Scholem, not only for his profound insights into the Jewish mystical tradition, but also to deepen their understanding of the dynamics of other mysticisms -- Christian, Islamic, and even those further afield.&quot;  Professor Scholem presents an historical perspective with the full knowledge that there are other approaches.  &quot;From an historical point of view&quot;, he writes, &quot;the sum of religious phenomena known as mysticism consists in the attempts of mystics to communicate their experiences to others.&quot;  Within this context, this text explores broad sweeping topics in each chapter -- topics that deservedly have receieved attention by intelligent scholars for centuries.  In the first chapter, &quot;Religious Authority and Mysticism&quot; Herr Doktor Scholem presents a thesis fundamental to his research, &quot;there is no mysticism as such, but only the mysticism of particular religious systems, Christian, Islamic and Jewish mysticism, and so on&quot;.  The mystic working within a religious system is, according to Scholem, at the same time both conservative and revolutionary.  &quot;Conservative&quot; because the mystic tries to preserve the sources of traditional authority, and &quot;revolutionary&quot; because the mystic also may subsititue his own opinion for that prescribed by authority.  In the second chapter, titled, &quot;The Meaning of the TORAH in Jewish Mysticism&quot;, Scholem explains the dynamic relationship between the TORAH and the mystic.  Scholem presents three fundamental principles on which the Kabbaslistic conceptions of the nature of the TORAH are based: (1) YWVH; (2) TORAH as oganism; (3) Infinite meaning of the divine word.  As an example of the third, in addition to the the concept of written and oral TORAHs, the author of the &quot;ZOHAR&quot; speculates four levels of meaning: (1) literal (2) hermeneutic (3) allegorical and (4) mystical.  The history of Judaism, Scholem explains in the third chapter, is a tension between the purity of the reality of GOD.  The dynamic involved is clearly presented in the realization that the price of GOD's purity is the loss of her living reality.  Scholem offers that the Book Bahir, a cornerstone of 12th century Kabbalistic thought, introduces myth into Judaism.  Remarkably, it contends evil as an attribute of GOD.  In a similar vein, the commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah by Judah ben Barzilai introduced speculative thinking to Jewish theosophy.  The fourth chapter, &quot;Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists&quot; presents a solution to a problem faced by each new generation.  Namely, how are the traditions passed on in a vital and meaningful medium.  The Mishnal codified Jewish religious law and ritual for an agrarian community had survived for centuries.  As the agrarian society diminished, the TORAH became obsolete and the natural rituals became less meaningful, historical rituals.  The Spanish Kabbalists found a new ritual to express the old traditions.  Scholem writes, &quot;The rejuvenation of religion repeatedly finds its expression in a return to ancient images and symbols, even when these are 'spiritualized' and transformed into speculative constructions.&quot;  R. Yanassan Gershom has already succinctly summarised the fifth chapter which deals with the concept of the Golem.  I will take the liberty to direct you to his comments.  If you are interested in historical issues of the Kabbalah, this is essential reading for you",

I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.    The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.    Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .    The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.    This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.    Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.     In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.    - CV Ric",

Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here.

In 1870's New York society, detail was everything from what food you served at gatherings to the type of carriage you rode in. Everything one did or possessed made a statement about who they are and what they stood for. You get this point clearly in the beginning when the characters are introduced. The main character Newland Archer comes from a respectable family so it would make sense that he would marry May Welland who comes from the respectable Mingott family. But things don't run smoothly when May's cousin Countess Ellen Olenska returns to America after leaving her European husband. Rumors ensue among members of society forcing Newland to take sides with Ellen because of May. But soon Newland sees in Ellen a free spiritedness that he doesn't see in May. Soon he finds himself trapped in a triangle. The whole plot kept me fascinated because just when you think something is going to happen an interesting development occurs. Just remember everything isn't what it seems in the book. On the surface a party is given for a member of the family, but underneath are harsh judgments and diversions of person's intentions.

Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on.  This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America.  There isn't really a plot.  The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal.  It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author.",

Reacher is one of those very lucky or very unlucky \"heros.\" And if you're one of those readers who like to try to figure out who is doing the dirty deeds, you can't. There are absolutely no clues you can use to determine the perpetrators.    And who says the Secret Service doesn't act proactively? While this is one of the book's major premises, the history of the Service is filled with proactive activities to protect those who come under their care.    I remember once when the President came to my hometown and spoke on the Statehouse steps. Office workers in nearby buildings used telescopes to get a better view. All of them were seen by Secret Service agents and men with guns visited them in one big hurry. Radios were used in abundance. And this was over thirty years ago. Do you think the Service has become more capable or less capable since then? If a single radio was used in this story, the perpetrators would have been caught about halfway through the book.    When President Bush (the first one) wanted to walk across the Mackinac Bridge for the annual walk, they took over the entire hotel where he would be staying, and not because they needed the space. A list of others who would be in attendance during the walk and at the dinner the previous evening had to be vetted starting 6 weeks prior to his visit, including local police. They even kept the pitcher of ice tea that he would be drinking from in a locked box watched over by an agent (same with condiments). After spending a bazillion dollars up to and after the President's meal, the Prez graciously paid for his own meal, and left a nice tip. Big of him. So agents don't just show up a couple of hours or in one case in the book, a few minutes before the big event, and throw a cordon around him.

It's comforting to see those feelings described and reflected outside yourself. If adults act like the whole world is happy-happy all the time, it can feel very lonely and isolating when you have other feelings. I would venture to guess that empathizing with characters in stories helps children develop a sense of connection between their own feelings and other people's feelings. This connection makes us feel less lonely and also allows us to be genuinely caring toward others.      I can still see, in my mind's eye, the picture of Sylvester the Rock under a blanket of snow, and feel the almost unbearable empathy that I felt for him when I read this book as a child. But it was a good feeling to feel such profound emotions. It was not unpleasant--it was very real, alive, and human--it made me feel connected with the world.

            "input": "Not worth Saving . People have called Chuck Palahniuk's writing many things: Neo Goth, Modern Goth., New Goth....just dont get the idea that its all about whiny teenagers wearing black and griping about their latent vampire powers through bad poetry. No, Palahniuk writes a different kind of book without all of the grim color and stale mythology, but he maintains the same themes: deterioration of the human condition, lack of moral fiber in today's society, and the danker recesses of the human psyche. Survivor tackles these topics with dazzling success and even enters a few new contenders to the mix such as commercialism, consumerism, and materialism.    And this is all very old news to absolutely everybody but me, because Chuck Palahniuk has been around for a while now. It was only until recently I decided to pick up one of his paperbacks at the suggestion of my thugish Top 8 Myspace friend with too much facial hair and the clown tattoo.     Now, the way I like my stories told is with a good opening page, a large use of style, and a frugal use on the words. Typically, I don't read too many novels over 300 pages long. I have read plenty of longer books in the past, and all too often the only thing that separates a long story from a short one is that the author of a short book knows how to consolidate his word use and when to shut up. I'm happy to say Chuck Palahniuk is such a writer by all counts. Like any good stylist, his words flow like water straight from the page into your brain as the protagonist's situation is fleshed out.  Survivor opens in the first person with a single man on a plane preparing to crash into the Australian Outback.  He's the last surviving member of a death cult who has made some strange decisions...some better than others. At this time he is known the world over as a great spiritual leader, Anti Christ figure, and media mogul. There are many misconceptions about who he is and why he's on said death plane, and he'd like to set the record straight with the help of the jets black box.    And from there we meet the narrator, Tender Branson, now in the past tense and living in humble times as a religious servant. Members from his cult are killing themselves left and right, so the government gives Branson his own psychotherapist and puts him on suicide watch. But Branson is way past believing anything the church filled his mind with, and is more interested in telling other people to kill themselves after they find one of his phony suicide hotline numbers stuck to the side of a bus stop. He works for a couple that is very well off, and through his years of service has accumulated a library's worth of useful housekeeping tips. The reader is educated, in detail, how to properly remove tear stains from pillow cases, urine from drapes, bullet holes in walls, and blood from fur coats.     Everyday situations are presented from the most warped of perspectives, and depending on the readers attitude, this may either be disturbing or refreshing. Example: Is learning that everyone you love will someday die from owning and loving upwards of six hundred pet Goldfishes that have all died strike you as ironic, or sad? Are you intrigued by romances sparked in a cemetery, or turned off? How about an over analytic shrink who convinces a hypochondriac that he has multiple problems in an attempt identify and cure just one? Clever, or whatever? If you're leaning towards the former with any of these, I might have an author to recommend.    The characters are wonderful, and I took to them like a kid to a black van with candy. They have no need for convention. They have their own means of courtship, their own philosophies forged in solitude and cynicism, their own reasons for being attracted to someone else, and their own reasons for living and dying. But none of this is to say that everything is Mentos and Diet Coke. While I've never read another Palahniuk book, I have seen Fight Club, a filmed adaptation if his book, and the voice of the protagonist in that story is very similar to the voice in this one. I couldn't even read a sentence here without hearing Edward Norton's voice, so similar were the personalities. Both had a very sardonic tone towards everything modern and cynical one liners about the status quo. Sloppy, but Ill let it pass.    Did I mention that everything I just said only applies to the first half of the book? The second half falls to pieces and leaves what could have been over arching themes or meanings in smouldering shambles. It's a shame really. The first one hundred and fifty pages of Survivor read very much like something I might very well write ten years from now, whereas the second half was more like the rough draft of something I could write now. Character actions break the bank of plausibility and some scenes read like the author is trying to beat you over the head with some point that you just can't make out. For a book that started out so strong, I was left with a story that ultimately delivered nothing but the comical and poignant one liners it offered along the way. But hey, that's life, isn't it? Well sure, its life, and its shaggy dog story telling too, but read both halves and tell me that something wasnt wasted from the first one. Threads were coming together.    If the book had stayed on course all the way through, I'd be using this review to announce Chuck Palahniuk as my new favorite author, and maybe Survivor as a favorite book. Unfortunately, the second half was so lacking, I can barely recommend it as a whole. But there's no reason that good writing should go to waste. Use the first two chapters here to qualify yourself for all of Palahniuk's writings. You can do it in one sitting and be introduced to a wonderful mind and voice. From there you can hopscotch the Palahniuk library with some assurance that everything will be A-OK in your tragedy of choice.",

With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers.  As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective.  Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10).  As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan.  Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media.  Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world.  As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable.

            "input": "Overblown and Messy . While Julia Barrett touches on the language \"spoken\" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit.  The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good.  After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.    In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her \"intended\".  In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all.  They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.      Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins).  There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging.  Dear me!  How did anything get done?  I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book!  Honestly, I was disgusted.      If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte.  Instead try Sandition.      Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places.  Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker.  However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt.  The characters actually grow.  They learn.  Here is an example.    In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an \"invalid\" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments.  To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease.  And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them.  (sigh).    In Sandition:  Arthur Parker is an \"invalid\" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain.  He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest.  He learns from her what it is to be healthy.  They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes.  He collects and she draws what he collects.  He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.      Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love.  You can watch her struggle over \"does he or does he not\".  It's a much more delightful alternative to all the \"our herione\" and \"our hero\" and \"my herione\" and \"my hero\"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).      So, to sum up?  Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition.  It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library",

Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is\"Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School\".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as\"Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies\" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 \"Failure of the 'New Economics'\".",

Fareed Zakaria rightly forces his readers to think harder than they usually do about the interdependence existing between freedom and democracy.  In the West, constitutional liberalism, with its checks and balances, gave birth to modern democracy.  However, too much democracy can paradoxically lead to less freedom. Think for instance about humiliated Germany after WWI under the Weimar Republic and its subsequent mistreatment of different minorities for specious reasons under the Nazis.  Similarly, more choices can result into less accountability.  Think for instance about those who fail to plan financially for old age independent of a social security system increasingly at risk of insolvency due to shifting demographics.  In the U.S. and overseas, right without responsibility is usually as immoral and unjust as responsibility without right.  Unelected bodies such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the World Trade Organization are a necessary evil.  Expertise of their respective members is judged more important than their democratic legitimacy to hopefully pursue the better good of either a human community or a society of sovereign states.  These unelected officials are not held accountable to the tyranny of instant gratification that too many elected officials perceive, rightly or wrongly, among a majority of their constituents.  Because unelected bodies are a necessary evil to account for human weaknesses, they should remain the exception rather than the rule.  Pleading for an increase in unelected bodies, though well-intentioned, could paradoxically lead to a weakening support of the best-in-class in their respective categories.",

            "input": "I wouldn't recommend this book... lacks credibility. . In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process \"domestication\" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.    While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.    According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).    The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, \"domesticated\" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.      One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God.\"  He uses it to epitomize the use of \"word\" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says \"The word was made flesh and dwelt among us\".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather \"Jesus Christ\".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that \"sin begins with rejection of yourself\" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.    In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz \"you are dealing with yourself, not me\" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.     According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was \"trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage\" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.    Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.    In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.      While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations.",

            "input": "Exchanges are the foundation of weight and blood sugar managment. . There is nothing more basic for weight and blood sugar management than the food exchanges. They are called exchanges because the foods in each group can be exchanged with each other and still supply a similar amount of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and other nutrients. \"The Official Pocket Guide to Dieabetic Exchanges\" is an excellent resource for  describing the nature and benefits of the exchanges.    I have been a diabetic since the age of 50. It is certainly easier to use the exchange system then laboriously counting calories and carbohydrates. They give us a short hand method of coming up with close approximations.     One thing that can also be of benefit to diabetics is the glycemic index which measures the impact of various carbohydrates on our blood sugar level. Glucose is given a value of 100. All other foods are ranked according to the percentage rise they cause as compared to glucose. For example, apple juice has a glycemic index of 40. This means that a serving of apple juice containing 25 grams of carbohydrates would cause a blood sugar rise that is 40 percent of that which would be caused by 25 grams of pure glucose.    Related to the glycemic index is the glycemic load which applied the glycemic index to serving sizes. To calculate the glycemic load the grams of carbohydrates (less the fiber) is multiplied by the glycemic index expressed as a percentage. An exchange of apple juice has 15 grams of carbohydrates. Multiplying this by 40% (glycemic index of 40) yields a glycemic load of 6. Now lets compare this to 15 gm of watermelon. Watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 which is higher than table sugar. The glycemic load of watermelon is 11 (15 x .72 = 11). Thus the impact of watermelon on our blood sugar is almost twice for the same level of carbohydrates. Fortunately, a half of watermelon only has six grams of carbohydrates as compared to a half cup of apple juice which has 14. Measured on a volume basis the apple juice actually has a higher glycemic impact. No such luck with a baked potato which has a glycemic index of 85. A half cup of baked potatoes has 38 grams of carbohydrate. This yields a glycemic load of 32 (38 X .95 = 32).    Determining the glycemic impact of foods does require more effort than just counting exchanges. But by getting involved in the details I have been able to lose nearly 80 pounds and am able to manage my blood sugar levels with diet and exercise. This has certainly been a worthwhile effort for me.  I am sure that it would be for others.    Good Eating",

And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.      It's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.  This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears.  I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!      I am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.      Randy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.      The amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.      It is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.  As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community.  Where will the next Randy Shilts, Bill Kraus, and Dr. Gottlieb and the other saviors come from--and will they come soon enough?",

As Whitehead's character is pontificating about the nuances of how global interest rates affect the construction costs that a hypnothetical business will incur, Dangerfield's character can't help but blurt out \"Why in the world would you build when you can rent in this market for half a buck a square foot and let someone else have the headaches of property management?\". It quickly becomes apparent that the real-world experience of Dangerfield's character is far more useful than the off-topic theoretical knowledge of the professor. This author reminds me of Whitehead's character: Thoroughly vetted in academia and obviously having zero experience in the real world, and thus having zero useful real-world insight to share with his readers.    The most-cited references in the chapter bibliographies are the annual reports of the big I-banks, and the rest of the book is written at the same naieve, glossy-overview level.    In summary, if you want to know what it's like to serve in the Navy, you can get yourself a copy of the Navy's glossy brochure on what Navy careers are supposed to be like, or you can find a vet who's been in the Navy to tell you what it's really like. Reading this book is like reading the Navy's glossy brochure.",

John MacAndrew is away trying to get his fortune back after Beatrice stole it all in an effort to keep Wideacre for her children. Julia and Richard early on seem to represent the good and bad Beatrice. Julia resembles Beatrice, and she has her excellent horse riding skills, plus the ability to farm and work the land. All those were \"the good Beatrice.\" Richard only has the insatiable hunger to keep Wideacre for himself and pass it on to his heir. He doesn't care about anything or anybody else. This represents \"the bad Beatrice.\" At the end of Wideacre all Beatrice could think about was raising enough money to secure Wideacre for her heirs, and she turned a blind eye to the poverty and sickness that she was causing. I like how Philippa Gregory weaves historical facts into the story, such as how the poor had to live in order to survive, and how the landowners made such unfair laws, and how they controlled the courts. The parts of the book that were really aggravating to me were the ones where Julia had absolutely no backbone whatsoever.... especially after Richard rapes her. I think Celia and John would definitely have believed her, not Richard.   I have really liked every Philippa Gregory book, whether from the Other Boleyn Girl series or the Wideacre series. I'm looking forward to reading the last book, Meridon.",

But for reasons I'll get to below, this novel series is a stand-out from that era, and still well worth reading.    This book was actually written after the fall of communism, but the plot takes place a few years before it. In this book Samson returns to work for London Central and deals with a disastrous assignment in East Germany; an internal struggle to keep positions in a down-sizing agency; etc.  The book plot is interesting enough, but running alongside it are several series-length plots that continue to engross the reader: can Bernard and his wife Fiona rebuild their marriage after her apparent defection and return? In fact, can Fiona even recover from her ordeal? What about Gloria?    I just recently re-read the entire Bernard Samson series (of which this is the seventh out of nine novels). It is one of the best novel series I have ever read, and certainly one of the best espionage genre series ever. There are so many things to like about this series - the in-depth characterizations; the pithy observational asides about people and cultures; the references to multiple languages and their subtleties; the gritty European settings; the hidden plot developments and character motivations that the narrator either can't or won't see; etc.    The author claims that each of these books can be read on their own, and perhaps they could be. But you can get a lot more enjoyment out of it if you start at the beginning with _Berlin Game_ (or even better yet - start with the WWII prequel: _Winter_).",

I became a scientist (for real) because of those two books.  However, \"The Big Ker-Plop\", despite a promising beginning, just isn't as good.    It starts out great: it's wonderful to be with the boys again as they go fishing on a foggy morning in Strawberry Lake, and somethign BIG falls from the sky and lands somewhere in the water... To be back on Strawberry Lake again with these brainy, energetic boys is terrific, and right away there's a mystery to solve.  The boys enlist the aid of Henry Mulligan to find the object that fell in the lake, and how they do it-- using some trigonometry and a magnetometer-- is described with scientific accuracy, believeable, clever and entertaining.  It's such a relief to have a plot where problems are solved by something other than Harry Potter's wand.    But after the boys tell the Air Force where they found the object, the plot seriously bogs down.  For all intents and purposes, the boys aren't really involved in the plot thereafter, except as observers and (maybe) engineers.  The boys just invent solutions to problems-- and they are clever solutions, described with scientific accuracy.  But the Air Force does all the \"action\", and the boys just watch them through a telescope as the adults try to retrieve the lost atomic bomb.  I understand that it's realistic that the Air Force would go after a lost atomic bomb themselves, and would not let any civilians anywhere near the site-- yes, realistic, but it makes for a boring story.  It's not fun anymore when the adults do all the work.    The adults are an important part of the story, and the adult characters are all paper-thin cliches (the good-hearted Air Force colonel, the hard-bitten reporter, the fat news photographer), uninteresting.  Brinley was a brilliant plotter, able to write plausible real-world stories with clever twists-- but he had a major defect as a writer: he loved to write \"clever\" dialogue full of ripostes and \"witty\" put-downs, which in fact were never clever or funny.  The adults do a LOT of talking in this book-- whole chapters consist of their dialogue-- and when the idiot mayor of Mammoth Falls is engaging in \"clever\" repartee with the barber or some other adult, the witticisms are so unfunny, it just makes me wince",

Ethics is not a matter of conservative or liberal (if that's true than god himself has to be a liberal not to mention bible talked about ethical behavior too). This book focused on why we need ethics in business and how proper ethics enforcement can save a business from corruption and other questionable behavior which eventually may bring down a business (think Enron). It talked about both sides and didn't force someone's opinion on us rather helped us make our own decision which will be ethical and benefiting to the business.

I'd seen the movie \"Valley of the Dolls,\" whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book, but only recently did I read Jacqueline Susann's magnum opus.  What a pleasant surprise! This engaging novel, despite its length, is a fast read.  It is better -- far better -- than the film. (The movie, however, is a \"must see\" for its over-the-top acting, 60's fashions and \"so bad it's good\" storyline.)      Although initially billed (to great effect) as a steamy romance novel, the book is much more substantive.  Each of the characters is well-developed, and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing.  Before it was fashionable, Susann used the character of Anne Welles to explore one woman's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career.  Susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon.  Neely O'Hara is initially a sympathetic character, but has enough of the \"bitter greens\" (envy, jealousy and bile) which, when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills, leads to  her rise and fall.  And Jennifer North knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations.  These characters are real, and one need not be in show business to know them.    Although written in 1966 (with a story that begins in 1945), the plotline is not dated.  Neither is the message: Susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness.  There is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers.",

Long Spoon Lane: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel, by Anne Perry was another excellent mystery set in Perry's evocative Victorian setting.  The mystery in this novel was not of the \"knock your socks off who would have ever thought it\" type.  It was, rather, a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government's response to the terrorists' acts.  It was very interesting to read about a piece of legislation that some of the characters supported.  The legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes.  The obvious allusion to America's Patriot Act and the debate it has spawned is an excellent piece of the overall picture.      This book focused on Thomas primarily, and his relationship with one of his true enemies.  His Professor Moriarty if you will.      I recommend this book and give it a solid and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars.",

The Great Warpath is a comprehensive integration of archaeology and history, the type of book history needs more of to make past subject matter more tangible and believable.  Ironically, there are surprisingly few works  which supplement history with archaeology or vice-versa.  With The Great  Warpath Starbuck fills the vacancy as he carefully balances the two fields  and raises archaeology to a new level of importance.  Specifically, the  book deals with British Military history in the late 18th century as  Starbuck interprets it from his many years as an archaeologist.  All the  major sights of the French and Indian War in New York State are covered, as  well as a few sights from the American Revolution.  The Great Warpath  refers to the Hudson River, the main corridor in New York State, along  which military engagements of the French and Indian War, and the American  Revolution occured.   Undoubtedly, The Great Warpath has something to offer  every military historian who is not satisfied solely with the limits of  written history",

The ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age.    This book is about sensitivity, not sensitivity to the weeping child, but the sensitivity required to maintain a successful business. This books speaks about being not only sensitive to your customers, but being sensitive to your employees, a major problem with many companies finding it difficult to survive.    Actions speak louder than words, everyone knows it, hardly anybody does it. Empowerment, give people the means and freedom to shine. Listen, quit trying to teach the world, let the world teach you. Keep things simple, simplicity allows for focus and leads to success. Easy concepts to understand, not so easy to apply. This book is about principles.    It could certainly be argued that most of the advice given in this book is anecdotal, but this fact is also why it has lasted this long as a viable text. Those that want to argue this point are usually the same individuals that don't understand the principals and don't apply them, hence why they need this the most. Sure, most people intuitively know these principles, but how many need reminded?    People are moved more by general concepts that are flexible enough to be applied to most situations.

If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others.....",

I found myself so drawn to Charlie and to what was happening to him, to his longing for acceptance and love, and to his quest to make sense of his world.  The desire for acceptance and love--from oneself and from others--is something all people have in common regardless their IQ.  I cried as Charlie regressed, all the while knowing what was happening to him, realizing the profundity of his loss, yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science.      I can't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book's ending was predictable.  For a while, I thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love.  When Fay put the female mouse in with Algernon, I kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out, first with the mouse, later with Charlie.  One possible ending would have been to let Charlie have his high IQ but, unlike Algernon, be able to integrate intellect with emotion.  Another ending would have been to go back to the lower IQ, and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone.  This of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book's end and were able to truly take Charlie in and befriend him.  I think the author came up with a good ending by causing Charlie to lose the intellect, but to have gained self-love and the love of others, things he did not have at the start of his journey.",

If you've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends, you probably shouldn't peruse this particular book.  HOWEVER.  If you happen to enjoy a good \"why\" story from Africa, you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated \"Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears\".      In a kind of Chicken Little series of events, a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending, ultimately, in the sun no longer rising.  When the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun's disappearance, they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame.  Ever since, mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not \"everyone\" is still angry at them.  The answer is a satisfying (I love this descriptive sound) KPAO!    The illustrations are splendid.  During the day they are set against a white background.  By the time the sun disappears, they pop out of a black setting.  Kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene.  It's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme \"The House the Jack Built\".

I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.    So this is just a warning.

I will never put so much credence in reviews again.  This would definitely not be one that you would thumb through at the bookstore and buy.

His whole approach is to have an arsenal of canned phrases that you tell your kid for various circumstances.      This doesn't sound like a bad thing at first until you find out what unimaginative over-simplistic blabber that \"Chick\" offers.  I could point out samples from every page of the first 25 that I read and the dozen or so others that I then skimmed through.  Just quoting this pansy-ass fluff turns my stomach.  Here is a story he tells a speaker who was distracted by a couple of kids talking at a lecture...     \"Frowning, he looked at them and very quietly said 'I'm feeling distracted by your behavior.  Please make a different choice.' By telling these students to make a different choice the speaker used language that communicated respect.  His message informed them 'I see you as responsible for your own actions.  You control your behavior.  You choose your responses to life.'    Every page has this same sickening tone to it.  If you want to avoid reality and miss the opportunities to affect your children in a way that builds self-esteem and confidence in them with real heart to heart interaction and instead gum them up with garbage talk then this book is for you.  Otherwise, to quote the author \"PLEASE MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE\" and find a better book or just use your own intuition and common sense.

            "input": "Master of the ironic twist. . A collection of 100 or more short stories by O. Henry?  My mouth waters already!  It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this.  I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end.  O. Henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate, and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller.  Born William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym O. Henry. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.    Firstly, his brilliant use of language.  These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers.  Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories, marred only by the occasional \"Lordy\".  \"Ulysses and the Dogman\" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets.  Also exemplary is \"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches\" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken.  \"A Comedy in Rubber\" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers.  And \"Sisters of the Golden Circle\" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters \"of the plain gold band.\"  \"An Unfinished Story\" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.    Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time.  O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with warm and sympathetic colours.  His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished.  Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. \"The Gift of the Magi\" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up.  Another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is \"The Pendulum\", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts.  \"The Cop and the Anthem\" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite.  \"The Furnished Room\" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.    Thirdly, his warm humour.  O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language.  Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other.  And on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others.  One of his most popular stories is \"The Handbook of Hymen\", recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information.  And then there is O. Henry's fictional character Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in \"Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet\" and \"The Exact Science of Matrimony\".  \"Let Me Feel Your Pulse\" pokes fun at doctors, while in \"Next to Reading Matter\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.    Fourthly, his ironic twist.  One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed.  Like the Jeff Peters stories, \"The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein\" also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable.  Other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include \"Witches' Loaves\" and  \"While the Auto Waits\".   The twist that comes at the end of \"The Hypotheses of Failure\" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you.  But perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in \"The Last Leaf\", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.      The Wordsworth collection is superlative, because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems.  It consists of 100 stories, showcasing a wide range of O. Henry's short-story talents.  A few popular favorites are missing, such as \"Schools and Schools\", \"Shearing the Wolf\", \"The Green Door\", and \"The Pimienta Pancakes.\"  But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion.  The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!  Don't pass up on these! - GODLY GADFL",

The ability of the author to go back and forth between characters seemlessley is impeccable and can never be duplicated by another.  The idea behind Breakfast of Champions is a conflict between two main characters, Kilgore Trout & Dwayne Hoover, both with seemingly separate lives and completely different views on life, but once their paths are crossed, their lives change forever.  In the beginning, a description of the characters are offered with extensive background information all leading up to their lives at the present and how in some way, shape, or form, they both rely on eachother for sanity. The author then goes even further to describe how their present life predicaments are affecting their outlooks on life and their performence both sexually and mentally are changing with every breath they take.  Vonnegut goes back and forth between voices, a pious & omniscient figure to becoming either both or one of the main characters, al done seemlessly and impeccably.  Kilgore Trout writes stories that the author comes up with which are then transduced as being sources of porographic ideas and Dwayne Hoover is a man who is beoming more and more psychotic everyday, he is losing his grip on reality and with the coming of Kilgore Trout to an art convention that Dwayne is also attending, Trout's stories, specifically one about all people being pre-set robots, causes Dwayne to snap and go on a rampage harming those who are most closest to him as well as people who need to be harmed, but still have no right to be harmed by Dwayne.  If anything, this book is a masterpiece and a work of art and I would recommend this book to all whose mind is as twisted and confusing as the author's, as well as someone who can put up with consistent references to the male genitalia, as grotesque as it might become",

The first third of the book was the main character describing a history of her life by describing pictures she had found, and giving a short story for each one.  The second section, told from her point of view, gave the reader insight into her high school life, dealing with peer pressure, school, and dating.  In the third part of the book,  she begins college, and also begins to spiral out of control, and the books tone shows this.

Not only the legal status but the personal outlooks of women changed immeasurably  in the period this book covers; the subtitle speaks of space and power, but Deutsch  has also given us a fine overview of intellectual change: what women thought, and  why they thought in those ways, during an era of astonishing industrial and social  development. Through her research, we can see why the women of Henry James  were not the same as those of F. Scott Fitzgerald--and they were very different.    We are used to sympathizing with the plight of working class women, and giving  great credit to the founders of the settlement houses and political groups that helped  them, but until now I had never realized how class differences affected attitudes, and  how perfectly reasonable women of either set found great difficulty in  understanding how those of the other thought and felt. This book has helped me get  a better understanding of both groups.      In recent months I've been reading heavily in Boston history and in women's history  of this period. This book is far and away the best thing I've found. Having done  historical research using primary sources, I can tell you this author has done an  immense amount of work, and it has paid off. She uses not only the minutes of  meetings and legal reports, but personal letters and contemporary novels to tell the  story. She writes clearly, and the book is well organized. If you want a real feel for  the lives of women during a period of tremendous change, this book is the best place  I know to get it. Deutsch straightens out a lot of misconceptions, and helps to clarify  an extremely complex period.",

            "input": "Easily the premier book on the subject of pain and suffering . This great work by Phil Yancey was the Christian book of the year in the 70's, and has lasted the test of time.  This is easily the best book on the subject of pain and suffering that I have read; it's teachings are on the mark and scriptural.    Yancey nails it when he writes that the suffering in this world is a democracy; that we are all part of it, we all suffer, and we all can help.  He makes some fine points considering all areas of the subject.  He clearly balances the sovereignty of God and His will with our blessings as His children and our works.  He hits on sowing and reaping, as well as the fact that just like Job, sometimes bad things happen to us not as a direct result of anything we did.  What I like best is Yancey dives right in, going to Leper colonies and interviewing with people who have suffered life-time dehabilitating injuries.  It's interesting to see how they've coped and how they view God, and how their suffering has changed their personal relationship with God.    Indeed suffering is universal, yet there is no universal answer behind the causes of it or how to deal with it.  I've heard pastors preach that people have died because they smoked cigarrettes, or got a sexually transmitted disease because of permiscuous sex.  But the question begs to be asked, what about those who did those things and didn't die?  Is it different for a Christian as opposed to a non-Christian?  What man on this earth walks close enough with God to have the power to decide what sin resulted in what judgment?  If earthquakes are a judgment from God,... are headaches a judgment from God too?    And it's certainly an issue that none of us should be pompous about.  One reviewer gave this book a one-star rating, saying that \"God gives suffering when believers desecrate his house.\"  This is a type of religious crap that this book dispells.  Isn't it true that none of us are righteous; even our righteous acts are like filthy rags to the Lord?  Then are we categorizing sin by saying that homosexuality can destroy a nation, but the hateful attitude of a right-wing pastor cannot?  If Christians who tithe are to be blessed by God, then why have some 'tithers' went bankrupt, while some athiests (and Christian false-teachers) become million-aires?  Did 9/11 happen because of the liberal and homosexual communities, as said Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson?  Or did it in fact happen because W and the family have gotten in bed financially with Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations, none of which give a rats a__ about America, and even profited from 9/11 when America spent billions on weapons and defense programs..... run by Saudis.    Only a true biblical view of the causes and lessons of suffering can help our walk with God to be more fruitful.  You'll find no faith/health/prosperity quick fixes in this one.  You'll also find nobody on this earth who knows all the answers.  This book definitely gives power to that journey with Jesus Christ, however.    Just wondering.... a reviewer of this book has declared a \"Chinese victory over the USA\", and that China is a 'more Christian nation'.  Woa, dude.  They must have better drugs in China too, apparently",

Although I agree with several of Mr. Stamper's recommendations (legalizing prostitution, decriminalizing drugs), many of his assertions are straight out of the \"I-Hate-America\" handbook.

Mr. Stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began.  He \"confesses\" that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin' DA.  It was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in, and soon he was a supervisor (all the better to control the average Joe).         The unfortunate thing about this book isn't the stories he relates, or even his recommendations (some good, some not so good), but the haughty way in which he relates it.  Conservatives, Republicans - BAD! Liberals, Democrats - GOOD! (except for unions - bad!)

It's just sensationalising the subject.    I can understand that he may feel he has a point here, and he may have one, I don't know (still), but, as a scientist, I find it impossible to take what he says seriously when it is just littered with remarks that would be better placed in a tabloid newspaper.    He makes some good points about the links between science, media and funding - how organisations will link issues to the cute and furry animals and so on in order to get more support. But these have been made many years ago, and aren't news to me as a social scientist. Ditto for the difficulties for attributing causality (p.128).    What I find, as with Lomborg's book, is that these authors are so busy building a rebuttal to an argument that they themselves produce 'evidence' that is just as biased, if not more so, the other way, and this reduces their credibility to anyone who is not already convinced that they are right. Relying on the rhetoric of powerful soundbites to get those who agree with him is not going to convince those of us who are really trying to learn here.",

Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.    Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.    As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.    For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.    I now appreciate the \"cliffhanger\" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.    Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written",

I learned about it through the recent New York Times \"top fifty\" recommended list, which included several authors I'd never heard of.   Frankly I was concerned that the list would have a couple of weak entries as happens.  \"Independence Day\" reaffirms my faith in reviews, polls, awards (Pulizer) and I'm glad to know that this is just the second installment of an iconic series.    To say the language \"Independence Day\" is poetic is an understatement.  Ford exercises control over both the vernacular and the estoric (on average I didn't know a word every five pages, but that's a good thing - the language is rich and sincere as is the engrossing narrative).  The word \"Angstrom\" appears in the book, perhaps a footnote to Updike, who knows?    Frank's sale to the Markhams is one of those protracted dramas, no, comedies, that weaves through like a Wagner liefmotif.   Wait, that simile strikes the wrong key, because the Markhams, as you get to know them, and you will, in richly parenthetical passages, represent everything you the reader and Frank dislike about pure unadulterated dumbasses.    Ok, I can go on and on about this book, it's subtleties, it's heartwrenching passages about love and divorce, but no, go read it",

Blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among Greek, Roman, and civil law.  He also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights, property, civil procedure, and criminal law in England.  These sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law.    In addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of England's government at the time just before our nation's independence and why it had been superior, at that time, to any other form of government in all of Europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty.  I highly recommend at least volume I to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government.  His explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how English government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from England.    Any scholar, student, or avid reader of political science, law, or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work.    Ignore the earlier critique of the font, the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate.  The only real difference is \"f\" is used in place of \"s\" everywhere but in the last letter of words (\"greateft\" \"fortrefs\" \"fubject\" etc.).  Generally it's very clear when the \"f\" is an \"s\" although there are a few confusing exceptions (e.g. \"wife\" is \"wise\" as in the \"wife laws of England...\").

The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.    My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental.  I know that the chamber of horrors at the \"mental hospital\" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear.  And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.

This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \"democratic\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow",

Originally published anonymously during the war, the author literally flew missions during the day while meeting with the editor in pubs at night to finish the book.    Richey's book reads like a daily journal of his adventures after deploying to France in 1939 to wait out the \"Phony War.\" Once Germany blitzed France and the Low Countries though, things became very busy very quickly. Richey, like his compatriots, fought bravely, but they were greatly outnumbered. As France's defenses collapsed, there was very little they could do.    One of the most interesting aspects is how his view of the war changes from before the shooting war through just a few weeks of real fighting. Their original notion of their work is very chivalrous and idealistic, with lots of references to \"our turn\" to repeat the noble efforts of the aces from World War I. After downing their first German, they gather war trophies from the plane, take pictures, and invited a captured German pilot over for beer and celebration.    A few weeks later, as the British Expeditionary Force continues to retreat, France collapses, and many of their squadron mates in the earlier photos have been killed, there is little chivalry and idealism left. They settle into the grim business of fighting for their life, realizing that the Battle of France is lost and growing fear for what will happen to Britain.    Even in comparing it to World War One accounts (McCudden, Lewis, or Biddle), initially there is a lot of similarity in the events and encounters. Then, it quickly spirals into a brutal onslaught.    The book is easy to read and flows very well. Most readers are probably surprised to learn the book finishes before the Battle of Britain begins. Fortunately, there is a sequel, Fighter Pilot's Summer, that Richey started during the war, but which wasn't completed until after his death in the 1990's.    Any aviation and World War II history buff will be extremely happy with the book and primary source material. This is particularly true given the wealth of information on the Battle of Britain, but the dearth of writing on the air war over France that was the prelude. This book fills an important gap in first hand accounts of aerial combat during the Battle for France.",

To brutally paraphrase the 500 pages of Barbara Tuchman's genius....in regards to the outbreak of World War I, virtually everything that was expected didn't happen, and everything that could have gone wrong did.  Contrary to the \"domino effect\" jargon we're taught in high school (the war was a spontaneous reaction to Archduke Ferdinand's assassination), Tuchman illustrates quite convincingly (as German primary sources have supported...read Kaiser Wilhelm II and General Moltke's speeches and memoirs), this war had years in the planning.     In the movie \"Thirteen Days\", President Kennedy uses the book as a means to deride his hawkish generals and what he considers their poor sense of long-sighted policymaking.  He uses the mistakes made by the generals in \"The Guns of August\" as examples.  But the book is not about the idiocy of generals, or even politicians.  The book does not lay blame or point fingers.  And when the book does pass judgment (stubborn Joffre's Plan 17 should have been aborted much sooner), it reciprocates in later pages (Joffre's stubbornness helps turn the German right flank).      The one question underlying the entire book is \"What if?\"  What if the Belgians at Liege hadn't fought?  What if von Kluck hadn't swung his First and Second Armies inland?  What if Britian had refused to add its troops to the French Sixth Army?  What if the German captain hadn't been killed and the German HQ battle plans not been intercepted?  Every page offers these \"What ifs\", and it keeps the reader on his/her toes.    This book also shuts up the armchair generals who glance over a war, like a road crew worker on Monday morning discussing a football game, and says, \"What idiots...why didn't they do this?  Why didn't they do that?  How could they not see what was coming?\"  \"The Guns of August\" answers these questions, and when the situations are examined up close and personal, it's clear that the men running Europe made about as reasonable, logical, and cautious decisions as can be made in wartime.  We have the luxury of not only hindsight, but of viewing the war as a whole.  In the middle of the war, a field officer knows only the battle around him and what information he receives from other officers.    Spread a rumor around your work or school, and in a single week see how distorted the rumor has become from the original one you spread.  Now pass a vital piece of information up and down lines of divisions and corps and armies during a full-fledged world war and see how great your communication is.      You don't need to be a military historian to follow this book.  There are maps to help the confused reader.  If there are wartime lessons to learn from the book, they are these:  remain strategically flexible, know your enemy, and plan for contingencies",

As his team goes on without him, they are doing quite well. They are making a championship run, and they are doing quite well, and they eventually get there. Before the big championship game, Chip was begging his coach to let him play. Chip's coach is not sure if Chip is  ready to play just yet, but Chip is by far the best athlete on the team. Will Chip get to play in the big game, or will he have to spend yet another game spectating from the bench.  I really enjoyed the book because it is very suspenseful, and it is hard to put down. It is suspenseful because throughout the book the author does not tell you Chips condition in its entirety, and whether or not he will get to play in the up coming games. There was on thing that I did not like about the book and that is the repetitiveness. It seemed like every time a big game was about to unfold, the same thing happened on the court. Also every time Chip asked his coach to play, he always said no, so you kind of almost expect it.   My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it is very well put together. Also if you are into sports or you like suspense and action, then you will probably love this book because it has all of these aspects.",

            "input": "There is yet more to learn about those old stories! . If you have a King James version of the Bible,  the next time you read Genesis, pay attention to how God is referred to.  Sometimes He's called \"God\" and sometimes He's called \"The Lord\".  The reason for this is that the original Hebrew text uses two different names for God, and the translators were careful to preserve this.  When the Hebrew text uses \"Elohim\" it is translated as \"GOD\".  When the Hebrew text uses \"Yahweh\", it is translated as \"The Lord\".    If you carefully read Genesis, you'll notice that when Genesis refers to God as \"Yahweh\", he seems to be very different than when he is refered to as \"Elohim\".  For example, Elohim is invisible--he never appears to anybody nor can he be seen by anybody--but Yahweh talks face-to-face with people all the time: with Abram, to Jacob, and to Moses and the 40 elders.  Elohim seems remote and regimented, whereas Yahweh comes across as mischevious and irrascible.  This has prompted some to propose the so-called \"Documentary Hypothesis\" which posits that Genesis was formed by editing together two or more different books, each book using a different word for God and each book presenting a different picture of who God was and what He was all about.      The book of J is the hypothasized book which used 'Yahweh\" as the name of God.  Scholars try to reconstruct this book by bringing together all of the passages in the first 5 books of the Bible which refer to God as \"Yahweh\".  The result is startling: the same stories you've heard all your life (The tower of Babal, Joseph going to Egypt, Abram bargaining with God over Sodom and Gomorrah), when read together like this, take on a whole different level of meaning.      This book provides two things in one handy volume: it provides a reconstruction of the book of J, freshly translated by David Rosenberg, and it also provides an extended commentary by Harold Bloom, who is certainly the best reader alive today, and who is uniquely qualified to serve as a tour guide through the experience of reading J.  So to review the book I'd like to review each of these seperately.    First, Rosenberg's translation.  To illustrate just how good it is at bringing things out of the text which you ordinarly wouldn't notice, I'd like to quote from his translation of the story of the Tower of Babal: \"We can bring ourselves together\" they said \"like stone on stone, use brick for stone: bake it until hard.\"  For morter they heated bitumen.    Notice how this translation brings out the parallelism between the tower of Babal and human society:  The tower is made out mud bricks bound by bitumen, and society is made out of people bound by language.  But people are also just made out of mud--recall the creation story where Yahweh breathes the breath of life into mud.  Baking the mud into bricks is symbolic of the people making themselves hard, and using bitumen for morter is symbolic of them using language and government to  organize themselves.   Rosenberg's translation makes available to us many of the puns and wordplay which other English translations unfortunately lose.    Now, to review Bloom's commentary.  Scholarly types are fond of dising Bloom for his tendency to be speculative, to use his imagination to illuminate the reading of the text.  But what they are forgetting is that J is a bunch of stories, written for us to experience!  To use an parable of Rorty's, its like a surgion describing your wife as a bunch of tissues and organs vs. describing your wife as  warm and loving, important person in your life. Yes, \"warm and loving\" arn't medical terms, but that doesn't make them a bad description of your wife.      Also, the very greatest literature, such as J is, will admit of more than one reading, more than one interpretation, more than one point of view.  Bloom here does us excellent service by showing us his point of view on the text, telling us how the experience of reading the text impacts him.  The author of J didn't write J just to chronicle some historical figures--the author of J wrote J so that we could read it, and by reading it, become changed into new people.  _This_ is the aspect of experiiencing J which Bloom's commentary helps along, and this is the aspect which critics of Bloom's commentary are missing the most",

However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book.  I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler.  There are many much better real estate investment books out there.    Some specific complaints:  * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems.  * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler.  * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet.  This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.)  * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there).  The book did not really touch on either of these topics.    That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting.  These are:  * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting.  * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it.  * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to  be during times when school is out.  * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase",

As David Catrow tells us in his introduction, \"...For me, the Constitution is a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort...\", and he uses his immeasurable talents as an artist and cartoonist to teach an inspirational and unforgettable lesson that is sure to open interesting discussions at home and school.  Following a glossary of what the actual words in the Preamble of the Constitution mean, (e.g. \"IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION:  To come together and make things better for everyone who lives in our country.  INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY:  To make sure we can all have a nice life and get along with one another.  TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY:  For kids, parents, other grown-ups, and all the people born in our country after we are.\"), Mr Catrow details the meaning of these important ideals, phrase by phrase, using his marvelously bold and busy cartoon illustrations.  Each two page spread is a clever feast for the eyes, rich in engaging details, manic energy, and droll humor.  Perfect for youngsters 8-12, We The Kids is a witty and memorable treasure, and one of the real winners of 2002 that shouldn't be missed",
