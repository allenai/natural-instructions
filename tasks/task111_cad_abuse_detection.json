An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) or Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) or Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) or Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.), indicate via \"yes\". Otherwise, response via \"no\".",

Got rejected from a 3D art school, and they pretty much took anyone so I felt like shit. At that point I had also been looking for employment for more than a year and i just kept getting rejected/no answer.    I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.     Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX.    You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.    Keep improving, keep applying, and approach recruiters on LinkedIn informally, have chats with them about future opportunities. They're a lot more friendly than most people realize ;)     Best of luck.",

This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \\*Counting On\\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.         This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes \"leghumping.\" Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. Some people believe positive observations (ex: Her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: Is it normal to eat casserole all the time? Yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so.         **Original Post**    [A regular user posted a meme aimed at leghumpers, people in the comments don't like being characterized as leghumpers, there is a fight about what constitutes leghumping](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/atypz2/the_leghumping_pests_infesting_this_sub/eh4f65x)         [The user then decides to leave the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au31u8/im_ready_to_move_on/)         [A different user creates a discussion themed subreddit to supplement the snark subreddit, snark fans tell him to leave](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au3ifq/rduggardiscourse/eh6knwl)         [The two main mods (one now deleted) attempt to clarify \"leghumping\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au5h9h/message_from_the_mods/eh5rlrg)         [A less active mod makes their own post (now deleted) to clarify \"leghumping,\" using a definition that allows positive comments and explaining to be posted.

There's also the issue where you can basically just go online and get an order for one, without ever really meeting or seeing the person who writes you a letter. I've seen some sites require a \"quick phone call\" and some that don't even require that.    Considering the benefits, I think ESAs are an overall great thing. Even though there are obstacles or issues that have come up, it's worth tackling them and trying to find solutions rather than abolish the program or hate them out of spite because some people abuse the program like the posters in the OP.    We can reduce \"ESA fraud\" if that's what we want to call it, but I think it's worth taking the effort to minimize harm to innocents while closing any loopholes or making changes to the program.     The university situation in particular is interesting. In a lot of dorms things are already cramped and diseases can spread quickly. It's not the healthiest space for humans physically, introducing animals into the situation seems like it could have big repercussions.     For the record I do have an ESA and I love them to bits. I've stopped taking two different medications for anxiety and depression and my physical health has reached surprising levels even to my other doctors and specialists.",

They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.    More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw). Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/brie-larson-basmati-blues-white-saviour-role-attack-criticism-actress-india-cinema-a8057001.html). Gotta pay those bills though, I guess.    The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.    The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels.

This equates to 641.4 mm. [...] Assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female U.S. crania, Oprah's head perimeter is 6.3 SD above the mean of American women.

[*\"IQ & fighting back against racism\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2014/11/15/iq-fighting-back-against-racism/):    >Oprah's 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the IQ to handle racists with style.

Martha Stewart began showing Oprah a very efficient way to maneuver a bed sheet, and asked Oprah to grap one corner of the bed sheet.

[...] Rather than trying to defend an awkward argument, Oprah had the cognitive adaptability to shift gears completely, by saying \"I wasn't trying to absurd, sir\" [...] Big brained Oprah then cleverly used her power which he did not have, by cutting to commercial break.    [*\"Big brained black billionaire\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/08/29/big-brained-black-billionaire/):    >A thousand years from now, when no one even knows who Oprah was, anthropologists might dig through the soil and discover a\u00a0skeleton with a colossal cranial capacity and assume it belonged to someone extremely intelligent.\u00a0 They'll\u00a0think it must have belong to some rare super human, perhaps a more evolved species.\u00a0 They\u00a0might then discover the\u00a0remains\u00a0of her\u00a0massive brick mansion and realize her intelligence allowed her to rule over the other humans of her time.

Eventually the kids moved out of the house.  She demanded that I remove them from my will.  She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way.  I was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money.    Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her.  I moved out and filed for divorce.    I have offered to give her everything.  The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  The cars that are paid off.  Every single piece of movable property.  All I want in return is my retirement.  I just want to be shut of her.  She refuses to respond to my offer.    She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied.  Denied but costly to the defendant.  If one stuck I would probably lose my job.    She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.    Her death would make everyone sad but our lives would improve immensely.",

He had every conceivable opportunity to unite China, his generals were some of the greatest talents in the land, many of his generals were said to be worth 1000 of men. (Guan yu, zhang fei, zhao yun, ma chao, huang Zhong) but he failed to follow through at crucial moments because how he would be seen by the people. Liu bei son A Dou or liu Chan was a completely useless emperor. He had no military experience due to him inheriting the empire during the three kingdoms deadlock( a time when wei, wu, and shy were already formed) so at the time no kingdoms risked massive battles because each kingdom was dug in defense wise.

You're the cancer that's eating away, I looked at America with envy since it allowed freedom of speech and expression, your bitch ass would cut into fucking pieces from the shithole I came from. You have no fucking clue how the world really is.         This retarded pandering to various genders, and this media bias and this oh my feelings are hurt are what's fucking you guys up.  You're all frustrated and cucked to the core.         And the mess you talk about? Do you even research, your stupid liberal policies, coupled with bombing the shit out of my people and waging endless wars have contributed far more, but you still don't get the blame for it since the countries left themselves wide open anyway.  The stronger rules the weak, that's how nature works. Embrace, understand it and learn from it.        Right now, you're nothing but a pawn being manipulated, you're talking to an outsider, who wants to protect America's interest since I see it as the last free standing country that has the balls to uphold values. Your freaking censorship, is killing the very thing that lets me vent out of my frustrations and view points.          Anyway, the point is, liberals and the far left are the lowest scums I know off. I was a semi liberal way back till I realized how wrong I was.        Trump 2020, he will unite the world and bring a much needed change.",

Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *Especially* for large animals.  I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting \"pet rent,\" an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.      ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most.    On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's.  I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs.  But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  My husband is allergic.  I am too, mildly though.  If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine.    We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/3FCkPSTc1Wooe39D6).  They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  My husband started to have an allergic reaction.  The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left.    Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  So, we left.  The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband.    I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions.  I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel.  I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her.      It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.  Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's?    Edit: fix words",

THE GOVERNING BODY RECOVERED SOME OF THE ORGANIZATION'S ASSETS BUT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER ALL OF THE DIVERTED FUNDS.  ON JUNE 28, 2018, THE ORGANIZATION AND THE TERMINATED OFFICERS HAD A MEDIATION WHERE THE TERMINATED OFFICERS AGREED TO RETURN THE DIVERTED FUNDS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME NOT TO EXCEED TEN YEARS.  IT IS THE ORGANIZATION'S ASSESSMENT THAT THE TERMINATED OFFICERS ARE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO IMMEDIATELY RETURN THE DIVERTED FUNDS; HOWEVER, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT ITS BEST CHANCE AT RECOVERING THESE FUNDS WILL BE TO ENFORCE THE AGREEMENT TO RECOUP THE DIVERTED FUNDS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.  THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT OTHER POSSIBLE METHODS OF RECOVERY, INCLUDING THE FILING OF A LAWSUIT, WILL RESULT IN FURTHER EXPENDITURES OF THE ORGANIZATION'S LIMITED FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR CRITICAL CRISIS SERVICE OF ITS TARGET POPULATION, THEREBY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION AND ITS DONORS' INTENT, AND WILL NOT RESULT IN A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY OF THE DIVERTED FUNDS.

Nobody has a problem with girl power. What people don't like is having girl power - or any agenda - shoved down their throats when they go to watch a movie about aliens and exploding spaceships. When some people dared to say so, they were - predictablty - attacked as misogynists and racists and incels and Nazis and whatever etc etc. So that blew the whole thing up before the movie was even released.    Then there was the whole thing about Rottentomatoes changing its entire site functions in order to protect the movie from a negative want-to-see score and later a negative audience review score.

We were only there together for an hour before everyone disappeared saying they all had things to do.

All of the people who we \"busy\" were all hanging out in the city.    All our \"friends\" left my best mates 17th to go hang out by themselves. After seeing this we both realised that they had been hiding their plans from us all week. Hiding their phones when in group chats just not talking to us about the party. They basically turned up for free paintball (which is expensive!!) And left for themselves.

That's not the point of my post. Basically, I enjoyed it. But now I'm starting to think she's actually into me romantically. She keeps talking about cuddling, and other cutesy stuff, and she's still being pretty sexually provocative. The problem is, if she is into me, the feeling isn't mutual, and I feel weird about doing anything because it's kind of a lie. I like her, but as a friend. I don't really want to have any kind of digital relationship, be it romantic or sexual, but that seems like what she wants. I don't want to just cut her off, but I don't really know what to do.

Net flows of capital from the global south to the global north are over six trillion a year. Yes that includes the foreign aid, the small pittance that you begrudgingly hand out and expect oh so much gratitude for.

My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.     All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July.    I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.    I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.    My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.    During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.    So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience).    Thank you for reading and I hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019",

Quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. I seriously want to know.    I don't know anyone who says that. It's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. Not everyone can appreciate light humour like Piano Cat while still enjoying Holocaust jokes. But hey, if you can, then you're probably insane.    That being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. Anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing.     >I feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive...    Yes. Again, yes. No one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac.

But that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less \"bad\" for them - as you said. Because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. They still have to live through it. They have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (Most?) People experience life subjectively. The limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. But it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. It's the same, felt, pain.

Writing it in a journal doesn't work because there's this desperate feeling for someone to know that you're suffering, while also such an intense shame and guilt about it that you can't tell your family or friends. So /r/offmychest gets a post.     At least in my experience, advice or sympathy don't really help and just make me feel worse. I feel the need to argue against it and say \"well I've tried that and it didn't work\" or shit like that, but feel like such a dick arguing against wellmeaning people that I just don't respond and end up deleting the post a few hours later anyway.     So just don't take it personally. A lot of times folks (or at least me) don't have an outlet and will spew their guts out to the internet because it's better than keeping it in. We aren't looking for advice or sympathy, there's just a depression/anxiety demon whispering in your ear and it often gets so loud that you just need to uncork your feelings to relieve a little pressure.

Both authors have very little credibility to be frank.    That having been said ... articles like this never acknowledge the good, they always zero in on what the author perceives as bad. They never seem to consider the father who (they claim) failed to do the things they are whining about had his own issues to deal with.     Case in point:    >Sexton, 37, grew up in Linton, a dirt-poor, factory-family town in southern Indiana, just southeast of Terre Haute.    Given that fact, and the fact there is a photo of Sexton and his (now crucified in public after his death) father at the Daytona 500 in 2007, and given that Nascar enjoys most of it's popularity amongst blue collar workers we can reasonably infer that Sexton's father was working in a factory in a struggling town.    Most likely working long hours, in a difficult job.    Yet these regressives never acknowledge that in their haste to virtue signal. They never acknowledge the burdens their fathers endured *for their children's sake* in their pursuit of a narrative which bears little relation to reality.",

So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted.    And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women.    And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy.    Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most.    In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around.    So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.     Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people.    Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it.      And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.",

My grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in Georgian Bay. This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did. My grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. When it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted.     Everything changed when my grandparents passed away.    My grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. So while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. It was nice closure. We all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. I don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. What I have an issue with is the constant stream of Instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. Recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. And there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. Seeing all of this makes me upset. They have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone.    I just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. Without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. How a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. I want to forget about this place, but I can't. I'm constantly being reminded of my grandparents and feeling huge waves of nostalgia.",

In a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting.     In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time.     In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying \"thanks for the advice!\" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like \"Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all\". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea.     All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying \"Thanks!\". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority.     In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax.

Super Eddie doing a pressor weeks ago about Jussie to give Foxx &Co. the option of saying Jussie was denied due process.  Super Eddie dose not go out without Mayor Rham telling him to.

He keeps his reputation of \"law and order\" intact and hits at Trump, keeping his left-wing cred intact.

All anyone has by way of proof are 2 screenshots and OPs word. Supposedly the CEO (or whatever, unsure if his title) answered in the thread- sort by controversial and it's like 3-10 comments down- but he *seems to* talk quite similar to OP.     I'm not saying that it's 100% that the op is lying but this looks, sounds, and **feels** really off to me and I think it bears watching. Though it may not matter as they're review bombing the business ([and review bombing the wrong business location in some cases](https://imgur.com/a/bKLaVNP)).That's super important as these are franchises, they don't own all the businesses that have that name. They've also ran them off almost every single social media platform they're active on.    Fwiw I've reported to the mods and they got back to me quickly and told me they'd take care of it. (I sent a pm w my report) Im trying to message the admins but I'm on the Reddit app and I'm unsure how to do that, or if there's even a \"contact admins\" button. I can't really blame the mods if they didn't know it was going on and that thread if a mammoth, it's huge.       Thoughts? Feelings? Ideas? Am I way off?    Edit: [a user claimed after they left their (fraudulent) review the store answered with this statement](https://imgur.com/a/wdLXv6b). Obviously made a while ago but I just missed it. They state a disgruntled ex employee hacked their insta and sent this. **My personal opinion** is that he \"hacked\" their insta (aka guessed the password) and did this himself. \"None would dare oppose us!

Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.     >    > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called \"Crimes Against Society.\" Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation.

One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen.

Both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.    The idea of Piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. Think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. The idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. Along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.    Where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is \"a number of people\". As we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. They may not even be a large portion at all. For example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on Steam. They're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. And they're using the fact they don't want to support the Epic Games Store as a moral excuse.     Essentially, they are valid points, assuming the \"lost sale\" defense is based in reality which I can't comment on. But a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. Instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.",

However, I do recognise that I might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then.    I went to a therapist back when I was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. She ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. I'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one I went to during my life. I went to one when I was 5, another one when I was 12 and another one when I was 14. Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).     Last year I thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (I got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but I couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so I couldn't do anything about it.

It feels as if I'm only a temporary friend, not one that lasts. This really gets me down lately. And to make things worse, I found out my best friend doesn't even care about me. I don't know why but since the start of the year, he has been different with me. He recently formed a new group of friends and slowly he has started to grow apart from me. I now know he doesn't care about me, but his still MY best friend. We used to talk everyday, now if he doesn't see me during school hours, he doesn't even send me a message. If I don't look up for him or talk to him, he just ignores me. I have come to think he grew tired of being my friend, as everyone I know. This always happens to me. Nevertheless, I still want his friendship and his approval, even when he has done me so many bad things. Some days it looks as if I'm really his best friend, but other days, he completely ignores my existence. It's just too much. I feel too much, and I always overthink too much. I try to talk to him but he just shoves me off. I'm just so tired of constantly feeling like a piece of garbage. Nobody really cares about me.",

I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse.    Something clicked  a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away.    Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it. But i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up!    Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. Just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. But a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good!    Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself!    Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.      Sorry if this is braggadocious, im just really proud of how far ive come! :)        P.S. if anyone has any tips on eating clean then please help me out! Anything is appreciated :)",

When I'd be with a friend group I would be there just to feel comfortable and all that. There's so much more I wish I could explain but someone knows my account smh. Anyways, ALL YOU NEED to know is that change starts when you start loving yourself again. Throw everything you heard about yourself away and start to think positively about yourself. Even if it's just looking at a mirror and thinking \"yea I'm good looking\" or anything that's up bringing DO THAT, it may feel super weird and so promise it's gonna b me weird for a while cuz it still is for me and all that but it does change. I'm a completely different person from what I was around 4 months ago. I have confidence now and it's amazing. I can walk up to people and actually talk. Every change starts with yourself. It may be cringe in the beginning to compliment yourself but doing this is something amazing that everyone feeling low should acquire.

I do not like the current fad of releasing remakes and remasters of everything, especially in Nintendo consoles. Additionally, I am not a fan of Nintendo's practices of charging double the price for ports than you see on other consoles (Skyrim costs twice as much on the Switch than on the PS4/XBOX, the new Final Fantasy ports are apparently all at least 40\u20ac).    I am certainly not the only person who thinks this, because it is not the first time I see threads and comments being showered with replies that can be summed up to 'shut up and accept it' and flurries of downvotes.    Some of us do not need to relive our childhood, teenagehood or whatever with constant remakes or remasters. Some of us would like new original content or sequels. But since most people keep buying these, companies have realized they can have more profit with half the work by remaking, remastering and re-releasing these games with special edition instead of focusing on other, different projects. This is what gives us stuff like Pok\u00e9mon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later.    I am not trying to attack eventual posters that identify with this mindset I am disagreeing with. There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much. And that is what some of us want to voice their disapproval over, but can't because the downvote brigade rains down on dissent.

I made the mistake of telling them this when they were yelling at me about wasting my time and being lazy and getting bad grades and I'm not shitting you my dad told me \"well if you're gonna be lazy and just waste space in the world you might as well do it.\" I'm not even doing that poorly. I have all A's and a B. And the B is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard.     And they actually asked me *why* I'm suicidal. I just fucking am I can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. Then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says \"because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and I didn't tell anyone I just attempted but failed,\" and then turns back to me and says \"what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?\" Like I'm sorry I'm losing the My Life is Hard competition but I can't just stop feeling like this.

All of this was after a like glorious  2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit.    I'm so hurt and starting to think I can't be around them anymore.

Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person.    Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like \"you're not really X\" or \"you're fake and a troll\". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub.    Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.    So, disagree with me on this if you must, but I think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim I'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything I've written.",

The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa.    This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that \"nobody supports them except those in the group\" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.     I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses \u2014 find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that \u2014 it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.    ^just to be clear, this is in a generic \"you\", I'm not accusing you of any of this    > hit in the head with a baton or bat    I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation.    > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does.    But in order for this to be at all relevant \u2014 you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked?    I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions.    > The difference between supporting assholes.    Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child?        People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

            "input": "A little story time. Who's up for some context?!    This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way.    One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her \"Jill.\" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman.    Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started.    Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke.    The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other.    She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. \"I missed talking to you,\" \"It feels like it's been so long since we talked,\" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. \"I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck.\" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just \"No you're not\" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that.    I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* \"You know I have a life outside of you, right?\", but then again... maybe I should've?    Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (\"I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that\") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago.    Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on.    Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while.    Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social.    Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her \"Claire\") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say \"hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon.\"    She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, \"Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year.\"    So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating.    TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.",
