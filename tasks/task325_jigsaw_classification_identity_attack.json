Instead, they parked away from the scene and sneaked up on him. Were they hoping for a shoot out? The first time he realized the cops were there was when he heard someone shout \"gun!\" (Hubbard actually walked around the apartment to confront him from behind.) Because they parked away from the scene, there is no video evidence to show whether or not Rodriguez was complying with their orders. That lack of video evidence also made it more likely the prosecutor could get an indictment from a grand jury with just the cops' (questionable) testimony.\nChief Kerns should be fired unless he gets rid of the rogue cops on his force.",

CIAA proposed moving the net pens to deeper water favored by most of the community.  The local ADF&G biologists, in callous disregard for all non-consumptive park users, forced the headwaters location.  Unbelievable.  \nIn Alaska, bearing the brunt of global warming, both Senators  Koch Murkowski and Ohio Koch Sullivan just voted to roll back methane emissions for oil and gas wells.  Not a mention in the BP fueled local paper.  How can two senators from the arctic deny climate change and stand behind Rex (Exxon)Tillerson?   How could Alaska pump $10Billion annually in oil and pay the oil companies?  Because every politician is a whore for an oil company handout.",

The original issue here is that you claimed Ed has gang tats, I corrected you...and instead of saying \"Oh, my bad\" or simply not replying, you chose to become defensive and argumentative, and change the subject. Then, when I called you out on the fact that you don't seem to even know what \"media bias\" means, you continued to be defensively argumentative. Definitely not the sign of an intelligent debater.

So I'm not sure why these articles seem to keep suggesting that people are not valuing the Arts degree.  Obviously many students still want it.  I got my Computer science degree MANY years ago and today I try to help others get into it.  And believe me, it is a lot harder to convince them to do comp sci than Arts or humanities related.  Incidentally, the USA still believes much in Liberal Arts.  Their degrees allow for much more room to take none core arts/humanities electives and I find American companies much more willing to hire Liberal Arts-type students wanting a more rounded individual (that's just my perception, maybe not reality).

Be ready; if his actions up to this point are any indication, you've got a very busy few months ahead of you.  May I repeat, no one needs to defame Mr. Trump.  His actions and comments are self-defamatory far beyond what anyone else could inflict.\n\nIndeed, he is \"striking a chord\" and it's a terribly discordant one.  Fewer and fewer individuals are supporting him as he continues to insult his way to a likely landslide defeat in November.  When that happens (as it very likely will) please don't blame the \"liberal media\" or those terrible people who were so \"biased\" against him.  Instead, blame the GOP for nominating him and blame him for being the worst Presidential candidate in our history.",

When TAPS had just under 2 million barrels of throughput- at about $9 dollars per barrel, was that more, or less value, than TAPS (currently) running at about 540,000 barrels per day at $48 dollars per barrel (or more)?\n\n$18 million per day... versus  $25.9 million per day (currently).\n\nHuh.

I am a former New Yorker and Trump was not admired in NYC , only to himself, he pulled the same stunts he does as president by all his lies and created illusions. Trump lost the state of NY and NYC by over a 20% points, if NY state is not feeling the love for their home grown boy what does that say? It was so odd for a candidate in a presidential election not to carry his own state I had to look up for Trump's counter parts who did not carry their own states either.

Canada is the system most like what I would call 'Medicare for All'....taxes pay for private health care. Of course one of the real issues with private health care is the growth in costs, over paid specialists, uneven access for rural/under served, and the lack of real measures of efficacy.  We spend too much treating conditions that are preventable...it's a real issue of responsibility. That said, this letter is Faux News-ish at it's best. Death panels, fear and loathing, and misinformation in the guise of argument. No person should ever best forced to let their child die, yet this happens too often in the US because of our stupid system of health-I-don;t-care.

But his contract is favourable over PKs. \n\nIf this Roster does in fact need a full rebuild, then Price needs to be let go to UFA and not be extended. The problem with that is Fucale was supposed to be Price's replacement and he's not even an AHL goalie let alone a future NHLer. Once Price goes, we will see just how bare the cupboard really is. Bergevin has been just as bad a GM as the guy he replaced in that he's done not myuch of anything to build the talent pool up. He has traded away picks trying to plug gaping holes that Price has been hiding from Habs fans",

To my mind, it's unjust to lay any of this at her doorstep. For political reasons, she can't come out and say it, but the fact is she was victimized by her husband. Yes, she publicly supported him (as many spurned political wives do), but there is no credible evidence supporting the notion that she was complicit in punishing the women he had relationships with.\n\nFor Trump to blame her is not only unjust but extremely foolish from a political perspective.

Ugly, costly, controversial and probably not the best.....but now we own it even though it is not done. It will provide an alternative for people who chose to ride it instead of driving their car for 2 hours one way each day. It probably won't reduce auto traffic, and this was said early-on. It just provided an alternative mode of transport.  Of course, some years ago, we were sold the \"second city\" which was supposed to be not only the new residential area on Oahu, but also the new employment area which, up until now, has not fulfilled that unfortunate prediction, although in years to come, no doubt, there will be employment and business growth in Ewa, Leeward, Central and the North shore.",

Though the recent recession has certainly hit many families hard, it is also clear that most people do not understand the basics of managing personal finances. Home economics classes taught students how to open bank accounts and how to balance a checking account and the difference in debit cards and credit cards.\nAll of this is real-life knowledge and skills that is crucial to \"success\".  Many believe that the modern state of millions of households would be vastly improved if people were taught at a young age how to manage their money, shop, cook (instead of eating out) and manage a household.

After the last few season's under UAA's worst coach of all time--Matt Thomas--he's worried about the tender feelings of his players concerning the numbers they wear ? Not only should these losing players have no choice in they're numbers--their names should be removed from the back as do many teams who believe it's all about team--not the player himself. The UAA hockey team has let down their school and given Alaska hockey a bad name. And we are to worry about what these players care about in their past ? Give me a break !  It costs the school more money to make the jersey with more than one single number on it. Two numbers makes the jersey weigh more , slowing the player on the ice. Instead of Woody reporting on the story UAA feeds him , why doesn't he pretend to be a real reporter and ask real questions ? Does Thomas feel he should have been fired after his worst winning record in D I hockey ? Will he resign if this season is just as bad ? Come Woody !  Man up !",

Since then, this unholy creation has used the military power of governing systems to torture, slay, and beat humans into submission.  All the while claiming purity of soul and body with caring and compassion.  The dark side of this monolith continues today through brainwashing and physical assault by self-created messengers of a non-existent, invisible being.

The latter means a bail bondsman puts up a bond for you (for which he will mulct you dearly).  Usually, the defendant in felony cases is required to post at least 10% of his total bail amount in cash.  The article doesn't say whether the $2,500 was the whole bail, or only the cash part.",

Opposition parties are getting political mileage everyday Zuma remains in power and everytime the ANC caucus fails to vote against him the votes of no confidence. There best chance of retaining power in 2019 is to remove Zuma now, as this will effectively end Dlamini Zuma's campaign, they can unite around Rhamaposa and focus on the ANC 2019 campaign. Do analsyts not see this, or do they really believe that ANC MPs are too politically naive not to see this?\n\nNo one of significance in the ANC is going to openly admit that Zuma might lose this vote, or that voting Zuma out is in the best interest of the ANC.

His ex-wife has also claimed that Ulukaya stole the yogurt receipe from a European yogurt company by bribing one of the company employees.\nTwin Falls is where there have been two incidents of rapes being committed by Moslem refugees.

The second rape involved a 28 year old Moslem male who raped a mentally disabled white woman in August, 2016.\nInterestingly, these rapes have been downplayed by the Mayor and the police in Twin Falls, possibly due to the influence of Ulukaya and the growing number of Moslem refugees.

He claimed: \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\" \n\nIt's a pretty easy lie to make: Cut taxes (who doesn't love tax cuts?!), then complain that we can't afford to fund programs the cuts paid for. Wash, rinse, repeat until that baby is dead in the tub. Anyone wanting to argue that this isn't beyond the pale - look at how Trump is deliberately sabotaging Obamacare, messing with peoples lives, just so he can slap his name on some kind of replacement.

That use to be one of the many white privileges that white men had. Lynchings are no longer considered family entertainment. There are photos.

Facebook apparently has ad categories such as:\n*Jew Hater\n*How to burn Jews\n*History of why Jews ruin the world\nReally.\nWell, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you!\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.",

Since MFs dominate ETFs by a factor of ten to one, why not apply the fear to a much bigger share of the investing world?\n\nAnd by talking about a bundle of bonds in an ETF fund that masks the bad ones with the good ones -- just to draw an analogy to mispriced MBS -- makes it more ridiculous, because the bond rating services were responsible for treating the overall tranche without looking at the components in the ratings given to them. Deliberate and malicious incompetence, since the providers took out insurance to cover the losses on the products they fobbed off to the MBS purchasers, who suffered real losses from the mis-rating and had no cover.\n\nLousy analogy.",

If they are undocumented they are criminals who broke the law by entering this country and not doing so the lawful way. It is estimated there are close to 8000 illegal criminal immigrants here in Alaska alone. Close to 600 of the criminals have a business. To even get a business they had to break even more laws. If all the immigrants made 1.8 billion dollars and after taxes have 1.4 billion they are also lying as most  people are taxed about a third of their income. I have no problem with those who are here legally but the criminals should be deported. Does it say anywhere how much welfare and handouts are taken from the Taxpayer(Working People) and given to them? Why would anyone want to create a path for known illegal criminal immigrants to stay in OUR Country? That is totally absurd. Does it say how many crimes are committed by all the immigrants?

It's depressing that so many still hold on to these very old and very destructive faith-based ideas.",

Bill will do that by locking up the Demo superdelegates, across the nation, including Hawaii and Bill and Hillary should get such a commitment again for large number of Demo superdelegates to back Hillary, then it does NOT matter who gets the democratic nomination, Hillary will be the defacto 2020 Democratic nominee.  In that case Trump should run again for another term as even with his Russian-gate problems, he would still win the electoral college against Hillary in 2020.  Too bad the Demo are not strong enough to just say NO when it comes to Bill and Hillary.  Plan B with Bill & Hillary might be to push their daughter Chelsea to run in 2020 instead of Hillary that even they themselves might actually admit she is too toxic.",

In a similar incident when a (white) man threatened me in front of my children and then tried to block me in with his car I reacted by leaping out and shouting and swearing, it was pure adrenaline and instinct, and it worked for me, it scared the man away. Not one onlooker scolded me for my language, because I am white. They immediately assumed I was under attack & came to help me.

I'm not surprised that the city has failed to find a 'suitable' place for the camp; after all it's failed time and time again to negotiate a move for Right to Dream Too.

The reason the city is unable to figure this out is that NIMBYs and \"undeserving poor\" spewing crybabies are always going to oppose *any* proposed location / relocation.  So it has to be done w/o permission and survive on community support & direct action.  The fact is that R2d2 was declared an illegal campground a long time ago.  Too bad, so sad, but it's been politically impossible to enforce that immoral law for even longer.

At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner. \n\nOn average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

Some Canadians ask themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? \n\n3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)",

They can be on you from 50-60 yards in a matter of seconds.                I saw 1 in attack mode on a moose once It was f*^:king frightening!            I don't know anymore than anyone else but we try to stay in groups of 3-4 I feel safe with guns an spray.     They seem to be on a rampage this year use care and be aware",

I like Trevor and I like Paxton. I appreciate that you can understand Lynch still can develop. I just have to defend Paxton from all of these idiots who don't understand what development takes. He certainly hasn't exceeded expectation. But these people who think Trevor is head and shoulders above Paxton are delusional.

Converting the rail guideway to a dedicated bus lane would be the equivalent of getting a job at Starbucks after you spend six figures getting a law degree at Harvard.

It can operate with as little as 90 second headways (40 trains per hour) with each train carrying up to 800 people. Additionally, since it will be driverless, the operating costs will be 20-30% cheaper than an at-grade rail system and 50-65% cheaper than a bus system. BRT systems, like at-grade light rail can carry 5,000-8,000 people per hour per direction and the biggest single operating cost item is the drivers.  Grade-separated high capacity rail systems are hands down the most efficient way to move large numbers of people, but they are very expensive to build (capital costs).

Some were conquering, some built massive structures and large infrastructure works , others were nomadic.

Most adapted to new technologies, whether horses or guns, etc, and modified their societies accordingly. Sadly, what they couldn't fight was germs and diseas, which wiped 90% of them out.\n\nBut to suggest their innovations and culture don't live on is silly.

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true. So I just want to apologize let u know that I understand now.I am sorry that you have to still encountr ignorance",

Some priests are very queer in affect but would never consider themselves homosexual. There is no reason not to ordain them or any gay man or married man or gay woman or married woman. It’s not a doctrinal issue. It has nothing to do with abuse and everything to do with Trad prejudice. The generation that insisted on that prejudice is dying out.

They are, after all unconstitutional.  As to work ethic...blacks have double the unemployment rate as whites...due primarily to lack of education/training/experience.  Perhaps your \"leaders\" should be concentrating on improving the work force, rather than keeping them enslaved on the \"gummint\" plantation as a victim voting block!!  You assume other races can't be \"poor\"?  And, I think many coming from Europe were the best and brightest.

He never once on Facebook, Twitter or texting said he hated gays. The fact he chose the nightclub for his attack was, in all likelihood, because he knew the nightclub inside and out: the doors, windows, exits, etc. And he knew there would be a lot of people to kill there.  The terrorist declared his support for ISIS and never once mentioned gays. However the regressive-left 'liberals' refused to accept the facts.",

Age of the child is not the important part, it is only an attempt by church officials to nit pick.  Rape is Rape, no matter what the age.  It is statutory  rape for an adult to have even consented sex with a minor.  There is a bit of a problem when one person is 17 and the other is 18 and that is why sometimes the whole situation must be taken into consideration.

Moreover, the interest was increased by three other factors: (1) a stronger Canadian dollar increasing the comparative value of salaries and research dollars for equipment largely priced in foreign currencies, (2) lower housing costs in major cities, and, for parents, (3) good, internationally competitive public schools, that didn't require them to consider expensive private schools.

It just shifts the most expensive option to the next longest set of appeals.   Appeals will always be exceedingly costly and any defendant that uses their full allotment of appeals for any conviction can run up a staggering bill.

Trump got elected in large measure because the Democrats are little better than Republicans( and worse in some aspects) when it comes to economic issues faced by your average voter. As a matter of fact, a number of well-knowns have made the case that Richard Nixon was our last truly \"liberal\"( you know, supporting all the good domestic stuff, Watergate excepted) president.

As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church.

Trump does represent a certain kind of masculinity--the kind that can't get it's needs met through its own merits but gets its needs met through the crutch called male privilege. Trump types are so unattractive physically, emotionally and socially that they can't get their sexual needs met in the normal way--on the open market in an equal exchange. They require the black market of sexual harassment and rape. Trump types only get sex when they buy it or by forcing themselves on attractive women who always reject them because they are so grotesque. Let's face it. Real men get what they want by having something to offer. Money can only buy sex from people who prostitute themselves. These are the only women who would have sexual relations with a Trump or a Trump type. Trump will always be a john.",

Because both sides are kinda absurd. \nEugene consistently creates an awkward if  not hostile environment for homegrown, or at least West Coast businesses, tiny, small, large or whichever. My peanut gallery comment applies to both sides, both sides means right wing and left wing. Of course the reality is different than right versus left.  For example, just one among perhaps hundreds, the restriction on the size of signs a downtown business may display before paying an exorbitant fee. The work around for this is easy enough, but it's still a Pain.  Don't get me started on the plastic bag ban.  It makes sense in cities next to large bodies of water, such as the oceans, or the Great Lakes. But Not Here. The plastic bags have a much better reuse life span and are more frequently reused. I think the ban on dogs downtown is stupid. It's policy theater. What next, cat leash laws? Reear!!",

One needs to pre-manage these expected bouts of frustration. Before next Monday's game discover the location of the home of the coach most responsible for the expected nationwide humiliation. Then midway through the game whilst the imbecile is making one derisory decision after another, simply pack-up the family into the car, pop over to his estate and execute his dog. Then it's off to Applebee's or some other franchised eatery for lighthearted discussions about upcoming holidays and school activities. When anger is dealt with by a brief and proportional act of unbridled violence followed quickly by a wholesome activity it almost always gives rise to closure and an emotionally healthy individual.

Then you would accept a lot of downside from issues (maintenance, external factors, bad tenants)and it would make it a poor investment vs alternatives. You obviously don't understand there is a bond market that has far less downside with a better pay out ratio. Or are just ignorant and maybe this is going way over your head.\n\nSo yes any smart person who buys and rents out property does it as part of housing speculation.

Ever since the draft was eliminated and all of the wages and benefits were made comparable or better than the private sector, they have operated as an arm of the Military Industrial Complex to suck as much revenue from the nation's working people as possible.  The feudal structure allows absolute dictatorship for Generals living in opulent splendor and never accountable for failure. Most recently, too many are now traitors in league with Russia.

There is no cherry-picking involved here.\n\nFurthermore, you presume a lot when you accuse me of having been raised with homophobia. I have never been afraid of people who claim to be homosexual.

The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA.

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

She walked across to the left to be facing them, appropriately, and was therefore on Trump's side of the stage (just calling it that because of the setup). When the camera was switched to that side of the stage so as to show Clinton face-on it appeared that Trump was behind Clinton facing her back. I don't think he even moved from his chair location. She moved over to be in front of him to address that side of the audience. There was no sneaking up behind her by Trump.

It is pretty much inevitable that over time, this will occur for a high risk project like this.  There is no way to clean this nasty product up.  Nope, it isn't oil in the conventional sense! Given the silt in the river, the bitumen will sink when the spill occurs.  This is proven.  As if that weren't enough to shelve the project, there is no long term market for this low grade product.  The extra dollar or two per barrel that might be obtained breifly shipping by pipeline versus rail is not worth the risk.  Due to the coming lower demand for fossil fuels in general, \"flooding\" of the world market with this low grade heavy crude will only serve to drive its price down, so ironically, the price may end up even lower than what would be obtained by shipping it by rail.  Please stop this project and all this nonsense!!",

Haley's threat is more Trumpian big body.  The big problem is that Trump and his people simply do not understand diplomacy and Geo-political realities.  No doubt Trump's dissing and self-serving and grotesquely open refusal to give credibility to US intelligence work and information adds to this ignorance.  Understand this.  Under TRUMP, we are squarely at risk for war on the Korean penninsula.  China and Russia have clearly expressed their problem with that approach.

If women actually are seen as representing God then men are really not 'separate but more equal', which is what their identity has largely been built on. They are actually then 'less equal' in their own eyes because they can't give birth.

It seems obvious to me that white law professors that are ignorant about the role of white racism in every aspect of American life, including our justice system, contribute to us not having equal protection under the law. Of course, it is hard to see a problem when you are the beneficiary of that problem. Or maybe, equal protection under the law is just another white privilege. Most white folks seem happy with the situation. They think being polite and respectful to black people is like being lynched. BTW, the GOP wants to go back to the original Constitution.

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say \"Islam\" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.

Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.\n\nWhen Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.\n\nNO on M103.

You just hear/see it most often on campuses than in the real world. I agree campuses could bear the label of \"Alcohol Culture\" but then so could large parts of society.\nI think it is could for women to take some self-defence courses. I do worry that TV and movies will cause them to believe that an average women can easily demolish a muscular man half again her weight. When I took a course I got the best piece of advice you could ever get - the first line of defense is running not fighting. After that I think women's biggest weakness in a fight is that most of us have never been punched for real and that first time it happens it shocks you so much you freeze. So practically the best advice I can give is: learn to run, learn to take a punch. And when you decide to run just leave your stuff behind - you can always get a new bag and new id.",
