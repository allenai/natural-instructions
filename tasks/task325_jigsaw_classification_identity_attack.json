The first time he realized the cops were there was when he heard someone shout \"gun!\" (Hubbard actually walked around the apartment to confront him from behind.) Because they parked away from the scene, there is no video evidence to show whether or not Rodriguez was complying with their orders.

Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there.

CIAA proposed moving the net pens to deeper water favored by most of the community.

Unbelievable.  \nIn Alaska, bearing the brunt of global warming, both Senators  Koch Murkowski and Ohio Koch Sullivan just voted to roll back methane emissions for oil and gas wells.  Not a mention in the BP fueled local paper.  How can two senators from the arctic deny climate change and stand behind Rex (Exxon)Tillerson?

This can be used to refer to sexual abuse of persons who are differently-abled, a child, or an elder person. \"  So \"petting\" may constitute criminal sex abuse under certain circumstances...although the story doesn't reference \"petting\"; it refers to \"touching her genitals\" ....which, under the circumsances of \"non-consensual\", would likely qualify as sexual abuse...obviously, the police and DA's office determined the incident qualified....from this point, it's up to the court system",

Real classy those conservatives are. \n\nIf the conservative thinks government employment is so lucrative, he or she had ample opportunity to obtain one of those \"high paying, awesome benefits\" jobs.

For example, just Google UBC faculty enrollment statistics (I went to UBC) and the Arts faculty is the largest by far, about 25% larger than other faculties.  So I'm not sure why these articles seem to keep suggesting that people are not valuing the Arts degree.  Obviously many students still want it.  I got my Computer science degree MANY years ago and today I try to help others get into it.  And believe me, it is a lot harder to convince them to do comp sci than Arts or humanities related.  Incidentally, the USA still believes much in Liberal Arts.  Their degrees allow for much more room to take none core arts/humanities electives and I find American companies much more willing to hire Liberal Arts-type students wanting a more rounded individual (that's just my perception, maybe not reality). With co-op, yeah many University degrees are job factories!",

But his contract is favourable over PKs. \n\nIf this Roster does in fact need a full rebuild, then Price needs to be let go to UFA and not be extended. The problem with that is Fucale was supposed to be Price's replacement and he's not even an AHL goalie let alone a future NHLer. Once Price goes, we will see just how bare the cupboard really is. Bergevin has been just as bad a GM as the guy he replaced in that he's done not myuch of anything to build the talent pool up.

Judge Gleason, based on \"discovered\" internal BP documents, told the state (2006 TAPS valuation trial) that it was \"too trusting\" in dealing with oil companies and their promises (instead of contracts) of \"more\" or \"new\" production and \"revenue for the state\", if only they were given massive up-front tax breaks and subsidies. They hire the best in the world to get that done. \n And this legislature is helping them get it done.  One of the BP \"internal documents\" that w discovered in a state/BP tax trial, stated that their Alaska leases would be wildly profitable to at least 2065, and that was EVEN if MO MORE new oil was ever discovered!   It`s time to end Meyer`s \"crapshoot\" SB21, and end the billion a year in cash credits they have extorted from the state each year going forward.

Yes, she publicly supported him (as many spurned political wives do), but there is no credible evidence supporting the notion that she was complicit in punishing the women he had relationships with.\n\nFor Trump to blame her is not only unjust but extremely foolish from a political perspective.

Many people do not believe sexual preference constitutes race. It has not been proven people are actually born gay and therefore ARE technically a race of people by DNA etc. What the law has done in business is to create a war in the workplace. The pecking order works like this: Gay women create cliques and take over the business. Straight women are second class citizens. People of color (gay or not) are 3rd class citizens.

I had forgotten what was being said in 1970 about Oahu's lack of alternatives to the automobile. Well, the alternative is HART. Ugly, costly, controversial and probably not the best.....but now we own it even though it is not done. It will provide an alternative for people who chose to ride it instead of driving their car for 2 hours one way each day. It probably won't reduce auto traffic, and this was said early-on. It just provided an alternative mode of transport.  Of course, some years ago, we were sold the \"second city\" which was supposed to be not only the new residential area on Oahu, but also the new employment area which, up until now, has not fulfilled that unfortunate prediction, although in years to come, no doubt, there will be employment and business growth in Ewa, Leeward, Central and the North shore.",

The Scots are a proud people and they did not want to exit the EU, but were forced because of the strength of the union.  They do not like it, and if they wish to take action as a result of once again being trumped by England, it's nobody's business but theirs.   Let the Scots vote and think for themselves and if the majority wants to separate and take their destiny into their own hands, so be it.

It's easy to talk when it doesn't affect your pocketbook. Now they're saying that certain buildings got to have sprinklers installed. Did they take into consideration about all the cost that is going to be incurred. Installation of sprinklers means they got to cut the walls, ceilings & etc. Now they also have to deal with asbestos & lead paint. These cost will bankrupt a lot of owners. Another stupid law by our MAYOR. Out of all this mess, I'm glad that I'm in my own house & not living in one of these condos. I really feel for the condo owners that is caught up in this mess.",

In some minds it means \"excessive compared to the bail usually set for similar charges.\"  In others, it means \"excessive compared to the defendant's resources.\"  Usually, the court considers both.\n\nPeople also don't realize that there is a distinction between cash bail and \"corporate\" bail.  The latter means a bail bondsman puts up a bond for you (for which he will mulct you dearly).  Usually, the defendant in felony cases is required to post at least 10% of his total bail amount in cash.  The article doesn't say whether the $2,500 was the whole bail, or only the cash part.",

Hashmi implies that Trump can solve the problem to allowing Muslims to immigrate from Myanmar.  That, of course, would be INSANE.  Islamic countries should take in such immigrants.

Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?  That certainly isn’t Christ-like, being as that Christ admonished everyone to “sin no more.”  You are the obstinate bigot here, clearly.",

Or maybe the all Mexicans who come here are rapist, thieves, and drug dealers.  Certainly his recorder statement about his grabbing women stands by itself as indicative of his views on women.  Did sure you missed all those?",

If all the immigrants made 1.8 billion dollars and after taxes have 1.4 billion they are also lying as most  people are taxed about a third of their income. I have no problem with those who are here legally but the criminals should be deported. Does it say anywhere how much welfare and handouts are taken from the Taxpayer(Working People) and given to them? Why would anyone want to create a path for known illegal criminal immigrants to stay in OUR Country? That is totally absurd. Does it say how many crimes are committed by all the immigrants?

He has zero empathy and compassion for others and an overblown sense of self that I've never seen before. Other than all of that, sure, he's \"a good man.\"",

At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner. \n\nOn average, an African American man, woman, or child was hanged, generally by a white mob, once a week, every week between 1882 and 1930, as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians ask themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? \n\n3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)",

It can operate with as little as 90 second headways (40 trains per hour) with each train carrying up to 800 people. Additionally, since it will be driverless, the operating costs will be 20-30% cheaper than an at-grade rail system and 50-65% cheaper than a bus system. BRT systems, like at-grade light rail can carry 5,000-8,000 people per hour per direction and the biggest single operating cost item is the drivers.  Grade-separated high capacity rail systems are hands down the most efficient way to move large numbers of people, but they are very expensive to build (capital costs).

If you resent my offering that advice (which seems to be the case), feel free to ignore the advice and continue to engage in \"p#$%#ing matches\" with intoxicated homeless individuals.  But, please remember I, again with your safety in mind, suggest it's a very bad idea.  Good Luck, Gary Crum",

After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.\n\n\"In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.\" \n\nLisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.\n\nLisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.",

Appeals will always be exceedingly costly and any defendant that uses their full allotment of appeals for any conviction can run up a staggering bill.

It makes sense in cities next to large bodies of water, such as the oceans, or the Great Lakes. But Not Here. The plastic bags have a much better reuse life span and are more frequently reused. I think the ban on dogs downtown is stupid. It's policy theater. What next, cat leash laws? Reear!!",

For starters there are only about 4000 non-residents workers on the slope.  Many of their jobs are high paying.  Better question to ask is why don't we have the qualified Alaskans to fill those positions?  Oil companies are about profit and minimizing expense.  It is cheaper to hire a local work force than pay for airfare etc, except that the work force has to be qualified and apparently not enough Alaskans are.  I'm not sticking it to anyone nor am I giving anyone a pass on paying for state services.  Regardless of how you or I characterize the PFD our characterizations are irrelevant",

One needs to pre-manage these expected bouts of frustration. Before next Monday's game discover the location of the home of the coach most responsible for the expected nationwide humiliation. Then midway through the game whilst the imbecile is making one derisory decision after another, simply pack-up the family into the car, pop over to his estate and execute his dog. Then it's off to Applebee's or some other franchised eatery for lighthearted discussions about upcoming holidays and school activities.

Massive damage to critical organs increases the chances that the attacker will die.\nThe movie version of \"bang...fall down dead\" is a myth. As a poster wrote, the attacker in this story went to his uncle's apartment after suffering lethal wounds. That's more like reality.\nAs to immediate acting tranquilizers or some other disabling drug, where exactly would a person have to be hit for such a drug to act immediately? Under the stress of a deadly attack, would an officer be able to deliver the tranquilizing shot to just the right spot, assuming it is exposed in the first place?",

If the write-in candidate has not officially filed for a specific position, the name must be written as the exact spelling. Variations in name spellings will not count as a vote for that person.

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

Most Europeans have gotten past tying religion and politics.  If only we could.  God may not be dead, but she certainly has better things to do than hang out in the voting booth.  (Or kitchen table, as we fill out our mail-in ballots.)",
