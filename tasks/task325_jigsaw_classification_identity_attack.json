Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.\n\nOn the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.",

Unbelievable.  \nIn Alaska, bearing the brunt of global warming, both Senators  Koch Murkowski and Ohio Koch Sullivan just voted to roll back methane emissions for oil and gas wells.  Not a mention in the BP fueled local paper.  How can two senators from the arctic deny climate change and stand behind Rex (Exxon)Tillerson?

This can be used to refer to sexual abuse of persons who are differently-abled, a child, or an elder person. \"  So \"petting\" may constitute criminal sex abuse under certain circumstances...although the story doesn't reference \"petting\"; it refers to \"touching her genitals\" ....which, under the circumsances of \"non-consensual\", would likely qualify as sexual abuse...obviously, the police and DA's office determined the incident qualified....from this point, it's up to the court system",

So I'm not sure why these articles seem to keep suggesting that people are not valuing the Arts degree.  Obviously many students still want it.  I got my Computer science degree MANY years ago and today I try to help others get into it.  And believe me, it is a lot harder to convince them to do comp sci than Arts or humanities related.  Incidentally, the USA still believes much in Liberal Arts.  Their degrees allow for much more room to take none core arts/humanities electives and I find American companies much more willing to hire Liberal Arts-type students wanting a more rounded individual (that's just my perception, maybe not reality).

But his contract is favourable over PKs. \n\nIf this Roster does in fact need a full rebuild, then Price needs to be let go to UFA and not be extended. The problem with that is Fucale was supposed to be Price's replacement and he's not even an AHL goalie let alone a future NHLer. Once Price goes, we will see just how bare the cupboard really is. Bergevin has been just as bad a GM as the guy he replaced in that he's done not myuch of anything to build the talent pool up.

It has not been proven people are actually born gay and therefore ARE technically a race of people by DNA etc. What the law has done in business is to create a war in the workplace. The pecking order works like this: Gay women create cliques and take over the business. Straight women are second class citizens. People of color (gay or not) are 3rd class citizens.

I had forgotten what was being said in 1970 about Oahu's lack of alternatives to the automobile. Well, the alternative is HART. Ugly, costly, controversial and probably not the best.....but now we own it even though it is not done. It will provide an alternative for people who chose to ride it instead of driving their car for 2 hours one way each day. It probably won't reduce auto traffic, and this was said early-on. It just provided an alternative mode of transport.  Of course, some years ago, we were sold the \"second city\" which was supposed to be not only the new residential area on Oahu, but also the new employment area which, up until now, has not fulfilled that unfortunate prediction, although in years to come, no doubt, there will be employment and business growth in Ewa, Leeward, Central and the North shore.",

The Scots are a proud people and they did not want to exit the EU, but were forced because of the strength of the union.  They do not like it, and if they wish to take action as a result of once again being trumped by England, it's nobody's business but theirs.

Make a big one ot two room shelter, (think quonset hut) supply a bed and warm place to sleep. Supply a meal or two that is adequate to survive. Supply a shower and laundry facilities.

Did they take into consideration about all the cost that is going to be incurred. Installation of sprinklers means they got to cut the walls, ceilings & etc. Now they also have to deal with asbestos & lead paint. These cost will bankrupt a lot of owners.

In some minds it means \"excessive compared to the bail usually set for similar charges.\"  In others, it means \"excessive compared to the defendant's resources.\"  Usually, the court considers both.\n\nPeople also don't realize that there is a distinction between cash bail and \"corporate\" bail.  The latter means a bail bondsman puts up a bond for you (for which he will mulct you dearly).  Usually, the defendant in felony cases is required to post at least 10% of his total bail amount in cash.  The article doesn't say whether the $2,500 was the whole bail, or only the cash part.",

Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?  That certainly isn’t Christ-like, being as that Christ admonished everyone to “sin no more.”  You are the obstinate bigot here, clearly.",

I have no problem with those who are here legally but the criminals should be deported.

In fact, assuming that such answers exist is typically a component of white privilege. \n\nBut white supremos also need a firm hand, since they are heavily armed, glorify war, and espouse violence, and worse, against Jews and people of color, which is illegal and dangerous.  This is why the AntiFa should cease trying to kick their butts and instead shame them through outing on FB, Instagram and in the press and such. Hold them up for the losers they are and they'll vanish.\n\nYou're not asking not a simple question. Both groups--the destitute and the white nationalists--need justice to be done. Own it: you despise the poor, favor the white supremos over civil rights and equality, and you associate being on the right side of history with the supposed moral quibbling of \"political correctness\".",

Lynchings continued until the 1950s, as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”",

While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians ask themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for Sharia law. \n\n2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? \n\n3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the \"white slave trade\". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)",

So, let me ask all you dotards and morons this simple question:  Can you please explain your desire to eliminate the capital gains tax and inheritance tax because they are  \"taxed twice\"?  I hope you're being consistent.   You also may also want to look at the states with the best economies. Yes, they are generally high tax blue states.  You morons always want to attribute high taxes to welfare, but high taxes (especially property taxes) are evident in states with the best infrastructure, health care, schools, and regulatory programs (like environmental protection).

It can operate with as little as 90 second headways (40 trains per hour) with each train carrying up to 800 people. Additionally, since it will be driverless, the operating costs will be 20-30% cheaper than an at-grade rail system and 50-65% cheaper than a bus system. BRT systems, like at-grade light rail can carry 5,000-8,000 people per hour per direction and the biggest single operating cost item is the drivers.  Grade-separated high capacity rail systems are hands down the most efficient way to move large numbers of people, but they are very expensive to build (capital costs).

After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Denying the self-determination of Jews in their historic homeland is anti-Semitic as it discriminates against Jews whereas self-determination of other cultures and religions are conferred upon them, just listen to the Palestinians, their leaders and supporters, who claim self-detemination for their people. Criticism is legitimate, however holding Israel in contempt and opprobrium and out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East, and claiming that Israel has no right to exist, is well beyond mere criticism.",

Moreover, the interest was increased by three other factors: (1) a stronger Canadian dollar increasing the comparative value of salaries and research dollars for equipment largely priced in foreign currencies, (2) lower housing costs in major cities, and, for parents, (3) good, internationally competitive public schools, that didn't require them to consider expensive private schools.

Appeals will always be exceedingly costly and any defendant that uses their full allotment of appeals for any conviction can run up a staggering bill.

This book will lay out for you in as close to laymens terms just what those studies you tout really said. You were lied to by Obama 1,000's of times and didn't care, lied to by Hillary and didn't care, lied to by the CDC now and don't care but in not caring you regrettably become the voice of the useful idiot parroting the misinformation that you have been fed. Answer this for me Gary: why does a 12 hr old child require a vaccination for HepB? The answer is that they don't. IN 1996 before the HepB vax was required at birth we had 872 adverse reactions to the vax, 48 deaths and only 279 reports of HepB in children under 14 yrs old. The vax presents a greater risk than the disease.. 1 of many",

Most of them want to go back to the good old days of the 1950's. Obama was the last straw for them. A black man was never supposed to be president. Science alone can't make sure that won't happen again. They can't bring back the white racist nation they miss. The only question is how many of the rest of us will they kill in their death throes. Principled conservatives need to find a new party. If they stay with the Republicans, they will own the white racist label that the rest of the GOP embraces. The GOP has spent the last 50 years recruiting white racists into the GOP. Now those white racists control the GOP. Sessions is living proof of the white racism in the core of the modern GOP, in the 21st century.",

Because both sides are kinda absurd. \nEugene consistently creates an awkward if  not hostile environment for homegrown, or at least West Coast businesses, tiny, small, large or whichever. My peanut gallery comment applies to both sides, both sides means right wing and left wing. Of course the reality is different than right versus left.  For example, just one among perhaps hundreds, the restriction on the size of signs a downtown business may display before paying an exorbitant fee. The work around for this is easy enough, but it's still a Pain.  Don't get me started on the plastic bag ban.  It makes sense in cities next to large bodies of water, such as the oceans, or the Great Lakes. But Not Here. The plastic bags have a much better reuse life span and are more frequently reused. I think the ban on dogs downtown is stupid. It's policy theater. What next, cat leash laws? Reear!!",

For starters there are only about 4000 non-residents workers on the slope.  Many of their jobs are high paying.  Better question to ask is why don't we have the qualified Alaskans to fill those positions?  Oil companies are about profit and minimizing expense.  It is cheaper to hire a local work force than pay for airfare etc, except that the work force has to be qualified and apparently not enough Alaskans are.

Because they think they are superior. \n\nObama the black imperialist will be gone soon. The question is will his replacement conduct the same kind of policy. The U.S. 7th Fleet is itching for a war with China. Mess up SE Asia like Middle East. Trump is itching for a war on Iran, make Israel happy. See war is how the West believe they can fix their economies.",

One needs to pre-manage these expected bouts of frustration. Before next Monday's game discover the location of the home of the coach most responsible for the expected nationwide humiliation. Then midway through the game whilst the imbecile is making one derisory decision after another, simply pack-up the family into the car, pop over to his estate and execute his dog. Then it's off to Applebee's or some other franchised eatery for lighthearted discussions about upcoming holidays and school activities.

Massive damage to critical organs increases the chances that the attacker will die.\nThe movie version of \"bang...fall down dead\" is a myth. As a poster wrote, the attacker in this story went to his uncle's apartment after suffering lethal wounds. That's more like reality.\nAs to immediate acting tranquilizers or some other disabling drug, where exactly would a person have to be hit for such a drug to act immediately? Under the stress of a deadly attack, would an officer be able to deliver the tranquilizing shot to just the right spot, assuming it is exposed in the first place?",

If the write-in candidate has not officially filed for a specific position, the name must be written as the exact spelling. Variations in name spellings will not count as a vote for that person.

However, Obama’s lifting of the ban on transgenders went much further than simply allowing them to serve.  The Obama administration recognized that transgenders suffer from a mental disorder called “gender dysphoria” and directed the military services to develop and implement plans to provide transgenders psychiatric and other medical care including sex reassignment surgery.  Under Obama’s policy, transgenders will spend much of their time on active duty being treated for a pre-existing condition.  That is transforming DOD into a social service organization.",

Many leaders did succeed in industry, agriculture and other avenues of progress, while others \"bought\" votes and perhaps by ignorance (or greed) did not invest or create.  Get off the reservation and be independent like the others you claim are getting \"pie\". Start focusing education on what is applicable for today's survival. The absolute WORST way is merely doling out money. It NEVER works. I am sure with you in regards to failing areas getting appropropriate education and help with infrastructure, but handing out money for personal expenditures for proven failed leadership? Hard working folks have no sympathy. Leaders signing contracts had no idea how misused that money would be from certain nations who spent it foolishly and now cry Victim.",

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say \"Islam\" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.
