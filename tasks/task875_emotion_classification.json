    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a sentence containing a particular emotion. You must classify the sentence into one of the six emotions: 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', or 'surprise'.",

    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "i am ever feeling nostalgic about the fireplace i will know that it is still on the property",
            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "The word \"nostalgic\" could either indicate \"love\" or \"sadness\", but the fact that it is still on the property eliminates \"love\"."
        },
        {
            "input": "i am feeling grouchy",
            "output": "anger",
            "explanation": "The word \"grouchy\" clearly indicates the emotion \"anger\"."

    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "i feel romantic too",
            "output": "joy",
            "explanation": "This statement clearly indicates joy, but the joy particularly relates to romance. So, the correct label must be \"love\" instead."
        },
        {
            "input": "i feel like i have to make the suffering i m seeing mean something",
            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "Since the author feels that he must find a purpose for the suffering, the sentence has a negative outlook. So, the label should be \"sadness\" and not \"love\"."
