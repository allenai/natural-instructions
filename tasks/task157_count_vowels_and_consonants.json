    "Definition": "In this task, you need to count the number of vowels (letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') / consonants (all letters other than vowels) in the given sentence.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sentence: 'a white cat on a desk near a computer monitor'. Count the number of vowels in the given sentence.",
            "output": "16",
            "explanation": "This sentence has 5 occurrences of letter 'a', 4 of 'e', 2 of 'i', 4 of 'o', and 1 of 'u'. This adds up to 16. So, the answer is 16."
