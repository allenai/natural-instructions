Link Information: Sandstones are clastic in origin (as opposed to either organic, like chalk and coal, or chemical, like gypsum and jasper).\nThey are formed from cemented grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic crystals. The cements binding these grains together are typically calcite, clays, and silica. Grain sizes in sands are defined (in geology) within the range of 0.0625 mm to 2 mm (0.0025–0.08 inches). Clays and sediments with smaller grain sizes not visible with the naked eye, including siltstones and shales, are typically called argillaceous sediments; rocks with larger grain sizes, including breccias and conglomerates, are termed rudaceous sediments.\n\nThe formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of sedimentation, either from water (as in a stream, lake, or sea) or from air (as in a desert). Typically, sedimentation occurs by the sand settling out from suspension; i.e., ceasing to be rolled or bounced along the bottom of a body of water or ground surface (e.g., in a desert or erg). Finally, once it has accumulated, the sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by the pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.

Before applicants could even enrol, he found out that the school had been sold from under him. He decided to continue the course independently, so he set up the London School of Film Technique in Brixton. The first filmmaking course started in April 1957. \n\nThe school was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Inspired by the emergence of film schools in Eastern Europe after World War II, it was set up around the belief that the future of the British film industry required properly designed formal training, rather than the apprenticeship basis which was, at the time, the only access into the field. At first, the school offered a 6-months diploma course which students could take over the day or evening classes, with an optional 6-months extension. Under the leadership of principal Robert Dunbar, the course was expanded to 33 weeks and later 2 years, forming the basic structure for a curriculum that is still largely in place today. \n\nThis caused a drastic increase in the student numbers, which made the original premises in Electric Avenue, Brixton, unsuited. The school moved to the West End in 1963, first into a building in Charlotte Street and later, in 1966, in its current premises on Shelton Street.

Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe. In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought a non-consecutive third term in 1880, as did Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 (though it would have been only his second full term). Both were unsuccessful.\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the self-imposed precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\n\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, president when this term limit came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term—to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term—before he withdrew from the 1952 election.\n\nSince the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Both Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of John F. Kennedy's unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but he withdrew from Democratic Primary. Additionally, Gerald Ford, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, sought a full term but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election.

Link Information: The well-known foundation legend of Santa Maria del Popolo revolves around the evil memory of Emperor Nero and Pope Paschal II cleansing the area from this malicious legacy. As the story goes, after his suicide Nero was buried in the mausoleum of his paternal family, the Domitii Ahenobarbi, at the foot of the Pincian Hill. The sepulchre was later buried under a landslide and on its ruins grew a huge walnut tree that ″was so tall and sublime that no other plant exceeded it in any ways.″ The tree soon became the haunt for a multitude of vicious demons harassing the inhabitants of the area and also the travelers arriving in the city from the north through Porta Flaminia: ″some were being frightened, possessed, cruelly beaten and injured, others almost strangled, or miserably killed.″ \n\nAs the demons endangered an important access road of the city and also upset the entire population, the newly elected pontiff, Paschal II, was seriously concerned. He ″saw the flock of Christ committed to his watch, becoming prey to the infernal wolves.″ The Pope fasted and prayed for three days and at the end of that period, exhausted, he dreamt of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who gave him detailed instructions on how to free the city from the demonic scourge. \n\nOn the Thursday after the Third Sunday of Lent in 1099, the Pope organised the entire clergy and populace of Rome in one, impressive procession that, with the crucifix at its head, went along the urban stretch of the Via Flaminia until it reached the infested place. There, Paschal II performed the rite of exorcism and then struck the walnut tree with a determined blow to its root, causing the evil spirits to burst forth, madly screaming. When the whole tree was removed, the remains of Nero were discovered among the ruins; the Pope ordered these thrown into the Tiber.\n\nFinally liberated from the demons, that corner of Rome could be devoted to Christian worship. Paschal II, to the sound of hymns, placed the first stone of an altar at the former site of the walnut tree. This was incorporated into a simple chapel which was completed in three days.

I Link Information: The Xbox 360 began production only 69 days before launch, and Microsoft was not able to supply enough systems to meet initial consumer demand in Europe or North America, selling out completely upon release in all regions except in Japan. Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site eBay during the initial week of release, 10% of the total supply. By year's end, Microsoft had shipped 1.5 million units, including 900,000 in North America, 500,000 in Europe, and 100,000 in Japan.\nIn May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10 million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the \"first current generation gaming console\" to surpass the 10 million figure in the US. In the US, the Xbox 360 was the leader in current-generation home console sales until June 2008, when it was surpassed by the Wii. The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870,000 units in Canada as of August 1, 2008. Between January 2011 and October 2013, the Xbox 360 was the best-selling console in the United States for these 32 consecutive months.\nIn Europe, the Xbox 360 has sold seven million units as of November 20, 2008, according to Microsoft. In the United Kingdom, the Xbox 360 has sold 3.9 million units as of June 27, 2009, according to GfK Chart-Track.\nWhile the original Xbox sold poorly in Japan, selling just 450,000 by November 2011, the Xbox 360 sold almost as poorly, selling 1.5 million units from 2005 to 2011. Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan, where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo, had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely. The significance of Japan's poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales.\n\n Question: Which of Microsoft's gaming systems for which the Forza series was developed has sold the most units?",

He first presided over the 62nd ceremony held in 1990 and had last hosted the 65th ceremony held in 1993 Link Information: The nominees for the 62nd Academy Awards were announced on February 14, 1990 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Karl Malden, president of the Academy, and the actress Geena Davis. Driving Miss Daisy received the most nominations with nine total; Born on the Fourth of July came in second with eight. Winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 26, 1990. Driving Miss Daisy became the third film to win Best Picture without a Best Director nomination. At age 80, Jessica Tandy became the oldest winner of competitive acting Oscar at the time. Kenneth Branagh was the fifth person nominated for Best Lead Actor and Best Director for the same film.\n\nAwards.Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double-dagger ().\n\nAcademy Honorary Award.- Akira Kurosawa\n\nJean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.- Howard W. Koch\n\nFilms with multiple nominations and multiple awards.The following 19 films received multiple nominations:\n\nThe following five films received multiple awards:\n\nPresenters and performers.The following individuals presented awards or performed musical numbers.\n\nCeremony information.After the negative reception received from the preceding year's ceremony, AMPAS created an Awards Presentation Review Committee to evaluate and determine why the telecast earned such a negative reaction from the media and the entertainment industry. The committee later determined that Carr's biggest mistake was allowing the questionable opening number to run for 12 minutes. Producer and former Directors Guild of America president Gilbert Cates, who headed the committee, said that Carr would have not received such harsh criticism if the number had been much shorter. Newly elected AMPAS president Karl Malden also commented on the last year's telecast, \"Some of the people in the Academy felt the show got a little out of control.\"\n\nIn September 1989, Cates was chosen as producer of the 1990 telecast. Malden explained the decision to hire him saying, \"Cates, a veteran film and TV director known for his tasteful work in both media will attempt to rectify the damage the last Oscar show did to the Academy's reputation.\" The following January, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen as host of the ceremony. \"We are extremely pleased to have Billy host the show,\" Cates said in a press release justifying his choice. \"His unique talents and his ability to handle the unexpected will be important assets this year.\"\n\nCates christened the show with the theme \"Around the World in 3 1/2 Hours\" commenting that it would \"a party thrown around the world\". He also explained, \"The world is changing, and hopefully the awards show is changing, matching the changes in the world.\" In tandem with the program's theme, several presenters announced the winners from various international locales such as Buenos Aires, London, Moscow, and Sydney, Australia.\n\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Documentary filmmaker Chuck Workman assembled a montage saluting \"100 Years at the Movies\" that was shown at the beginning of the telecast. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director for the ceremony. Dancer and singer Paula Abdul supervised the Best Song nominee performances and a dance number featuring the Best Costume Design nominees. Singer Diana Ross performed the Oscar-winning song Over the Rainbow in a tribute to the 50th anniversary of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nBox office performance of nominees.At the time of the nominations announcement on February 14, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $244 million with an average of $48.9 million. Dead Poets Society was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $95.8 million in the domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Field of Dreams ($64.4 million), Born on the Fourth of July ($48.6 million), Driving Miss Daisy ($35.6 million) and My Left Foot ($2.1 million).\n\nOf the 50 grossing movies of the year, 43 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only Parenthood (8th), Dead Poets Society (9th), When Harry Met Sally... (10th), Field of Dreams (17th), Born on the Fourth of July (25th), Driving Miss Daisy (36th) and Sex, Lies, and Videotape (45th) were nominated for Best Picture, acting, directing, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nomination were Batman (1st), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (2nd), Lethal Weapon 2 (3rd), Back to the Future II (6th), The Little Mermaid (12th), The Abyss (22nd), and Black Rain (27th).\n\nCritical reviews.The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Film critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave an average review of Crystal but lamented, \"The effort to make this year's Academy Awards show an international media miracle led to nothing but headaches.\" The Washington Post television critic Tom Shales bemoaned, \"while Crystal's opening monologue seemed to hit the right notes, he hit fewer and fewer as the evening wore on; his interjected quips between awards were mostly uninspired.\" He also criticized the dance numbers and numerous \"Around the World\" cutaways calling it pointless. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times quipped that the broadcast was \"a conventional telecast that was arguably an extension of an industry calcified by convention.\" He gave positive remarks toward Crystal but felt that \"The Oscarcast was an old kid on the block.\"\n\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. USA Today television critic Matt Roush lauded \"To the glib and savvy Billy Crystal, who kept things as lively and funny as he could all night long. What a chore, too.\" He concluded that, \"Hollywood no doubt went to bed happy (maybe early), because for a change Oscar didn't embarrass himself.\" Mike Drew of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel remarked, \"While too \"inside\" and not as funny as Hollywood thinks he is, Crystal was an efficient host.\" Film critic Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \"It was encouraging that director Gilbert Cates took the opportunity to emphasize films instead of chorus girls.\" She also extolled Crystal's performance acknowledging that his \"nimble opening number set a Johnny Carson comic tone.\"\n\nRatings and reception.The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 40.24 million people over its length, which was a 5% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 69.31 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.82% of households watching over a 49.42 share.

Link Information: He began to exhibit in 1824, when he had in the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists a \"View in Cumberland,\" but he did not send a picture to the Royal Academy until 1832, in which year appeared \"The Druids cutting down the Mistletoe.\" This was followed in 1833 by a picture containing full-length portraits of the daughters of the Hon. Colonel Lowther. His next exhibit was \"Harvest Home in the Fourteenth Century,\" which appeared at the British Institution in 1837, and was presented by the artist to his patron, the Earl of Lonsdale. After this date he painted portraits, views of mansions, &c., but he did not exhibit again until 1847, when he sent to Westminster Hall \"The Highland Ferry-Boat,\" which was engraved in line by James Tibbits Willmore. \"The Proposal\" appeared at the Royal Academy in 1848; \"The Highland Bride,\" likewise engraved by Willmore, in 1851; \"Going to Church: Scene in the Highlands,\" in 1852; \"The Hope Beyond,\" in 1853; \"The Course of true Love never did run smooth,\" in 1854; \"The Mountain Ramblers,\" in 1855; \"Sunny Hours of Childhood\" and \"Looking out for the Homeward Bound,\" in 1856; and \"The Pet Lamb,\" in 1857. He painted in 1858 \"Crossing a Highland Loch,\" which was engraved by Charles Mottram; but he did not again exhibit until 1860, when he sent to the Royal Academy \"The Signal,\" which was engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal of 1862. In 1864 he had at the academy \"The Height of Ambition,\" engraved by Charles Cousen for the Art Journal, as was likewise by J. C. Armytage \"Drawing the Net at Hawes Water,\" painted in 1867 for Lord Esher, but never exhibited. \"Rush Bearing\" and a view of Rydal Mount are among his best works.\n\nIn his later years Thompson devoted himself chiefly to landscape subjects with figures, the themes of which were for the most part drawn from the mountains and lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, but occasionally from Scotland. His range, however, was limited, and his work was lacking in poetic sympathy. His attempts at classical and scriptural subjects, such as \"Acis and Galatea,\" exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849, and \"Proserpine,\" were not a success. His last work was \"Eldmuir, or Solitude.\" Question: What other paintings has Jacob Thompson created?",
