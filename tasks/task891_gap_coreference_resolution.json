He left shortly after to create another perspective, his great view of London in 1647. On the middle sheet is a legend with a signature where Hollar says that the etching was based on drawings, taken in 1636. In 1636 with **his** new patron, Thomas Howard, he returned briefly from German lands to Prague and then went to England.",
