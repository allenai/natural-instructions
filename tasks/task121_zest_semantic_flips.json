    "Definition": "Please change the meaning of the following question by changing as few words as possible. Create different questions that have the same output format (i.e. if the question has a yes/no answer so should yours, etc.). \n\nEmphasis & Caution: 1. All the questions should be written so that your new question will have a different answer than the original would, 2. Leave the original sentence the same as much as possible, changing only the meaning of the question, 3. Try to write specific questions that are not too easy. 4. Make your questions specific and concrete rather than open-ended or subjective, 5. Your questions should change the original question as little as possible.",
