In both movies, neither character was supposed to be singing Both songs were written by African Americans in the late 1950's Both songs were written in the future compared to the time the scenes were set in (the scene from Back to The Future was set in 1955, and as far as I can tell Top Secret was set during WWII) Both songs were clearly unexpected by both the listeners and the band Most of the listeners in both movies gradually liked the song more and more (except until the end in Back to The Future) Both movies had a lot of focus on a red electric guitar at the end of the song Possible similarity: In Back to The Future, Marty tells the band \"this is a blues riff in 'B',\" and in Top Secret, Nick also tells the band something, but I couldn't make out what he said.    My first thought was that since Top Secret is a parody film, that they got the idea from Back to The Future, but according to IMDB, Top Secret was released a year before Back to The Future.

The accepted answer in Why did Lovett invite Rose aboard his search boat in Titanic? suggests Rose threw it overboard for 'closure', but I simply cannot understand how that was closure. After all, it is not as though Jack (when alive) had any real interest in it. Nor did Rose. It was of interest only to her fiance Cal (who took his own life in 1929, when the stock market crashed).  It could be said that the return of the 'Heart of the Ocean' to the ocean, was ..poetic in a sense, but how was it closure? If not closure, then why did she do it?  Update  Interestingly, the original script differs from the movie in that the people searching for the diamond are there to witness her throwing it overboard. She even has a few words with Lovett as he is holding the object of his desire in his hand.     You look for treasure in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is precious, and making each day count.   Another snatch of the script that might be relevant:    The hardest part of being so poor, was being so rich.

BUTCH  I didn't realize there was a   difference between a tummy and a pot   belly.   FABIENNE  The difference is huge.   BUTCH  You want me to have a pot?   FABIENNE  No. Pot bellies make a man look either   oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a   woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The   rest of you is normal. Normal face,   normal legs, normal hips, normal   ass, but with a big, perfectly round   pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a   tee-shirt two sizes too small to   accentuate it.

It's unfortunate what we   find pleasing to the touch and   pleasing to the eye is seldom the   same.   BUTCH  If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in   it.   FABIENNE  You'd punch me in my belly?   BUTCH  Right in the belly.   FABIENNE  I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your   right on your face 'til you couldn't   breathe.   BUTCH  You'd do that to me?   FABIENNE  Yes!

Overall, I appreciated the show, and especially seasons 4-6, a great deal more now than I did during my initial watch. Now I also see that most questions were answered, even though some questions are still left for debate.  One question that I do wish the producers had given a more satisfactory answer to, though, is the connection between Eloise Hawking and MIB's loophole. When Locke leaves the island, he is told by Christian Shephard (i.e. MIB), to find Eloise Hawking in Los Angeles. Eloise is then later paramount in ensuring that the loophole works in that she is insisting that the coffin with Locke's body must be on board the Ajira-flight, thus providing MIB with his \"vessel\" for completing the loophole. These two facts made me think that perhaps Eloise somehow was cooperating with MIB, but this is never really confirmed, and since we know that MIB can not leave the island, this means that MIB must have \"recruited\" Eloise before she left the island. But if this is the case, how could MIB know about his loophole-plan years before it manifested? Does MIB perhaps have contact with somebody else off the island who could relay information to Eloise? Or is it perhaps possible that Eloise really had no contact with MIB, and simply insisted Locke's body had to be on the Ajira-flight in order to have a \"substitue\" for Christian Shephard's body which was on Oceanic 815? Or was she somehow manipulated by MIB without her knowledge through some way never seen on the show?   I really do not find a satisfactory answer to this, so I would love to hear some theories from other people here!",

A few lines and glances by Inspector Robert Highland (played by David Threlfall), riding in the van, seem to indicate that he is on Sean's side, or at least understands the IRA cause with the following lines:    Although I disapprove of the things ye've done, Sean, I can't quite  bring meself to condemn ya. I can't... because I understand where the  hatred comes from. I more than understand it.   When the van comes under siege, the officers don't seem to know what's going on, while Highland just keeps looking at Sean as if they both know exactly what's happening. The two officers then wish to hold out for backup, yet Highland orders them to open the doors. During the discussion afterwards, group leader Kevin O'Donnell seems to believe that Highland is an honest cop, asking him how much the English pay him to turn on his own people (Highland is Irish). O'Donnell then hands a gun to Sean Miller and    Miller promptly executes both Highland and the two officers that were in the van.   I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure about the nuanced context here. The lines may simply be Highland attempting to turn Miller so that he'll testify against the rest of his group, but the glances between them - and the actions of Highland himself - don't really make as much sense in that context. Surely the book would explain such details better than the film.  Was Inspector Highland their man inside (and his fate was only to show how insane Miller is) or was he an honest cop?   And, yes, I realize that a different inside man was revealed at the end of the movie. That doesn't preclude the Inspector being one also, though, or at least an IRA sympathizer/mole. Highland's fate also foreshadows that of     terrorist ally Dennis Cooley, who is also executed by Miller.",

            "input": "This question is about the two-oscar winning movie Great Gastby (2013) that was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann.   Only after I had seen this extraordinary movie and found out that F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work \"The Great Gastby\" has been translated into a film five times did I decide to finally read the novel.  But the novel story turned out to be very different.  Tobey Maguire played Nick Carraway as a guileless heterosexual, but in the novel, his sexuality's a bit ambiguous:    \"Come to lunch someday,\" [Mr. McKee] suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.    \"Where?\"     \"Anywhere.\"     \"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator boy.     \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn't know I was touching it.\"    \"All right,\" I agreed, \"I'll be glad to.\"    . . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.   Why would the great author Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald bother to include this strange passage, silly Nick in bed with the feminine Mr. McKee in his underwear at 3AM? If not to show some signs of Nick's sexual orientation, what other purpose could it possibly serve?   In the book, Nick meets Mr. McKee at a party and goes home with him. In the film, director Luhrmann made him go to the party, and made him ending up cuddling (or most likely) having sex with a woman.   Furthermore, in the movie, Nick is first attracted to Gatsby's parties by a glimpse of a lovely young woman. He seemed visibly affected by the sensuality of Myrtle Wilson. In the book, he recognizes her appeal, but showed revulsion and profound disapproval; later he was sneering at her \"artificial laughter.\"  The film decided to erase the hints of Nick's gayness and I feel violated.   Not forgetting the feeling of excitement and mystery language when Nick met his wealthy neighbor Gatsby for the first time. He fell in love in first sight.    He smiled understandingly — much more than understandingly. It was one  of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that  you might come across four or five times in your life. It faced — or  seemed to face — the whole external world for an instant, and then  concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It  understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in  you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it  had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to  convey.     Nick wandered with vapid wonder in his smile. Nick loves Gatsby. He's obsessed with him: his hopes, his personality, his wealth, his life, his parties, his education, his aspiration, his true love for Daisy. He becomes so entangled in Gatsby's story because he is just too in love to have a life of his own.  Nick wanted us to believe, as he does, that Gatsby is different, that     only… the man who gives his name to his book, was exempt from [his]  reaction   of scorn because of Jay's     extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such that I have  never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall  ever find again.   In other words, he just said “I loved this man.”  I feel cheated, because one important thing is how Nick's sexuality affects what we are reading. If Nick is in love with Gatsby—and this seems pretty clear—then the entire novel operates as a rationalization of that misplaced love (unlike what is pictured in the movie). Probably, Nick romanticized Gatsby in the exact same way that Gatsby romanticized Daisy.   So why did this director Baz Luhrmann hide that? The film, in robbing him of his homosexuality (or bisexuality), also robs him of his reserve, and not coincidentally, of his intelligence. Expecting a more intelligent answer than in 2013, gay content is controversial, and gay characters can be hard for a lot of people to accept.. We're not in the 19th century anymore and there is no gay content anyway, just some signs of the gayness from the book. In the book he wasn't a gay character, there was some signs, why were they masked?",

Then I found this explanation from the book Afro-Latino Voices: Translations of Early Modern Ibero-Atlantic Narratives: lucumi was a term used by transatlantic slave traders to identify slaves that the Yoruba tribe was selling to them and was used as a self-identification term by the descendants of these slaves, that lived in Western South America and called themselves de casta lucumi (\"of the Lucumi caste\").  This one definitely seems related, but if Lucumi is not a family name, but a name of the people (or \"caste\") then why Blackie gave it as a name that his mother gave him and Pena was referring to him using it?  Could someone having knowledge on Colombian/South American culture explain that?  Edit: The information about lucumi being a name of the slaves of Yoruba origin can also be found in Spanish language Wikipedia (provided that the Google translation got it right).

The scream rose to fame in recent decades when Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt used it in his work on Star Wars and other films. And other filmmakers have followed the lead—such as Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, and Peter Jackson—and used it themselves in their films.  If you are unaware of what the Wilhelm Scream sounds like, watch this video compilation which includes clips of it's use in Star Wars films among others:       Since each Star Wars film including the prequels has had at least one occurrence of the “Wilhelm Scream” in them, can anyone recall/remember if the Wilhelm Scream was heard anywhere in The Force Awakens?

So Sara shot an arrow that hit Eric; he fainted and looked like he is dead and then Sara and the snow queen left with the army of the snow queen leaving 2 dwarfs and Eric's body.  The dwarfs pull the arrow from Eric's body with difficulty and they do Eric woke up and the dwarfs are stunned by that. Eric looks to his locket suggesting that the locket took most of the force of the hit.  I have several questions about this particular scene.   How can Eric survive such an attack? You can see Eric dodge backwards by the impact of the arrow in that scene and immediately faint on the ground. Even if Sara hit the locket intentionally to take most of force of the arrow, how can she manage to hit it in a way that the arrow hit the locket without breaking it into two (or several parts) and also it hit Eric's chest? And in such a way that doesn't kill him. (You can say that arrow hit Eric also as it is still intact to body and the dwarfs use quite a strength to remove it from the body and there is also blood on his chest). Did Sara hit some special spot of his body that makes Eric faint and removing it wakes him up? And in the immediate next scene he looks normal with blood on his chest, smiling and planning with the dwarfs about how to enter the castle like nothing has happened.   Sara never misses but how is she able to execute such a hard task?   Is there something that I am missing or am I thinking too much and should just watch and enjoy?",

And \"The Other Side of  Midnight,\" for obvious reasons.   Now, I haven't read either of those books, but I do know what The Art of War is about and so I understand what the \"obvious reasons\" are for it being popular in prison.  I looked up the plot to The Other Side of Midnight on Wikipedia, and it seems to be mostly about a French woman trying to get what she wants (namely a relationship with an American pilot) through seduction and manipulation. The most relevant thing to prison or the justice system seems to be that at the end, the woman and the pilot plead guilty to murder because they think a plea bargain is in place, when in fact there is no bargain.  Later in the episode    someone leaves a copy of The Other Side of Midnight on Naz's bed, with a note that says \"take the deal.\"   How does that make sense, since seemingly    the lesson of TOSoM is to not make a plea deal because you can't trust that there actually is a deal, so why couple the book with the advice to take the deal?   And what are the \"obvious reasons\" that The Other Side of Midnight is popular in prison?",
