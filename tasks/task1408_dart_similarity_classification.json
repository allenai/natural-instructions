        "This task is about classifying the similarity of two sentences. The sentences can be classified as (a) SIMILAR - similar to each other, and (b) DISSIMILAR - not similar to each other. Sentences that have the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] are similar to each other. The input is a list of two sentences and the output is either SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR."
