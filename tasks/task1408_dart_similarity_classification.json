    "Definition": "This task is about classifying the similarity of two sentences. The sentences can be classified as (a) SIMILAR - similar to each other, and (b) DISSIMILAR - not similar to each other. Sentences that have the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] are similar to each other. The input is a list of two sentences and the output is either SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR.",
    "Positive Examples": [

            "input": "['piątek is the word for Friday in Polish', 'You say Friday in Polish by piątek.']",
            "output": "SIMILAR",
            "explanation": "The classified label of this sentence is a good example since both the sentences share the same RDF structure [['Polish', 'FRIDAY_FIFTH_DAY', 'piątek']] and are essentially conveying the same thing."
