        "You have to predict the type of conversation sentence given as input. Your predictions can be one among: 'information' if the input statement states a piece of information, 'question' if the input statement asks for some information, 'directive' if the input sentence involves the management or guidance of operations, and 'commissive' when it constitutes a statement that commits the speaker to some future action."
