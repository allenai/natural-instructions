        "In each example you will read a short sentence (or two). Then, a pronoun in the text is mentioned. Your task is to choose a referent which the mentioned pronoun refers to. You will be given two options in each case and one choice should seem much more likely to you than the other."

            "input": "sentence: i couldn't put the saucepan on the rack because it was too tall .pronoun: it. A) the saucepan B) the rack",
            "output": "the saucepan",

            "input": "sentence: Arnold greatly influenced Jackson , though he lived two centuries earlier .pronoun: he. A) jackson B) arnold",
            "output": "arnold",
            "explanation": "For one person to influence another person, they should leave earlier than them, or contemporary to them. So the pronoun must refer to the influencer, which is Arnold."

            "output": "joe and david's uncles",
            "explanation": "There're two clues for resolving this pronoun. First, one's uncle is not usually 30 years younger than them. Second, younger people are usualy better at sports. The expression \"even though\" shows that there's a certain surprise in the sentence, so the person with better tennis performance should be the older one."
