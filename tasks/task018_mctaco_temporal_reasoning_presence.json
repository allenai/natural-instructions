    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you need to indicate the presence of temporal reasoning in the provided question. Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \"event duration\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\"brushing teeth\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \"being born in the U.S.\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \"being hungry\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" of events, which refers to how often events are repeated (e.g., \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.). Indicate with `Yes` if the question involves temporal reasoning. Indicate with `No`, otherwise."
