    "Definition": "In this study, we want to collect alternate possibilities, i.e., hypotheses that are contrary to the facts. Specifically, we provide a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. You need to change a key aspect of 2nd sentence so that the story continuation changes, but leaves a still interesting short story.  Please make sure that: The new sentence is closely related to the original 2nd sentence, rather than saying a totally irrelevant thing. The new sentence changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences no longer work. Or in other words, the new sentence and the original subsequent sentences can no longer form a consistent story. Note that the new sentence does not have to change the whole subsequent storyline, but just some parts of it. The new sentence should make senses and be consistent with respect to the 1st sentence. \n Things to avoid : Please make the new sentences simple and try to avoid complex sentences. \n Emphasis & Caution: Sometimes you only need to change a few words in the original sentence to make a new one that satisfies the all requirements",
