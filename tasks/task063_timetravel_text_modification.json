    "Definition": "In this study, we want to collect alternate possibilities, i.e., hypotheses that are contrary to the facts. Specifically, we provide a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. You need to change a key aspect of 2nd sentence so that the story continuation changes, but leaves a still interesting short story.  Please make sure that: The new sentence is closely related to the original 2nd sentence, rather than saying a totally irrelevant thing. The new sentence changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences can no longer form a consistent story. \n Things to avoid : Note that the new sentence does not have to change the whole subsequent storyline, but just some parts of it. \n Emphasis & Caution: ",

            "output": "Two dogs rushed into the store.",
            "explanation": "Changed the entity “two men“ to “two dogs“. This is a good edit because it satisfies all the requirements. Note that with the new sentence, the subsequent “The men threatened ...“ in the 4th sentence no longer holds."
