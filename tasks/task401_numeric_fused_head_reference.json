At least give him a quick death . The commander wanted to meet this man who had won the respect of so many . He went to Gahiji ... talked with him in his hut , for many hours . Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces ... along with his entire family . In that man who took Gahiji 's life ... I saw the Devil . So yes , Matthew ...

Why would you do that ? It 's like these pop stars who choose the perfect moment to go into rehab . They call their publicist before they call a taxi . Then they come out and they do their second autobiography - this _ one _ 's called \" Love Me or I 'll Kill Myself \" . Well , kill yourself then . And the papers lap it up . They follow us around and that makes people think we 're important , and that makes us think we 're important .

And , uh , that is a , an area of the world , uh , where human misery and , uh , want , uh , are , uh , very visible , where , uh , Man has reached perhaps the lowest states of degradation , and a young man moving into that scene begins to ask the question , \" Why ? Why all this ? Why - What is this ? Uh , what depths can man fall to , and what is he , anyway ? \" And I began to ask this question , \" What is Man ? \" And , uh , I found oddly enough that nobody could tell me what Man was . Uh , what did he consist of , uh , where was he going , what was he doing ? I became very fascinated with this particular line of research and I made it my life 's work .\nTony Hitchman: Did you read widely of philosophy ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , but the philosopher , of course , has spent most of his working years in his ivory towers , and he was pretty insulated from life . To really know life , you 've got to be part of life . You must get down and look , you must get into the , the nooks and crannies of existence there , you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is .\nTony Hitchman: And you in fact did this ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , I 've slept with bandits in Mongolia and I 've , uh , uh , hunted , uh , with , uh pygmies in the Phillipines ; as a matter of fact , I 've studied _ 21 _ , uh , different primitive races , uh , including the white race ...\nL.

            "input": "Wizard:  Kakarot was born to a low - class Saiyan warrior on the planet Vegeta . He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over 9000 !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was _ 8000 _ . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

Not only does Dragonball heavily abuse cinematic time , but Goku 's final adventures in Dragonball GT are incredibly inconsistent due to his untimely transformation into a child . As ki is dependent on the physical body , his child form likely could not handle his own ki , sending his power into flux .\nBoomstick: And obviously , we 're not using future Goku 'cause that would require a ridiculous amount of assumption . Not to mention we 'd have to use future Superman , who 's pretty much God . So , like Superman , we need to judge Goku in his prime .\nWizard: After experimenting with dozens of different theories , we discovered an iron - clad method to finding Goku 's limits , which we call the Gravity Formula , based around his training in increased gravity . Due to his style of training and Saiyan heritage , Goku increases his abilities proportionate to the amount of force he trains under . While in base form , Goku could lift just under 40 tons . This is equivalent to 586x normal Earth gravity , which we will use in the Gravity Formula along with the Super Saiyan multipliers to calculate Goku 's maximum potential .\nBoomstick: Multiplying the 40 tons by the Super Saiyan forms means he can lift up to 160000 tons in Super Saiyan 4 , strong enough to pick up a continent ... or my ex - wife . Ha ha ! Right after Goku trained on King Kai 's planet , which has gravity 10x stronger than Earth 's , he flew across Snake Way Road as fast as possible to save his friends . It took him 28 hours , impressive since that 's 1000000 kilometers long .\nWizard: Except it 's filled with curves and Goku flew straight over it , so how far did he actually travel ? By comparing Goku 's height to a single spike , we can measure each curve . We can then remove those curves from the overall length . So it turns out that Goku actually flew 307000 kilometers , nearly 11000 km / h .\nBoomstick: To see how fast his base form is at the end of the series , we run the Snake Way number through the gravity formula to find that his top speed clocks in at over 2 1/2 billion km / h , over 2x the speed of light .\nWizard: We can determine Goku 's durability through this bomb , which the brilliant Dr. Gero designed to kill Goku at age 25 , when his maximum potential was Kaio - Ken x4 .\nBoomstick: Scans of the bomb display a TNT measurement of _ 657 _ . Bulma says the bomb could destroy the Earth , so this is likely measured in quadrillion megatons , since it takes at least 53 quadrillion megatons of force to destroy the Earth .\nWizard: So in his final form , Goku can survive up to nearly 35 sextillion megatons .\nBoomstick: Goku does n't rely solely on his physical abilities . He amplifies his strength and durability with ki .\nWizard: But even though his ki reserves can not be measured , we can determine his maximum output . See , his ki attacks do not force him backward unless he allows them to .\nBoomstick: Even when firing upward at full power , the ground beneath him remains untouched .\nWizard: Therefore , according to physics , his maximum output is at most equal to the amount of force he can withstand .\nBoomstick: Luckily , we just calculated that with the Gero bomb .",

But Superman is on a completely different level , _ one _ which really does n't belong in versus matches like these . Sure , due to the writing style of Dragonball , Super Saiyan God Goku 's exact limits are difficult to pinpoint . Also Goku will likely achieve a new form in the future , it 's just how Dragonball works nowadays . However , none of that is really a factor . Goku will always have limits while Superman 's maximum potential is limitless .\nBoomstick - Host: Do n't believe us ? Well strap in boys and girls , let 's look at how Superman breaks reality ! One day Superman was hanging out near Vega , the brightest star in the Lyra constellation .\nWizard - Host: For the record , that 's 25 light years from Earth , or 147 trillion miles .\nBoomstick - Host: Naturally a crisis occurred on Earth , so Superman 's photographer buddy Jimmy activated his signal watch , calling for Superman 's aid . And Superman arrived in a matter of minutes !\nWizard - Host: Being a comic book , the time Superman took getting to Earth is unspecified . However , the comic never mentioned or implied any large time lapse and he arrived as the battle was ending . Even if we seriously lowball this feat to taking ten minutes , Superman would be traveling over 800 trillion miles - per - hour , over a million times the speed of light . But more impressively , Jimmy 's signal watch operates by emitting a high frequency sound only Superman can hear . Which means Superman heard the signal in the vacuum of space 25 light years away . That is physically impossible , except for Superman .\nBoomstick - Host: Hohoho , you want impossible ? How about the time he lifted Spectre off the ground ? A guy literally made up of eternity ! No , not insane enough for you ? Well then how about the time Superman lifted up a book of infinite pages ? That 's right ! Superman lifted both Eternity and Infinity !\nWizard - Host: Though he did have some help from Wonder Woman and Shazam .\nBoomstick - Host: Hey Wiz , what 's half of infinity ? In - fucking - finity !\nWizard - Host: Regardless , they have limits in their own strength , so while they were lifting a specific set part for each load , Superman was lifting everything else , which literally means everything else . Really Wonder Woman and Shazam did n't even need to be there .",

It follows the seasons , beginning each year with the fond expectancy of springtime and ending with the hard facts of autumn . Americans have played baseball for more than 200 years , while they conquered a continent , warred with one another and with enemies abroad , struggled over labor and civil rights and the meaning of freedom . At the games 's heart lie mythic contradictions : a pastoral game , born in crowded cities ; an exhilarating democratic sport that tolerates cheating and has excluded as many as it has included ; a profoundly conservative game that some times manages to be years ahead of its time . It is an American odyssey that links sons and daughters to father and grandfathers . And it reflects a host of age - old American tensions : between workers and owners , scandal and reform , the individual and the collective . It is a haunted game , where each player is measured by the ghosts of those who have gone before .

Once you know his secret , once you know what we have known for the last 2 years , you will not sleep well again . Come , Captain . The greatest nightmare of our time is waiting for you .\nDelenn: There are beings in the universe billions of years older than any of our races . Once , long ago , they walked among the stars like giants . Vast and timeless , they taught all the younger races to explore and create great empires . But , to all things , there is an end . Slowly , the First Ones explored beyond the rim never to return . Some simply disappeared .\nCapt. John Sheridan: Delenn , I 'm sure this is all very fascinating but what does any of this have to do with Morden ?\nDelenn: Not all of the First Ones have gone away . A few stayed behind watching and waiting for the day when they may be needed . When the Shadows come again .\nCapt. John Sheridan: Shadows ?\nDelenn: We have no other name for them . The Shadows were old when even the Ancients were young . They battled each other over and over across a million years . The last great war against the Shadows was 10000 years ago . It was the last time the Ancients walked openly among us . But the Shadows were only defeated , not destroyed . A thousand years ago , the Shadows returned to their places of power , rebuilt them , and began to stretch forth their hand . Before they could strike they were defeated by an alliance of worlds including the Minbari and the few remaining First Ones who have not yet passed beyond the veil . When it was over , the First Ones left . All but _ one _ .\nCapt. John Sheridan: There 's still one of them left ? Where ?\nDelenn: That is why Kosh can not leave his encounter suit . He would be recognized .\nCapt. John Sheridan: Recognized by whom ?\nKosh: Everyone .\nDelenn: For centuries , the Vorlons stood alone . The last remaining guardians . Then , last year , I sent Kosh a message .\nDelenn: Did you see Ambassador Kosh ?\nLennier: I did .\nDelenn: Did you relay my question precisely ? Word for word .\nLennier: I did .\nDelenn: His reaction .\nLennier: Just one word . He said , ' Yes . '\nCapt. John Sheridan: If yes was the answer , what was the question ?\nDelenn: Have the Shadows returned to Z'ha'dum ?",

His Egg Fleet is a huge armada of battleships , led by the massive Egg Carrier , which supports a huge front mounted laser cannon .\nWizard: The Eggman army is spearheaded by his deadliest robot warriors , the Badniks . The EggRobo is a smartbot crafted in Eggman 's own image and designed to carry out tasks Eggman himself would normally do .\nBoomstick: What 's this guy 's deal with eggs ?\nWizard: On its own , Silver Sonic appears slow and bulky but it is powered by a Chaos Emerald , making it a much faster and more practical machine .\nBoomstick: Then he made another robo - hog , Mecha Sonic , who focuses on firepower over speed !\nWizard: Mecha Sonic can even absorb Chaos energy to attain a short lived super form .\nBoomstick: But Eggman wanted more than just Sonic bots . Mecha Knuckles can glide and vomit giant rockets ...\nWizard: And E-101 Beta remains one of Eggman 's most versatile machines .\nBoomstick: He 's a flying robot with super speed , teleportation and a reflector shield ! He shoots homing missiles and kamehamehas and has one of my favorite defensive abilities ever , the backhand !\nWizard: The Shadow Androids are fast and durable and typically fight in groups of _ three _ . However , their design is so complex , they sometimes glitch in close combat . And speaking of glitches , despite being an absolute genius , Dr. Eggman appears to suffer from a peculiar personality disorder that sent him through several different \" phases \" .\nBoomstick: Let 's just hope that Scratch and Grounder phase does n't show up today .\nWizard: But none of Eggman 's creations have ever been as deadly or as successful as his ultimate killing machine ...\nBoomstick: Hyper Metal Sonic !\nWizard: Metal Sonic was specifically designed to be better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every way and was a complete success . Metal can move much faster than Sonic , easily reaching near mach 5 speeds . Metal 's abilities include Sonic 's spindash and homing attack , along with the impenetrable Black Shield .\nBoomstick: He 's also got a chest laser , rocket powered flight and the maximum overdrive attack , where he overloads his circuits to create a glowing energy field that 'll burn through pretty much anything !\nWizard: And that 's not all . Somehow , Eggman managed to make Metal Sonic an ever evolving force . Metal has the uncanny ability to scan and copy data from others , flawlessly replicating their abilities .\nBoomstick: Damn , Eggman sure stepped up his game !\nWizard: Absorbing enough power can transform Metal into a number of more impressive forms , all of which increase his abilities immeasurably .\nBoomstick: The only downside to giving Metal Sonic a super brain is Eggman sometimes has trouble keeping him in line .\nWizard: But even with his metallic minions waging his war , Dr. Eggman is perfectly willing to step into the battlefield himself . He pilots the Eggmobile , a fast single man pod with twin mounted machine guns . The Eggmobile 's most vital function , however , is its universal compatibility to operate almost all of Eggman 's machines .\nBoomstick: Like the humungous Death Egg Robot with its spiked rocket arms and lasers !\nWizard: Eggman is vicious and clever . He 's an expert at playing his opponents right into his hands . At the same time , though , he can be overly obsessive to the point of overlooking some important factors in an effort to concentrate on a single goal . But while this can be a perilous game for Eggman , it also makes him dangerously unpredictable .",

So what I would suggest is , when \" you talk about you 're \" holding politicians ' feet to fire \" , I think that 's disingenuous .\nCo-Host: \" How are you holding up ? \" I mean , come on , you can ask him a real question , do n't you think ?\nJon Stewart: But my point is this .

We 're here to be nice .\nJon Stewart: What I 'm saying is this . I 'm not here to confront you , because we need help from the media and they 're hurting us\nCo-Host: Let me get this straight : If the indictment is that CROSSFIRE reduces everything , as I said in the intro , \" left versus right , black versus white . \" it 's because , see , we 're a debate show .

What is wrong with you ?\nCo-Host: Well , I 'm just saying when you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy 's butt boy , to go ahead and be his butt boy . Come on . It 's embarrassing .\nJon Stewart: I was absolutely his butt boy you would not believe what he ate two weeks ago . The interesting thing I have is , you have a responsibility to the public discourse , and you fail miserably .\nCo-Host: You need to get a job at a journalism school , I think .\nJon Stewart: You need to go to _ one _ . The thing that I want to say is , when you have people on for just knee - jerk , reactionary talk\nCo-Host: Wait . I thought you were going to be funny . Come on . Be funny .\nJon Stewart: No .

            "input": "Herself - Candidate:  Well , let 's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago . We had the worst financial crisis , the Great Recession , the worst since the 1930s . That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy , failed to invest in the middle class , took their eyes off of Wall Street , and created a perfect storm . In fact , Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis . He said , back in 2006 , \" Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money . \" Well , it did collapse .\nHimself - Candidate: That 's called business , by the way .\nHerself - Candidate: Nine million people - nine million people lost their jobs . Five million people lost their homes . And $ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out . Now , we have come back from that abyss . And it has not been easy . So we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy , but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place . Independent experts have looked at what I 've proposed and looked at what Donald 's proposed , and basically they 've said this , that if his tax plan , which would blow up the debt by over $ 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle - class families compared to the wealthy , were to go into effect , we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession . They 've looked at my plans and they 've said , OK , if we can do this , and I intend to get it done , we will have 10 million more new jobs , because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy . Take clean energy . Some country is going to be the clean - energy superpower of the 21st century . Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese . I think it 's real .\nHimself - Candidate: I did not . I did not . I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: I think science is real .\nHimself - Candidate: I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: And I think it 's important that we grip this and deal with it , both at home and abroad . And here 's what we can do . We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels . We can have enough clean energy to power every home . We can build a new modern electric grid . That 's a lot of jobs ; that 's a lot of new economic activity . So I 've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do , and I am determined that we 're going to get the economy really moving again , building on the progress we 've made over the last eight years , but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump ?\nHimself - Candidate: She talks about solar panels . We invested in a solar company , our country . That was a disaster . They lost plenty of money on that _ one _ . Now , look , I 'm a great believer in all forms of energy , but we 're putting a lot of people out of work . Our energy policies are a disaster . Our country is losing so much in terms of energy , in terms of paying off our debt . You ca n't do what you 're looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt . The Obama administration , from the time they 've come in , is over 230 years ' worth of debt , and he 's topped it . He 's doubled it in a course of almost eight years , seven - and - a - half years , to be semi- exact . So I will tell you this . We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs . And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand , because they 're not doing it . And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving , they 're gone . And , Hillary , I 'd just ask you this . You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now ? For 30 years , you 've been doing it , and now you 're just starting to think of solutions .\nHerself - Candidate: Well , actually ...\nHimself - Candidate: I will bring - excuse me . I will bring back jobs . You ca n't bring back jobs .\nHerself - Candidate: Well , actually , I have thought about this quite a bit .\nHimself - Candidate: Yeah , for 30 years .",

They built a shrine around it , and protected the orb by placing it in the mouth of a giant dragon statue , said to be its eternal guardian . You should have seen the detail on this thing . It was INCREDIBLE : scales made of ruby , teeth of pearl ... Speaking of pearl , they say there was this one native girl ...\nBulma: GET ON WITH IT !\nMaster Roshi: Yes , well ... The tribe enjoyed years of prosperity , until one day : evil paid a visit to the village in the form of a band of thieves . These agents of darkness stormed the temple in an attempt to steal the Dragon Ball for their own selfish gain . They were shocked to discover the true power of the Ball . To ensure such an attack never happened again , the Dragon Ball was divided into seven smaller orbs , and scattered across the globe . Separately , the Dragon Balls were useless , but when all _ seven _ were united , then a single voice could summon the Eternal Dragon for one wish , and one wish only . Some wishes were pure , but others were tainted by blind ambition . This led to pain and suffering , as an unjust few wished for power and dominion over mankind . But , as the story goes , there will one day come a hero who will use the Dragon Balls for goodness , and bring peace and unity to the world once more .",

Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what 's going on . Now , look , we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression . And believe me : We 're in a bubble right now . And the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down . We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble . And we better be awfully careful . And we have a Fed that 's doing political things . This Janet Yellen of the Fed . The Fed is doing political - by keeping the interest rates at this level . And believe me : The day Obama goes off , and he leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen , because the Fed is not doing their job . The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump , we 're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay , yet you have not released your tax returns . And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to - who he owes it to and any business conflicts . Do n't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest ?\nHimself - Candidate: I do n't mind releasing - I 'm under a routine audit . And it 'll be released . And - as soon as the audit 's finished , it will be released . But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have . It shows income - in fact , the income - I just looked today - the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million . If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago , I would have been very surprised . But that 's the kind of thinking that our country needs . When we have a country that 's doing so badly , that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world , it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs , because everybody - Lester , we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year . You know what that is ? That means , who 's negotiating these trade deals ? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals .\nHimself - Moderator: The IRS says an audit ...\nHimself - Candidate: Excuse me .\nHimself - Moderator: ... of your taxes - you 're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit . And so the question , does the public 's right to know outweigh your personal ...\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I told you , I will release them as soon as the audit . Look , I 've been under audit almost for 15 years . I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited . I said , do you get audited ? I get audited almost every year . And in a way , I should be complaining . I 'm not even complaining . I do n't mind it . It 's almost become a way of life . I get audited by the IRS . But other people do n't . I will say this . We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of . I will release my tax returns - against my lawyer 's wishes - when she releases her 33000 e - mails that have been deleted . As soon as she releases them , I will release . I will release my tax returns . And that 's against - my lawyers , they say , \" Do n't do it . \" I will tell you this . No - in fact , watching shows , they 're reading the papers . Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete . When the audit 's complete , I 'll do it . But I would go against them if she releases her e - mails .\nHimself - Moderator: So it 's negotiable ?\nHimself - Candidate: It 's not negotiable , no . Let her release the e - mails . Why did she delete 33000 ...\nHimself - Moderator: Well , I 'll let her answer that . But let me just admonish the audience one more time . There was an agreement . We did ask you to be silent , so it would be helpful for us . Secretary Clinton ?\nHerself - Candidate: Well , I think you 've seen another example of bait - and- switch here . For 40 years , everyone running for president has released their tax returns . You can go and see nearly , I think , _ 39 _ , 40 years of our tax returns , but everyone has done it . We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you 're under audit . So you 've got to ask yourself , why wo n't he release his tax returns ? And I think there may be a couple of reasons . First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is . Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be . Third , we do n't know all of his business dealings , but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks . Or maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes , because the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license , and they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax .\nHimself - Candidate: That makes me smart .\nHerself - Candidate: So if he 's paid zero , that means zero for troops , zero for vets , zero for schools or health . And I think probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are , because it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide . And the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate . They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would . And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see . And I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns , because there 's something he 's hiding . And we 'll guess . We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding . But I think the question is , were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ? Who does he owe money to ? Well , he owes you the answers to that , and he should provide them .",

Two lonely people in a big city far from home , they looked to _ one _ another for companionship , and comfort .\nDI Fred Thursday: He got her pregnant .\nDC Endeavour Morse: I spoke to the National Registry first thing . There was a man called Gerald Walters who worked at ICI and he did die in a car crash but there was no whirlwind romance with Pamela Sloan . No marriage . For two years , they kept their affair secret . Pamela passed herself off as a young widow and collected Cartwright 's weekly postal order . Eventually , someone realised Dr. Cartwright was sending money to a woman who was not his wife . They fired a shot into the dark and hit the bull's - eye .

Unfortunately , the murderer also recognised the Reverend Monkford .\nChief Superintendent Bright: You might find this compelling , Thursday , but so far it seems to me nothing but surmise and rank flummery .

So that 's 400 times whatever the mean jerk - time is .\nJared: The what ?\nDinesh: Mean jerk - time . I mean , it does n't matter , but , hypothetically , time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two - dick rate .\nGilfoyle: Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time , and then we can cut that in half .\nDinesh: How would he do four guys ... ? He 's got two hands , so that 's two dicks at a time , right ?\nGilfoyle: Look , you have two guys on either side with their dicks , tip to tip , so you 're going full - length . Four , see ?\nJared: Oh ... From the middle out . That does make sense .\nGilfoyle: Like two Shake Weights .\nDinesh: Yeah , so what we 're trying to do , hypothetically , is minimize which is 800 dudes , multiplied by mean - jerk time , divided by four dicks at a time . Of course , Erlich would have to pre - sort guys by height , so that their dicks lined up .\nGilfoyle: Not by height , technically . The measurement that we 're looking for , really , is dick to floor . Call that D2F.\nErlich: You know , if a guy 's dick was long enough , it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F. The longer the dick , the greater the D2F bridge , but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion ... I 'd just have to jerk it on an angle .\nGilfoyle: So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2 , and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4 , where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle . Call that theta D. Now , the orgasm threshold ... as a function of Lamda sub ...\nJared: Guys , does girth - similarity affect Erlich 's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously ?\nErlich: Shit . Yeah , I think it would .\nErlich: Of course , it does . Time to orgasm , or T2O , has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I 'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that 's already busted .\nGilfoyle: Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out . So on a downstroke , you get a new one in . So when you stroke up you 're not wasting any energy .\nDinesh: Even so .

It would be hard to top this group , quite frankly . In terms of absurdity and their world matching up to the _ one _ that you and I live in , it was interesting . President Bush was saying , \" John Kerry 's rhetoric does n't match his record . \" But I 've heard President Bush describe his record . His record does n't match his record .

In just 48 hours , it 's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook , with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network . As we said a moment ago , we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media , and our first stays on this topic . Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook , \" Trump says the campaign has changed him . When did that happen ? \" So , Mr. Trump , let me add to that . When you walked off that bus at age 59 , were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently ? And you have two minutes for this .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: It was locker room talk , as I told you . That was locker room talk . I 'm not proud of it . I am a person who has great respect for people , for my family , for the people of this country . And certainly , I 'm not proud of it . But that was something that happened . If you look at Bill Clinton , far worse . Mine are words , and his was action . His was what he 's done to women . There 's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that 's been so abusive to women . So you can say any way you want to say it , but Bill Clinton was abusive to women . Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously . Four of them here tonight . One of the women , who is a wonderful woman , at 12 years old , was raped at 12 . Her client she represented got him off , and she 's seen laughing on two separate occasions , laughing at the girl who was raped . Kathy Shelton , that young woman is here with us tonight . So do n't tell me about words . I am absolutely - I apologize for those words . But it is things that people say . But what President Clinton did , he was impeached , he lost his license to practice law . He had to pay an $ 850000 fine to one of the women . Paula Jones , who 's also here tonight . And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago , I think it 's disgraceful , and I think she should be ashamed of herself , if you want to know the truth .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Can\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: we please hold the applause ? Secretary Clinton , you have two minutes .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: Well , first , let me start by saying that so much of what he 's just said is not right , but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses . He gets to decide what he wants to talk about . Instead of answering people 's questions , talking about our agenda , laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country , that 's his choice . When I hear something like that , I am reminded of what my friend , Michelle Obama , advised us all : When they go low , you go high .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: And\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: , look , if this were just about one video , maybe what he 's saying tonight would be understandable , but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women . But he never apologizes for anything to anyone . He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan , the Gold Star family whose son , Captain Khan , died in the line of duty in Iraq . And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion . He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana , but Donald said he could n't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were , quote , \" Mexican . \" He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching . And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America . He owes the president an apology , he owes our country an apology , and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Well , you owe the president an apology , because as you know very well , your campaign , Sidney Blumenthal - he 's another real winner that you have - and he 's the one that got this started , along with your campaign manager , and they were on television just two weeks ago , she was , saying exactly that . So you really owe him an apology . You 're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign , sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb . That was long before I was ever involved , so you actually owe an apology . Number two , Michelle Obama . I 've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you . And I 've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I 've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you , Hillary . So , you talk about friend ? Go back and take a look at those commercials , a race where you lost fair and square , unlike the Bernie Sanders race , where you won , but not fair and square , in my opinion . And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind , because Bernie Sanders , between super - delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz , he never had a chance . And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil . But when you talk about apology , I think the _ one _ that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 e - mails that you deleted , and that you acid washed , and then the two boxes of e - mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing . And I 'll tell you what . I did n't think I 'd say this , but I 'm going to say it , and I hate to say it . But if I win , I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation , because there has never been so many lies , so much deception . There has never been anything like it , and we 're going to have a special prosecutor . When I speak , I go out and speak , the people of this country are furious . In my opinion , the people that have been long - term workers at the FBI are furious . There has never been anything like this , where e - mails - and you get a subpoena , you get a subpoena , and after getting the subpoena , you delete 33000 e - mails , and then you acid wash them or bleach them , as you would say , very expensive process . So we 're going to get a special prosecutor , and we 're going to look into it , because you know what ? People have been - their lives have been destroyed for doing one - fifth of what you 've done . And it 's a disgrace . And honestly , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Secretary Clinton , I want to follow up on that . I 'm going to let you talk about e - mails .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false , but I 'm not surprised .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Oh , really ?\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: In the first debate ...\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: And\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: really , the audience needs to calm down here .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: I told people that it would be impossible to be fact - checking Donald all the time . I 'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we 're going to really make lives better for people . So , once again , go to HillaryClinton.com . We have literally Trump - you can fact check him in real time . Last time at the first debate , we had millions of people fact checking , so I expect we 'll have millions more fact checking , because , you know , it is - it 's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Because you 'd be in jail .",

He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over _ 9000 _ !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was 8000 . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

We believe that Human Beings should be treated with respect ...\nRichard Dawkins: Yes .\nWendy Wright: -and dignity . And the reason we believe that ...\nRichard Dawkins: Well , so do I , of course .\nWendy Wright: The reason we believe that is because we can see that God created each _ one _ of us . And what we find is that philosophies that are built on Evolution oftentimes lead to horrendic- horrific abuses against Human Beings . And you can see why , because it 's drawn on a foundation that says Human Beings are just material , and they should be judged according to their utilitarian use , what thing can they provide for society . We do n't believe that . We believe that each Human Being , whether they can supply something to society or not , if they are disabled , if they are young , that they should be treated with the same amount of respect as you and I should be treated .\nRichard Dawkins: Yes , I mean , I accept all that and I agree with that . I mean , I also think that Humans should be treated with respect . But what we have here is an agenda , it 's that you want Humans to be treated with respect and therefore if the scientific facts go against what your perception is then you 're going to distort the scientific facts . Now , why do n't you instead accept the scientific facts and say \" we still want to treat Humans with respect , so let 's look at evolution and let 's see that we can indeed treat humans with respect within the evolution framework \"\nWendy Wright: What I go back to is the evolutionists are still lacking the science to back it up , but instead what happens is science that does n't bolster the case for Evolution gets censored out . Such as : there is no evidence of evolution going from one species to another species . If evolution had occurred then surely whether its going from birds to mammals or even beyond that , surely there 'd be at least one evidence .\nRichard Dawkins: There is a massive amount of evidence . I 'm sorry but you people keep repeating that like a kind of mantra . Because you just listen to each other . I mean , if only you would just open your eyes and look at the evidence .\nWendy Wright: Show it to me ! Show me the bones . Show me the carcass . Show me the evidence of the in between stage from one species to another .\nRichard Dawkins: Every time a fossil is found that is between one species and another , you guys say : \" Ah , now we 've got two gaps where previously there was only one ! \" Almost every fossil you find is intermediate between something and something else .\nWendy Wright: If that were the case the Smithsonian Natural History Museum would be filled with these examples but instead they 're not .\nRichard Dawkins: Well , it is .
