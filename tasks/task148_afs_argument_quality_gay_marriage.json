    "Definition": "We would like you to assess the QUALITY of each of the following argument (discussing Gay Marriage) and determine if the argument is Valid or Invalid. A valid argument is clearly interpretable and either expresses an argument, or a premise or a conclusion that can be used in an argument for the topic of gay marriage. An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of gay marriage.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
