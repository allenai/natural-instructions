I immediately hang up as I don’t want to get into more drama.\n\nShe (Brenna) then messages me hahahahha and says everyone hates me.

I say that she is an asshole and shouldn’t have done that. She then says I am playing the victim, and that I got payback. She then says it’s hard to pity me, but later says she apoligized even though she didn’t.  She then gets her friends to say that’s uncool of me, and to stop playing the victim. They then say “sorry” but then say they aren’t sorry and that I should’ve lied. I explain that it was Danielle’s question and I answered truthfully.

The symptoms became much worse when I left home and went off to college, decreased significantly when I moved home, and have now started up again. I’ve had what I would consider a panic attack/episode at least 3 times in the past week.

My (technically my family’s) puppy at my parents’ house was always able to distract and comfort me when I was particularly anxious. I believe that I would legitimately qualify for an emotional support animal.\n\nHowever, my issue is that doctors (any health professionals really) are major triggers for my anxiety. Because of this, I would like to obtain a letter via an online service or some sort of teletherapy (the most legit I can find). Note that this would NOT be a registration/certification. I know these are scams. There seem to be services out there that can legally do this, but I know that online services like this are often scams that make life more difficult for people with service animals and even “real” ESAs, which I don’t want to support.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for using a legal but ethically questionable online service for obtaining an ESA letter?

            "input": "I've known this guy for 3 years so far and he has a habit of seeking attention by initiating conversations with uncomfortable topics. Let's call him A.\n\nHe reminded me of myself in 8th grade. I was an edgy idiot who lived for every opportunity to play devil's advocate and frequently shitposted on 4chan's /b/ board. I think he was a /pol/ denizen (as he calls himself and middle eastern people sandniggers). He tells me he's not racist on the basis that he hates everyone and thinks some groups are worse than others in certain aspects. His definition of racism is that there must be a belief of superiority. My definition is that there must be a belief of hierarchy, I just believe that his version is just a negative hierarchy. I.e. everyone starts at zero and certain groups just go further below zero. E.g. \"niggers\" are different from and below \"black people\". All \"niggers\" are black but not all black people are niggers. Yes he said this. \n\nI wanted to help him dig himself out of what I perceived to be a hole.\n\nTwo years ago, I defended him when he wanted to discuss the etymology of the word \"niggardly\" with a black student in a designated African-American themed house on campus, by giving him the benefit of excusing this attention seeking behavior with probable autism. Although I don't blame the student for reporting this, I think it was knee jerk. However,  he was within his full right because A was a guest in his room. I believe this was their first real and direct interaction as A and I totally go to the room to hang out with his roommate Max or Christian. My backing didn't help much as he was removed from the house and was issued a no-contact directive.\n\n However, his next living arrangement was with a Jewish student that straight up lied to get him out of the room. I explained the situation when he asked why A was moving into the room. He was welcoming at first and offered me a beer once I complimented his choice of beer/talked about stouts, but rescinded the offer in a snarky way once he learned I was not 21. I think it was a dick move, but I dont hold it to him as I wouldn't want to jeopardize graduation in year 3 uni either. He claimed that one of our (A and I) friends was smoking in the room.(against university housing rules, but I believe her when she says she didn't) He claimed that the room was a mess. (We were moving his stuff in so things were on the floor and in boxes) The last accusation was that A made a racially charged statement. (Saying \"Oh you're a Jew?\" when it was made apparent) For me that's a grey area because it totally sounds like something A would say, but intonation is key and determines whether or not it is derogatory. I chose to back my friend up regardless because of the other lies that this person made. Apparently he also filed a police report that couldn't be found when A and I looked for the records. \n\nThe end result was that A was moved to a single room and then given a higher bill because it's a single room. I helped him fight that too because he didn't sign up for it. \n\nLater that same year, he shows up to a BLM protest (that I was helping out with) with the intention of asking questions because he was \"invited\"(in my opinion he wasn't). He was just left on the African-American house's email list so he was sent an email inviting him to the protest that also had tons of information. When he showed up, he is recognized by the student as well as a TA (she was a little nutty but fell into his conversational traps in class e.g. got mad to the point of unprofessionalalism) and called a racist. They try to kick him out, non-violently of course, via collective body pushing. At this moment, he throws our mutual friend under the bus and says that she is associated with him which leads to her being kicked out too. \n\nMy roommate asks me to get him out, but I'm too late. On the way home I'm extremely mad and agitated while I explain to him that this wasnt the right thing to do. He defends his actions with the email invitation. Our friend is emotionally distraught and ends up punching him in the face that night. We both believe he showed up to get punched by a protestor, spencer style. Technically he got what he wanted. However, he didn't report her to the police no matter how many times she told him to. After this, he filed a police report against his TA but I don't think anything came of it. Don't quote me on that. \n\nI live with him now, but he doesn't believe he's autistic. I think he toned down the frequency of his trouble some conversation habits and 4chan browsing. He has a girlfriend without a green card so he stopped taking about immigration/makes fun of people getting deported less. He also toned down on self-deprecating racist jokes about the middle east as his girlfriend is vocally bothered by them. They're both middle-eastern. However, he still occasionally comes to me with things that he thinks I'll get heated about. Our mutual friend steve acknowledges that A does this to him too.\n\nE.g. asking me \"do you think that milk is racist?\" while fully knowing that a group of racists on /pol/ tried to make the act of aggressively drinking milk on front of black people a racist gesture. My answer if you care is along the lines of, \"if you do it to be racist, its racist\".",

We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. There’s a train that goes into town but most days fiancé’s parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so they’ll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \n\nAll has been generally fine, my fiancé’s parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30’s especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fiancé’s parents back and forth from the vacation home, I’ve suggested to my fiancé that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\n\nThe other day as my fiancé and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fiancé that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didn’t like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know we’re ok staying on the train. But despite my fiancé’s efforts to tell them that we’re fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fiancé at one point) so my fiancé gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fiancé tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\n\nThen the next day, my fiancé had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousin’s place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fiancé messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousin’s to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousin’s as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \n\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fiancé’s parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fiancé’s time when we’re on vacation? I understand that some parents will always see their kids as children no matter how old they are, but I felt especially annoyed when I was forced to cut short my time with my cousin who I only see once a year because it was apparently “bedtime.” On the other hand, I am so thankful to have in-laws who accept me as one of their own, as I’ve had ex-girlfriends whose parents didn’t like me for whatever reason and I’m thankful to be not dealing with trying to win approval. \n\nTL;DR: On holiday in my fiancé’s hometown. Fiancé’s parents are overly accommodating and can come off as controlling. On the other hand, fiancé’s parents are genuinely the nicest most generous people you’ll ever meet so I feel bad for coming off as being ungrateful for their hospitality. \n\n",

Danielle and I did a lot together growing up, and up until like 6 months ago we were inseparable. However 6 months ago she hooked up with a boy we'll call David (17M), and the time we spend together has decreased considerably. I’m fine with this, and I couldn't be happier for her finding someone who really cares about her in a way I can't.\n\nHowever, what I'm slightly irritated by is him tagging along to almost everything Danielle and I do. It seems like anything I try to do with her he's always there, and I can't have any alone time with my best friend anymore. I ask her to meet up in a study room at the library to work on Math and English while we chat, and she responds with “David and I will be there in a minute,” or I invite her to the movies to see the new release of things we wanted to watch before David was even in the picture, and when she arrives in the theater David is holding the popcorn for them to share. I told Danielle about this and asked as calmly as possible “Do you think David has to be at everything we do?” To which she responded by telling me she thinks I'm just jealous.\n\nHere’s where the story really comes to a head. Danielle's birthday is on Sunday, and I was proud of the gift I planned for her (a new pair of earrings to replace one's she lost at my house some time ago), and we've had plans for her 17th birthday since about a month after her 16th. Well David tells me this morning point blank that he's doing something special with Danielle on Sunday and that I'm not welcome to be in attendance. I ask if I can drop off my gift to her and leave then. He says just give him the gift and he'll give it to her Sunday from me. Me being the unsuspecting sucker that I am agreed.\n\nAfter school today however, I see who else but David and Danielle in line for the bus. David says something along the lines of he has an early gift for her to hold her over till Sunday, and lo and behold, it's the earring box I handed off to him. I had to sit there in complete disbelief at the fact that he just did that. (On the bright side though, she loved the gift) About an hour ago I texted her telling her about this, and she has refused to believe a word of it. She thinks I'm a liar when I tell her the earrings were from me, and she thinks I'm just being jealous still, but no she also called me an asshole for accusing David of stealing.\n\nI'm so fed up with David and everything surrounding him, but I feel like I may lose my best friend over it at this point. I want to know if anything I'm doing is too far so I can stop things before I lose my bestie.\n\n\nWell reddit, work your magic, AITA?\n",

He calls and tells me to come and get the luggage. \"No, I'm sitting down.\" He then says, \"I should've left you the first time, you will never change.\" We had reconciled a month earlier and everything was good and in his words, could tell I was really trying to make it work.

I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as \"life-giving and sacred,\" then ended it with how bras are \"designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'\" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. \nIt doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month. Am I as inconsiderate as they say I am, or am I just a bad friend? \n",

She will be THRILLED, knowing her. I told my parents when I booked the ticket, and they asked if they could come along too, and we could all spend our 30th together - great! I love my family, I don’t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we’d all get to be together. \n\nI did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.\n\nIt’s getting closer to the date, so my sister’s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she’s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn’t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.\n\nMy mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she “has some concerns” about doing that, since sister’s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he’s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. \n\nI sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out. Firstly because my big gift was flying in as a surprise, and it feels less special if everyone is doing it, and secondly because it now feels like it’s her special surprise birthday weekend and everyone is making a big deal about surprising her for it ...but it’s also my birthday too! \n\nAlso (my parents don’t know this), my sister’s boyfriend asked me a long time ago, when I first started arranging my travel plans and it was meant to be just me there, if I minded him proposing to my sister that weekend. He’s wonderful, and I couldn’t be happier for them, so I said yes, of course! But now it feels like everything else is going to overshadow my weekend with my sister. Also, I’m now a little worried that she’ll think her boyfriend arranged for everyone to be there for the proposal and not that it was my surprise that I arranged for her.\n\nAm I being too difficult and controlling about this trip? I’m worried they’re going to think I’m being precious about being the center of attention...and maybe I am?",

That said, with any sexual partner I have had I make sure to remind them that they need to be sanitary before any kind of contact. This means recently showered, hands washed, and if they want to go down on me they need to use mouthwash first (my gyno said that mouth germs can cause things to get funky). \n\nI made my current fwb aware these things being important to me when we engage. As much as I love the heat of the moment, several times I have had to stop him before things got more heated to tell him to go wash his hands. It is kind of annoying and makes me wonder if his past partners did not care as much about their well-being. He has told me before that he washed them *recently*. But I would see him touching his phone, game controller, or whatever germ harboring thing. I explain to him that he needs to wash them right before. The next few times I remind him until I trust he will respect my wishes. \n\nWell, a few days ago things got hot between us. It was very much in the moment, so when he was reaching his hands down my pants I did not say anything and enjoyed. He continued with his mouth, which I blindly assumed was clean. We finish up and all is fine. Within the next few times I go to the bathroom I notice that things start to smell fishy down there. I had not seen him go right before we did that, but was not paying attention either. I have never had issue with these kinds of things without impulsive sexual decisions (not STD’s, more like doing things while camping or in other less sanitary situations where immediate hand-washing and that sort of thing did not happen). A friend once told me that vagina’s clean themselves when I told her how much of a stickler I am in bed. I know this is true, but only to a certain extent. \n\nSo now I am left super irritated that he did not mind my wishes and I have to feel like an AH every time I need to remind him to wash up. ",

Whenever I smell smoke wafting up into my suite I simply close my patio door or bedroom window and it prevents stinking up my suite.\n\nThe incident \nI was assembling IKEA furniture at 5PM. I hear a ton of banging on the floor. I adjust to work more quietly and finish entirely within 20 minutes. \n\nThe fallout \nThe next day I come home to a mild smell of cigarette smoke in the entrance to my apartment. I see an envelope on the floor under my doors mail slot, and when I pick it up it reeks of cigarette smoke. I open it and read a strongly word letter from the tenant downstairs, complaining of loud banging at 5PM the day before, threatening to contact the tenancy board and pursue further action of this nature. I put the letter in a zip lock to contain the smell. My apartment smells nice and my air freshener doesn’t need competition. \n\nMy take \nThis dude is over sensitive to noise, irritable in general and gross. I wait on it a few days and think on how to respond.\n\nI decided:\n- I really don’t want to interact with this person. It will be very very unpleasant between the predictable stink and the likelihood of a unpleasant exchange. \n- instead, after a week, I wrote a note to the landlord saying I normally ignore the eccentric irritability of the person downstairs but now that they are leaving stinky letters in my entrance I have to address it. \n- I included the stinky letter in the ziplock bag for the landlord to read and presumably smell.\n- I told the landlord I will be ignoring this tenant going forward as best I can. I also mentioned that my neighbour to my right has never complained of noise and even told me he likes living next to me because I’m not loud or obnoxious and as a bonus I’m not a smoker.\n- my call to action with the landlord was that he simply ask the tenant downstairs to be more tolerant of noise during daytime hours and to cease putting anything in my mail slot.\n\nJudge me \n\nAm I the asshole for:\n- avoiding the tenant downstairs entirely and just tattling to the landlord\n- avoiding conflict not because I’m afraid but because I just genuinely think the tenant downstairs is stinky and passive aggressive and his letter gave me all the insight I needed on both.

We became very good friends last year because I had some trouble getting into the groove of studying and he helped me out a lot. Over time I befriended some of his classmates.\n\nSo last semester Nat failed his first exam here. I've failed before and its devastating, but you get two chances to rewrite and that helps you in the long run in my opinion, because the learning material is a but fresher in your mind. I didn't find out til the weekend before he was supposed to write, but when I did I played him a visit. He seemed really down and was seriously doubting his ability to pass and stay in the school. I spent several hours consoling him before I had to leave. \n\nThat same weekend my class left for a four week community posting in a rural area with awful connection, I had to walk several kilometers to make my calls. I tried to call him everytime I went which was at least twice a week. He wouldn't know the results til we came back and was seriously stressing over it.

I’m playing a charismatic fighter who’s goal is to reform his old vigilante/mercenary group (basically the Minutemen from fallout 4) this requires me to go about recruiting willing people to join my cause, be they mercenaries,beggars, etc etc. This campaign has been planned for about 6 months and I remember deciding in passive aggressive anger over something I’ve forgotten that instead of working up to making the “not” Minutemen I would start with the company already formed with about 120 troops. The dm offered no push back at all on this. \n\nThe session started and we were being hired by the king to go find the queen who had been taken by the generic baddies. He was also sending his son to accompany us and to serve as our blank cheek (meaning we wouldn’t have to pay for anything at all during our campaign) I informed the king that he would have to also pay for my mercenary company’s maintenance costs. Seeing as I had point tons of points into charisma I expected me to be told to make a charisma roll. No such luck. Instead I ended up in an hour long in character discussion with the king about paying for my company. No roles, just arguing. Eventually the king agreed to pay for my company seeing as I planned to use them during the adventure. With that concluded, we set off to the market and tavern to both give orders to my company and also purchase anything we needed before setting off. It was at this point that I asked the prince to buy me plate armor from the local store, which the warforged shop owner cheerful gave to me for free. At Lvl 1. We then proceeded to the tavern to give orders to the company to set up camp elsewhere in the kingdom and wait for further instructions as well as breaking off 10 men to accompany us to the next town for auxiliary work (not participate in combat) as well as to give another player who couldn’t make it to the session a reason to be with the party since he was one of my mercenaries. We set off to the next town, when on the way there we discovered some traps on the road, the dm then said that we disarmed them, no roll, or even who disarmed them, just that we disarmed them with no input from any players. We were then ambushed by ravens and a tree person (I think a dryad). After that was sorted we went to the next town and ended the session there. \n\nOver the next few days the topic of my character came up in the group chat and we were told we would be voting as a party what would happen to my character, explicitly being told that of our group consisting of seven, six would have to agree to banning my character. after a lengthy discussion where I was told that I was ruining the game due to my mercenary company being disruptive to the game flow, me and two other party members argued that the only time they came up in a way that effected the party was in the hour long discussion that was only due to me not being told to roll charisma.  The dm then proceeded to tell me that I had to make a new character because my current one was so disruptive to the game. Every time me and the other two party members pointed out why it was bullshit (the two party members backstories relied on my character existing, me having less effect on the game then other players) we were told by another player that what the dm says is final and we should stop arguing. It was at this point that me and the other two considered leaving since i was being told to drop a character I had invested a bit of work into and that we essentially had no say in what happened despite being told we would. After some more discussion I said that I was perfectly happy to go to my original idea of trying to reform the company instead of already starting with it (as was my original intent) this was followed by another hour of arguing about how I couldn’t recruit people to join us because the dm didn’t want to deal with an entire new party, thus defeating the purpose of my character. We did eventually come to the conclusion to restart the game and allow me to recruit characters to assist our party. \n\nRight now however I’m not sure if my actions were appropriate, the two other party members seem to this so but I’m not sure myself. I acknowledge that starting with the mercenary company was a bad idea done in spite which is why I was so willing to reverse it, but I don’t know about the dm’s response of flat out banning my charismatic fighter. I’m curious to hear others thoughts on this.",

            "input": "So I befriended someone online last year (we'll call him A) and learned that he was in a really shit situation financially and emotionally. He used to live in the south and his family and the people in his small town weren't very respectful or accepting of his gender identity/sexuality/general existence. I wasn't in a much better place financially, but after much begging and pleading on my part (he didn't want to move across the US to live in the Pacific Northwest initially because he'd never lived so far from home, which is understandable) he finally let me buy him a plane ticket to get to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe moved in with me in July of 2018, and I already had a job waiting for him when he got up here. Through no fault of his own, he was laid off a week later (the job had been for a temp agency in a volatile position that depended entirely upon the work load the company had, and the temp agency had hired too many people for what the job required). A couple of weeks later, he found another job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, we were living in a shitty little 1 bedroom apartment with a third roommate (J), who had approved of and helped with the decision to move A in with us, but J had made it clear he was moving out at the end of the lease. Come October, I'd been laid off from my job for the same reason as A (we'd been working in different departments at the same company), but found another job within a day of being laid off. He was working too, but was getting less and less hours. He eventually decided to quit...a week or so after we moved into our new apartment (this is important, as it sets a precedent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely managed to convince him to wait until he had another job lined up, because I would have had to pay all of our bills (which doesn't amount to as much as some people's I know) on not enough income. But it didn't matter anyway, because he ended up getting laid off from there too. Fast forward two and a half months, and he's finally gotten another job (after I've had to pull some shady shit to get our bills paid for which I already know I'm the asshole). I had to beg and plead with him to actually put in applications in the first place and I dragged him to the Subway he got a job at to put in his application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Subway doesn't do 'full time' (40 hours a week minimum) for anyone who isn't management. Their 'full time' is no more than 30 hours a week, as it is dependent upon the company's policy what their definition of full time is. Minimum wage here isn't enough to survive on, as in most places, especially not if you're only making part time. I was ecstatic for him when he got a job, because the stress of having to pay all the bills and buy our groceries was killing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got an email from the recruiter of the temp agency I work for now that my site is hiring for 3 more positions in my department. I don't make amazing money here, but it's more than minimum wage and is guaranteed 40 hours a week. Not to mention that the only skill you need to have is the basic understanding of how to use a computer and talk on a headset, and it's temp to hire (hired on permanently after 90 days). I'd talked to A about this in the past about possibly getting a position here and he agreed that he would be interested. I told him about the position and he immediately said that he wouldn't do it because he'd just gotten hired on with Subway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had three separate conversations (read: arguments) with him about this, trying to get him to understand why I'm so anxious and upset about him taking this part time food service job over a full time temp to hire position that is so much more secure and has consistent hours. And he comes back at me saying that I need to stop bothering him about it and that it's starting to piss him off that I'm not respecting his decision. I'm frustrated beyond belief, and I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to make rent if he's not getting consistent hours. It's putting strain on our friendship, and I'm too much of a pushover (not a humblebrag, i'm the fucking worst about this) that I'll never be able to kick him out, especially since he literally has nowhere to go. He couldn't even get back home to the south if he wanted to because we have $0 in savings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLogically, I think I know I'm not the asshole in this situation, but I am constantly doubting myself about everything I say and do because I'm not a terribly confident person, and I'm anxious about everything and anything I do. Especially when it comes to roommates, as I've had pretty much this exact situation happen in the past. You'd think I'd learn, but that's where that pushover bit comes to bite me in the ass. Anyway, this is my first post on Reddit and I'm sorry for writing a novel for you all. Let me know what you guys think...?",

            "input": "BACKSTORY:\nThis issue is between my housemate and I; let’s call her Mary. We’ve lived together for a bit over a year and when I first moved in we became best friends immediately. However with that closeness came disparity and we’ve had a few arguments since then. I’ve never had this kind of dynamic with any friend or housemate before, and the first time we fought was a shock to me. \n\nThis particular incident has some backstory that informs my feelings and reaction. A few months ago we had a fight after Mary accidentally got the impression that I showered twice a day every day. She told me that I shouldn't; I said that I didn't except in special cases, but \"also hygiene is a really personal thing and on really sweaty summer days I might shower twice, and I don’t think that’s unusual or a bad habit.\" She didn't take this well, citing how much water one shower uses and \"to be asked not to take 2 showers a day in a share house is a reasonable request. What’s not reasonable is how self-righteous you are about it and how you’re trying to infer that your hygiene is being policed. Please don’t manipulate the conversation this way ever again, I don’t take lightly to manipulation whether it’s conscious or not.\" These were literally her words in the message she sent me.\n\nI was actually really hurt by her reply. I’ve tried to take the criticism in stride and work on being less defensive and more clear in my communication. As a result of this conversation I have been extra careful to never shower twice a day unless I have a good reason.\n\nNOW: \nI work night shifts and on this night got home around 10.30pm. While at work I had started to feel itchy and even after leaving the office it didn’t go away. While Mary and our other housemate John watched a movie, I laid in bed feeling itchy, depressed (for other reasons), and apathetic. After the movie John took a shower which gave me the idea to do so myself, as it might help my itchiness. \n\nMary often has to be up early (earlier than the rest of us) and has asked us not to make noise once she goes to bed on school nights (including not flushing the toilet or taking showers, as our pipes rattle hard). I respect this and do my best not to make noise on those nights. At this point however Mary was still pottering around in the kitchen. At 11.40 as I got into the shower I heard Q grumbling about us showering close to midnight. I was in and out of the shower within five minutes and went straight to be afterwards.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to these messages:\n\n&gt;HER: Hey showerinpeacepls quick question, why?\n&gt;You got home an hour ago and tomorrow is your day off: why now?\n\nThese messages made me really uncomfortable. I feel like a child being asked to explain myself to my mother, except that I’m 30. I want to tell her what I’m feeling but I'm not confident I can face her without being sure: am I the asshole?",

She lives a good bit aways from me but she had planned to cook and just make a day of it. I wake up that day feeling out of it but since we made plans and she had already started to prepare the food I decided to go instead of canceling. I get there and we hang out a little while. Her neighbor calls and decides to come over. I usually don't mind her neighbor but she can be very loud and touchy. I wasn't in the mood to deal with her personality that day. After a little while I decide to leave. I didn't make a scene or say anything I just said I was going to go and that was it. It really upset my friend but I think it handled it appropriately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have talked about it some since and she insists that I was in the wrong. I fully believe that I was the problem in this situation and that is why I left. She has said if I didn't want her neighbor to come over I could have said something to start with but it doesn't feel right for me to say I don't want her friend to come over while I am at her house. She has said if it was bothering me she would have sent her neighbor home but again it doesn't feel right for me to have her picking between me and another one of her friends. Me leaving has also upset her neighbor because she felt as if she was intruding. I didn't intend for that outcome. They seemed to be having a good time laughing and joking and since I wasn't I thought it best that I left. I was a little annoyed in the moment but I wasn't upset or angry or anything I just wasn't having a good time. It also ruined the big dinner she had planned which I know was looking forward to all week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stress enough that I don't think my friend or her neighbor did anything wrong in this situation. I was the problem and that is why I handled it the way I did. I still think I wasn't wrong to leave but she disagrees.

After 18 months, they delivered carpet, but people drove on my back yard, without permission ripping up grass. \n\n\n Friend bought a new store and everything inside including a lot of carpet. I bought some of that leftover carpet. He rents out part of it to a carpet/flooring guy “Carl”. \nHe suggests asking the other guy Carl, who is a carpet person if he can deliver to me, without doing install. I ask Carl, who says yes. About $80 for delivery (I think it’s about 10 rural miles one way). I ask him when he can deliver, he says to let his assistant let him know. Long story short, 18 months later he finally is the one to reach out to me, this morning. “Can I deliver in 45 minutes &amp; what’s your address”, I say yes. \nAbout 90 minutes later call from his assistant “what’s your address”\nMy intent was to help Carl, move it from the driveway to the basement using external door. It’s about 65 feet from driveway to basement. And tip Carl 5 bucks for having to move it semi far (can’t just drop off in garage). \n10 minutes later I hear a car in the driveway. It’s not Carl, but helper dude #1 &amp; #2. I meet him outside. He asks where it’s going, I show him the basement. He says “is this the only way in” to which I say “the back is a bit flatter” (the grass is wet from rain&amp; front is definitely more of a hill downward slope). \nHe says okay. I go inside to debate with the wife if I should give them a 5 to split, 5 singles, or 5 each. She says I should tip 5 each. As I go to grab another 5, I see they have just driven their van onto my backyard, right up against the basement door practically. (Reduces 65 feet distance to maybe 15)\nI am livid. My backyard has been a mess, but I spent about 2k and 200+ hours of work this summer getting it to be absolutely beautiful. And they just fucking drove on it, obviously ripping up grass that will now need to be replanted/etc. all without asking. \nSo now I feel like, douchebag owner didn’t deliver carpet (no rush tbh) for 18 months, dodging calls throughout, asks me for address and gives me 45 minutes notice. Comes about 2 hours later. And his asshole employees ripped up grass without asking if they could drive on it. So, I know I wouldn’t tip a horrible waitress/for a horrible experience. So why should I tip these guys? \n\nOn the other hand, if I go to a restaurant, and food blows but service is okay, I would still tip. \n\nOr am I just overthinking all this lol. ",

Shit had hit the fan because last semester I joined a business fraternity where I had became friends with many people. Beforehand, my girlfriend had occupied so much of my time, we'd talk 6-8 hours a day and had led me losing any of my close friends. When the semester started, I loss touch with her, I became more involved with my fraternity and shit had hit the fan because she became jealous of other girls that I was getting to know (not flirting or anything, but becoming friends with), so as the semester ended we tried fixing my issues of lack of communication and openness. \n\nCue the end of December and my fraternity announces a retreat to Tahoe, to potentially party, have very fun moments and really develop bonds with other people in the fraternity I haven't got to know. It is on the same date that my girlfriend and I had originally planned to go on vacation together, and I was torn in between these two events. For one thing, I had never had gone on such a trip with friends and for another thing it's from what I hear something people in my fraternity won't forget. So I am allured to that idea. I feel like going on a trip with my girlfriend is so expensive FWIW (Each of us are looking at $500 which is not really wise for both of us who are in college, in comparison to $55, but I can't bring her). I also feel like there may be fights and horrible experiences just because are relationship is just pulling itself back together. In fact, we just started planning this 2 days ago when it should have been 1 month ago minimum. \n\nDeep inside I just wanted to have fun on a trip that I may not be able to experience again, and I was hoping my girl can trust me, but she can't because I had deleted a text to another girl saying Happy thanksgiving\" when I told my gf I wouldn't reply back. It seems crazy and childish, but a lot of trust was lost because I was replying to other girls texts before her. I wasn't trying to get with any of these girls, it just feels so great being friends with people. In other words, I've been in a controlling relationship and I just started having these experiences.",

I moved out of home into a cheap apartment and she decided to move in with me - she said it was to help pay my bills but I think she wanted out of her parents house as much as I did.  Rent is about 1/3 of my wage, and I pay for it all - she works casually and makes probably 1/4 what I make. She pays for groceries and that’s about it, while I pay rent, utilities, and registration and gas for my car. \n\n\nI leave for work at 7:30 and come home at 6:30 most days. When I get home I’m dead tired, sick of dealing with other people’s shit and just want to relax.

She cooks when she feels like it and I clean the dishes if she doesn’t make too much of a mess - she gets inspired sometimes and that makes extra dishes that I don’t feel like I should be cleaning. She also dusts, vacuums and shovels the cat litter. We do our own individual laundry, but usually she’s the one who folds them.\n\nOur recent arguments have revolved around her complaining that she is asked to do too much around the home and that the tasks are not evenly split. My opinion is that she has far more time to do more chores and that I’m the breadwinner and should be expected to do less around the home. She has responded to this by suggesting that I don’t see her as an equal - and I have to admit that I don’t. I know her studies are important but she’s currently making so little money and expects me to pay for her livelihood while she studies - wouldn’t the return for that be that she is expected to do more of the chores? Isn’t that an acceptable trade-off?\n\nI want to understand whether I’m being unreasonable, because I don’t feel like I am but our relationship is falling apart and I want to know if this is my fault.\n\n",

I agreed before saying that it's not their fault and it can't be help. I explained that my parents are from China and only moved here shortly before I was born, and back there homosexuality was still considered a mental illness up until around 10 years ago. Put most people in their environment and culture and it can't be helped that they would turn out to be homophobes.\n\nJust to be clear I am not one bit defending homophobia itself, I think that it's definitely bad and will eventually be eradicated from the world as society progressed. However I do believe that there has to be a process for this and in our day and age we can't expect everyone everywhere to be so open-minded. The older generations as well as other cultures are from different times/worlds and it's not entirely their fault for believing what they believe. I believe that just because people such as my parents are homophobic doesn't mean they are shitty people. After all it's not like my parents would randomly walk up to gay people and tell them to fuck off or activity spread hate speech on the internet. They keep their homophobia to themselves and aren't bringing harm to anyone. I said that it's not right for them to be homophobic, but it's not wrong either.\n\nMy friend seemed a tiny bit upset by this and didn't say much, we then changed the topic and didn't mention this again.

It wasn't that they didn't do well on the assignment that upset them, it was that they got virtually no feedback other than what I quoted and the lecturer's husband doesn't even work in our university and had no right to be shown my friends work, never mind ridicule it.\n\nSo long story short, when my friend came to me asking for advice I told them to go back to the lecturer. I told them to say they wanted actual constructive feedback for their work, and for their work not to be shared with her husband. They did just that and it somehow blew up in their face. I'm not sure how *exactly* it went wrong as the friend is giving me the silent treatment, but I'm pretty sure both the lecturer and my friend have to attend a disciplinary meeting with the School heads.\n\nI feel awful about the advice I gave. At the time I thought it was the best choice of action since the lecturer was being unprofessional imo, but I really didn't want my friend to end up in trouble since their having a hard time in uni anyway. I'm pretty sure they're giving everyone the silent treatment not just me, but I'm worried I fucked up here since I'm pretty much directly involved. AITA?",

            "input": " \n\nFirst post here, here's the story: my car needed a brake job. There's an auto body shop roughly 3/4 mile from my work site, which is convenient as it's semi-close, however it's not reasonable to walk between there and my work site due to time constraints of a busy workday. The auto shop offers a shuttle service in one direction- from the shop to my work site. So once my brake job was complete, I would require transport from my work site to the auto shop. Normally, I'd do Uber. But my partner happened to have an off-day from work on the day that I was planning to get the auto work done, and he lives close to both my work site and the auto shop (we've been together 2+ years but do not yet live together). So my thinking was- when my car is ready, he can pick me up at work and drop me off at the auto shop.  I notified him about 1 day in advance of this plan. He grunted some comment about not liking to have to do extra stuff on his day off, but he agreed.\n\nOn the repair day, around 1pm I get word from the auto body that my car is ready. I call my partner to tell him to come get me. When he answered the phone, it was clear that I'd woken him from sleep. So I feel bad, but I told him \"look, the place is open till 5pm. Just finish your nap and then come pick me up once you're actually awake\". But no, he wanted to come do the drop at that moment, to get it over with. So he picked me up and then dropped me off at my car no problem. When he dropped me off at the auto shop, he told me he was going home to go back to bed.\n\nThat evening he called me when he was awake. In conversation, he tells me it *really* messed up his day off to have to transport me to my car. He asserted that - as a floor nurse, he **needs** his days off for catching up on rest. I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me).\n\nI'm a bit floored by all this. In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it. He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand. If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off. I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?",

Betty, who is much older, has asked this girl to not interact with Betty's friends when she is not present, made unbecoming comments of this girl's appearance, and believes that they are supposed to be really great friends while primarily taking up this girl's time for her own needs. Basically overall a shitty friendship relationship with poor ass communication on both parts. Their relationship now stands completely broken with Betty thinking she can fix it and the other girl not wanting to live with her, and considering moving out herself.\n\nMy other guy roommate has this genuine feeling of unease around her. He has stated \"I am not comfortable sometimes coming in the front door of my own house\". This is the nicest guy around and the person who brought Betty into the mix. He has expressed that this is not a good fit.\n\nWith both of my other roommates expressing it's not a good fit (put lightly), along with me for the most part not seeing eye to eye with this woman, I felt that it was important that I communicate to her that I didn't think this 6 month old housing situation was any longer a good fit. I asked her to consider finding new housing, but expressly stated she doesn't have to as that is her right, we are all on the lease. I offered to help her find a new place and do whatever I could do to smooth the transition. I figure it's good to get it in the open.\n\nShe said no. My other guy roommate has on his own asked the same of her at this point. Regardless of that, she has communicated she feels it isn't fair and that we have bullied her (probably have at this point just by all of us expressing our issue we have with her (separately)) and she wants to stay and fix this. She definitely feels like we are at fault here as well, that we are scapegoating, and that we can't just fix a problem by \"kicking someone off the island\". I just straight up disagree that this is just that. I genuinely think this isn't worth trying to work on when we are all just getting to know each other.\n\nWe all could have definitely communicated better about these issues we have with Betty and done so earlier on, but the fact of the matter is we didn't, and now we're here. So I operated with what I still have. Not defending myself, just explaining that us, the rest of the house, could have done a better job communicating our issues earlier. Thanks!",

To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we’re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I’m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn’t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn’t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn’t really the point. That’s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman’s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I’ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it’s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that’s out the window lol.

SO &amp; I came to this conclusion before our child was born, but neglected to tell her right away &amp; it blew up in our face.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been considering posting this for a while &amp; am genuinely curious to see what you all think. Even though I'm leaving out a ton of details this is still going to be long, I apologize in advance.\n\nMy MIL is a normally sweet woman in her late 40s, but there have been problems with her that I feel can't be overlooked. \n\nWhen my SO was a child/teenager she used hard drugs &amp; was physically/emotionally abusive. As my SO grew into young adulthood she got off hard drugs, but continued drinking heavily. At this point she has abused alcohol for a number of years &amp; everyone considers her to be an alocholic that will not change. She holds down a job &amp; can function in society, but if she isn't at work she is getting hammered.  While drunk she comes out of her shell &amp; is very gregarious &amp; loud to the point of being sloppy. Falling down, passing out, a usual drunks behaviour is par for the course.\n\nIn the past she's alternated between being openly apologetic of her treatment of my SO to joking about the abuse, thinking certain incidents that are brought up are funny. My partner doesn't feel much attachment to her, or a need to pursue a closer relationship so generally we only see her at family holiday gatherings.\n\nThat is until we had her first grandchild. Then she was wanting to visit once a month. No problem, we were always there supervising any/all contact she had with our son. While I was pregnant SO &amp; I both agreed that she should probably never have alone time with him for all the obvious reasons. Now here is where we I think we messed up: we did not tell her this before our son was born. \n\nSo over the summer we were visiting &amp; got into a conversation about childcare/rearing. Our son was not present so we had a few drinks with dinner &amp; MIL was already drunk when she'd arrived. She proceeds to go on about how kids need to be spanked/slapped so that they don't grow up to be ENTITLED. My SO goes a little quiet. I engage her saying that we do not believe in that form of \"parenting\" &amp; won't allow anyone else to do that to our son. She argues a bit so (this is where I messed up again) I jokingly say \"Well MIL that's why you won't be watching him alone ever then.\" My SO backs me up, subject is changed, dinner is eaten, &amp; things calm down.\n\nThe next day she leaves, cutting a weeklong trip short. Obviously she is pissed. I get a text that basically says she feels disrespected, she want's nothing to do with either of us, &amp; hey have a nice life. I respond with sorry you feel disrespected, not really an apology I know, but although the conversation didn't happen the way it should have both SO &amp; I still meant it. Then she goes NC with us for a number of months. \n\nEventually she texts SO &amp; they have the same conversation. We do not want her watching our son if she will hit/slap/spank as a form of punishment. She then says that she is not here to punish/enforce rules with the kid, just love. My SO questions her though, do you still believe it would be okay? You say you won't do it, but you think it's alright? Yes, she does think it's alright, but promises not to. This is when my SO brings up the drinking, saying in effect well how can you follow our requests if you are drinking/drunk? Can you watch him without drinking? \n\n**This is where she gets mad &amp; states that she has another grandchild arriving. She will have another grandchild to love, to see whenever she wants, &amp; THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED OUR SON ANYMORE.**\n\nAt this point we are done. We're so glad are son is too little to understand what was being said about him by his grandmother. She reached out via text very briefly over the Christmas holiday, but other than that we have not dealt with her. Now she has not seen her grandchild in over 7 months. \n\nI have this nagging doubt that this is all my fault. I feel very guilty because we didn't outline our expectations in the beginning. I also feel bad because I don't want to ruin my SO or my son's relationship with her. I come from family that has a lot of members NC/estranged &amp; I don't want that for my son. Please tell me what you guys think. \n\nI'm really conflicted &amp; want to know AITA here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I only recently learned that my mom was putting herself into debt to always make sure my little brother and I had plenty of presents.  I'm thankful for her generosity, but it needs to stop.  At this rate, she's going to die in debt.\n\nShe's always bought for all my cousins, too.  And since my first cousins are having more and more kids, the number of people she wants to buy for keeps increasing.  I've pleaded with her for the past few years to just not buy gifts, trying to convince her that holiday shopping is not obligatory, that the kids all have plenty of toys and games already, that my brother and I don't need anything, and that that money would be of so much more use going towards future expenses.  She never listens though...saying that she needs to because my first cousins have always bought gifts for my brother and I, and that it will make her happy to buy the gifts/sad to not buy the gifts.\n\nI should add that I'm 2.5 years out of college, and I have a decent job (65k+ in an area with relatively low cost of living).  Ever since getting this job, I've helped my mother financially as much as possible. She works at a school and doesn't get paid when the kids are on break, and I fully support her during those times.  I bought her a car and pay for all maintenance and sometimes gas.  I help her at random times when she won't be able to make ends meet in a given month. I've bought Christmas and birthday gifts, and I buy my brother things he wants and needs in her stead. I intend to pay off her credit cards over the coming few years.\n\nI could buy all the gifts, but I just don't think it's necessary,  especially when I'd rather put it toward helping my mom and doing things with the people I would be buying for.  I take my brother to concerts and I'm taking the oldest cousin-once-removed skydiving next year.  I'd rather do more things like that and buy gifts that matter at some point in the future than add to their piles of stuff. In my family, the Aunts and Uncles all buy the kids cheaper things, and their ideas for gifts come from the parents telling them \"so-and-so needs an xmas idea\" and passing whatever they said along. Call me a Grinch or Scrooge, but the gifts that come from that are meaningless.\n\nI write this as I wait for my mom to come over because she wants me to go Christmas shopping with her, and I'm incredibly frustrated.   If she didn't buy gifts this year, she could save that money for the next time she would need to \"borrow\" from me, meaning I could save what I set aside for her every month and could pay off her debt sooner.  But she just won't listen and sounds a bit like her heart is going to break if I wear her down. AITA for being so upset with her?\n\nTl;dr: My mom can't make ends meet without my help, but insists on buying a lot of Christmas gifts.  I want her to stop, but she's very emotional about it.  I'd rather help her with her debt than buy gifts in her stead.",

To be honest, I don’t really consider them true friends, but that’s because of past issues that I need to resolve. Anyway, we all decided to live on campus together next year in this great building: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, on site mailbox, the works. \n\nBut I HATE living with my current roommate. I believe that I wouldn’t like her even if I didn’t live with her. She’s disgusting — lets her dirty gym clothes marinate on the floor, leaves our shared sink a mess despite me cleaning it EVERY night, has trash strewn over half the room (for some reason she gets the bigger half of the room??) seconds after she enters. She coughs and sneezes without covering her mouth because “she can’t help it.” She’s loud — always slamming the door shut, her walk is like a stomp in her clunky boots, her voice echoes when we’re walking together, inside and out, and then she just claims that it’s because she’s a “sociable person.” She’s rude — she interrupts people when they are talking (also the signs of a sociable person), she is such a know-it-all, especially on topics she knows nothing about (for instance, MY job), she jumps into conversations that do not include her at all, she speaks on the behalf of others who CAN speak, she believes that if something happened in her life then it automatically sets an example for everything else in the world (such as the lack of bullying in schools? Okay.). And she is so LAZY. She doesn’t help clean up unless I directly ask her, she doesn’t have a job because she is super picky about where she wants to work but complains about not having money (she claims to have applied to every position on campus but never got one, and didn’t do a single follow up). Then she cries because she feels like she is disappointing her family. And then she cries about not having a boyfriend. That’s not really lazy but you can all see why she DOES NOT have one. Basically she’s always dumping her problems on everyone else and frankly I don’t really care because they all have simple solutions. \n\nAnd honestly, she’s just MEAN. She takes play fighting/teasing to a whole different level (throwing pencils and metal forks). And a bit racist. \n\nYet everyone expects me to share a room with her again next semester. \n\nI can’t do it. Nope. I decided to get an apartment. BY MYSELF. I’m not risking ending up with another shit roommate. I’m willing to start working full time to avoid that. But everyone else in the group thinks that it’s just so I could have my own room (they know that I have never had my own bedroom) and that I’m being an asshole for not trying to stick it out. That I’m being an asshole because they have to risk getting shit roommates because it’s too expensive living with just two people (the other girl is joining the army, but no one thinks she’s doing wrong by “abandoning” us). \n\nSo what? AITA for letting them sink with the increased rent, or the possibility of getting terrible roommates, for my own means? \n",

There were/are super loud (thinking stomping loudly, throwing stuff, banging cupboards shut) at all hours of the day and night. They're new parents so they have an odd sleeping schedule. I learned very, very quickly that they were very loud around 6-8 am. There kitchen and bathroom is directly overhead so they'd wake me up and keep me up until they were done their breakfast and morning routines. After a few days of this I went up there around 8 (I know, it's not that early but I'm a student and normally sleep from 3-11) and asked them to please be a but quieter because it's an old building and the sound radiates. The guy told me they couldn't be quieter because they had a baby and then shut the door in my face. I went to the landlord who told me I was imagining how loud the noise was. I tried ear plugs but they wouldn't block hot the stomping so I bought a white noise machine. This was an expensive machine and not in my budget but I need sleep. Anyway, apparently they can hear EVERYTHING from my bedroom (which is super embarrassing) and instead of talking to me to resolve the noise they just got louder and louder, meaning I'd turn my noise up higher to cover them. I didn't know they could hear anything until one day it was super quiet and I learned that had left to stay at a friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO this all could have been avoided if the family had been apologetic and a bit accommodating. They could have put carpets down, walked quieter in the morning, etc. Honestly, they could have come to me the first day after I had woken up and explained the noise was loud and we could have discussed and worked something out. Now it looks like they spend all their time banging, slamming and stomping so I end up playing my music even louder to cover it so I can sleep/study. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if the noise bothers anyone else, and it looks like the landlord is going to try to fix the noise going UP to them but not their stomping or slamming coming DOWN to me. So TBH, I still plan on playing it as loud as possible hoping it leaks through, which probably makes me a bad person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, AITA in either/all of these scenarios?",

            "input": "This is a crazy long post but I feel like you need the whole picture. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSeven years ago, I met a guy in my college dorm and we quickly became best friends. Toward the end of the year, we started fooling around. I wanted a relationship but he didn’t. Fast forward about 6 months (and a summer apart), and we decide to get together. At the beginning, he didn’t treat me very well, not because he was a genuine asshole, but just generally immature and I think he still didn’t like me as much as I liked him. However, it is important to note (and you’ll see why in a minute) that our sex life was definitely healthy at this point. \n\nThen, his behavior toward me started changing and I could tell he started to like me a lot more. He started doing things like waiting for me to get in my car before going back in his house and texting me nice things during the day. However, the nicer he gets, the less frequent sex becomes. By year 2-3, it gets to the point where we are having sex about once a year, not even exaggerating. By year 5, this has taken a massive toll on my self-esteem. During a summer abroad, I cheated on him. I’m not trying to defend my actions here, there is no excuse for this. After I got back, I came clean and we tried to work it out. We sat down and wrote out all the things that needed work in our relationship. Things like he needed to pay me compliments, I needed to quit smoking, and most importantly, we needed to have sex much more often. We set to work putting our plan into action. \n\nA few days later, I realized I was super uncomfortable having sex with him. I had no physical attraction to him whatsoever. I think after a couple years of not feeling good enough, I stopped being attracted to him as a defense mechanism. We broke up. However, he was still my best friend, and at this point, we still had 8 months on a lease that neither of us wanted to pay to break. For a few months, things were awkward and sad, but after a little while, things got much better. \n\nFast forward to today. He has been an absolute sweetheart to me these last few months, however, I am still not sexually attracted to him at all. We are best friends, go out to eat all the time, talk on the phone almost every day, etc. He has bought me flowers once before when I had a really bad day, but yesterday, he sent me a beautiful bouquet for Valentine’s Day. This is where I started evaluating behavior over the last few months. Occasionally, he has used sweet nicknames with me or called us going out to eat a “date” (but like sarcastically? Like he definitely knows it’s not a date), but I always would say “no…” and kind of laugh it off. But now that he sent me flowers…I don’t know, I just feel so guilty, like I’ve been leading him on all this time? He knows I’ve gone on a few dates with other people so it’s not like he thinks I’m just waiting to get back with him.\n\nIt’s also worth noting here that he has extreme social anxiety and never goes out or meets new people. His group of friends is the exact same people we met freshman year of college, which would be completely fine, except they are almost all gone. The last two left in town have plans to move in the next few months. I have no desire to cut contact with him not just for my own selfish reasons, but also because he doesn’t have a single other friend left in town. I’ve tried to suggest ways for him to meet new people but every time I bring it up, he gets irritated and defensive. If I cut contact with him, I'm afraid he would spiral into a deep depression.\n\nOkay, holy shit, I’m so sorry for that massive wall of text, but if you’ve made it this far, thank you so much! So Reddit, am I an asshole?\n\nTLDR: Ex and I dated for five and half years. Broke up due to no sexual connection/attraction but have stayed best friends for a year and half. He has occasionally said or done “romantic” things that I tried to shut down but I have not cut contact or anything. I want to stay friends both because I love him (as a friend) and because he doesn’t have any other friends. Does this make me an asshole?",

Will probably never log in after the dust settles from this (if there is any). \n\nI understand this is a convoluted question and it's a convoluted situation. I also hang around this sub enough to know this may get SHP or even troll accusations but I swear on everything this is real. I can give screenshots of the last product my ex wife purchased or whatever if no one believes me. \n\nSo I'm recently divorced. Ugly, ugly divorce where ex and I can't even stand to be in the same room together. We paid a fucking small fortune in lawyers fees because she wanted to argue about bullshit like who got patio furniture and the bird feeder that I didn't want anyways. In the end I just threw up my hands and said fuck it, she could keep everything, I just wanted out as long as I never had to see her again. Well we fought about that too because after saying she wanted the house, she didn't want the house and I had to dip into my 401k and IRAs to buy her out. Not that I even wanted the house, I just wanted her the fuck gone.  My ex-wife had pretty severe acne and the only thing that ever worked for her was this company called Paula's Choice. it worked so well that she would essentially buy thousands of dollars worth of the product at once in fear they would change the formula or cancel a particular creamer or whatever. So after all the shit was settled and I thought all her stuff was gone I found what has to be $1500 worth of brand new, sealed product tucked away in a closet in the garage. I thought about giving it to her but figured that would lead to more calls with lawyers because the last time I tried to give her something back pre-divorce she accused me of hiding things from her which cost us dozens of hours of lawyer and investigator time to figure out what else I was \"hiding.\" Seriously. Fuck her. But I didn't want to just dump $1500 of high end skin product so I figured I'd give it to my sister or something. \n\nSo because I'm a pretty pathetic divorcee, I eat at the Subway around the corner from my house 6 nights a week, maybe 7. A month or so ago a new girl started working there. I would guess 18 or 19 and stunningly gorgeous and also very sweet. She knows my name, she's acts like she's happy to see me, she doesn't judge me for gaining 30lbs eating their heart clogging food. I mean this when I say this...I have ZERO designs on her romantically. I'm too old, I'm too fat and I don't even think my dong works after being emasculated in the divorce. I am deadly seriously when I say this. Subway girl is a nice person who gives me a couple of minutes of happiness every day and that will always be the extent of our relationship. \n\nDespite her spectacular bone structure, piercing blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair, Subway girl has really bad acne. And as much as I think she's super cool, I really get the feeling that it affects her confidence. To be very honest, this girl should be out dating, having a great time, being the bell of the ball and not serving me Spicy Italians at 9pm on a Friday and although I don't know, I think her skin has something to do with why she chooses to work so much instead of go out. Again...all presumptions on my part and maybe very assholey of me. \n\n\nSo I decided wow, this is way too big of a serendipitous moment to pass up. I have boxes and boxes of expensive acne treatment and I know a super cool person who really could use the stuff. I decided that I'd just give it to her. After I thought about a little bit I figured me just walking and handing her the products really would be creepy and give some sort of implication that I wanted something in return from her. Again...I do not. \n\n\nSo I typed out an anonymous note and said basically \"Subway Girl, I work as a distributor for Paula's Choice Skin Care Products. I have a ton of extra product older product left over and would love for you to have it. Unfortunately, I would get fired if the company found out I was giving the stuff away and I hate to see it go to waste so I must remain anonymous. But you have always been so nice and courteous to me that it's yours free of charge. If you find it works for you it can be purchased on Amazon as well as Paula's Choice dot com. There are detailed instructions on how and when to use the product, enjoy! \" And then shipped it to her via USPS care of the store so I knew she would get it. \n\n\nI can actually tell she's using it because just like it did for my ex, her skin improved dramatically almost overnight. She has not acted any differently towards me so I know for a fact she doesn't think it was me. She has no reason to and very simply I felt good about doing a nice thing for a nice person. \n\n\nUntil my sister found out. My sister doesn't need the product so it's not a jealousy that I gave it away...it's that my sister thinks I am an incredible creep for what I did. She says no matter what I say outloud, I'm secretly hoping this young girl will know what I did and sleep with me. She said plus, by giving acne product to a girl with acne I was pointing out that she had a major flaw and was not a cute person. My sister then passed all this to my mom and grandma and now they both think I'm a creepy asshole who made this girl feel bad. \n\n\nI can add any info if needed but...am I the asshole?\n",

I told him at the time I wouldn’t know what my schedule would be like, so don’t book for me. It would be 4 weeknights, and I’ve just started my post grad and am on the job hunt, so I’m trying to keep myself available. \n\n\nAbout 2 days ago he tells me his parents have booked the hotel for 6 people (parents, my partner and I and his brother + brother’s girlfriend) and asked if I wanted to come. I have 3 pieces of assessment due over those 4 days, so I told him I wouldn’t be able to come even if I wanted to.  The next day we got into a big fight about it, since his parents already booked for me and he’s upset that I don’t want to do this with his family/I’m not making the effort for him. We’ve had similar arguments before regarding my commitment to his family/events. He’s very extroverted and has a lot of family that he wants me to meet and be as close to as he is, but I’m extremely introverted and my family consists of my parents and my 1 uncle I see about 4 times a year, so, although I've been trying my best, it’s been a huge change for me. In addition to this, he knows I hate weddings and I really have nothing in common with his family. I can’t help but feel as though unless I’m attending every single event, AND being happy about it, it’s not enough. (FWIW I’m always polite and friendly with his family, and I'm good friends with his brother.)\n\n\nI ended up venting about it to my parents, and my mother told me that being anti-social and admitting that I don’t get along with his family would ruin our relationship and that I wasn’t making enough of an effort. When I asked her if I should lie and say “I wish I could go” she said yes. \n\n\nI’ve had some time to reflect on the situation, and I can’t tell if I’m just being immature for not wanting to go to this event, and if maybe I should just suck it up because that’s how relationships work. I don’t want to lie to my partner about my wants and needs and the kicker is: I wasn’t even invited to the wedding. Neither was his brother’s gf. His parents just hoped that we could show up under the pretence that “we’re already here”. \n\n\nI’ve been told I can be unempathetic and cold before, and I thought I'd worked on that, but I'm worried that I'm too dumb to see what I've done wrong, so I really need some sort of outside perspective. I never really thought our difference in social needs/family would have such an impact on our relationship, but it seems to really be grating on him. I’ve made no requirements for him to get to know my family, so it feels like a double standard, but his family is clearly very important to him, so I can see how that’s a false equivalence. AITA? \n",

My mom and I live pretty close to my sister's family. I'm not sure when exactly it started, but somehow this arrangement developed where my mom and I watch her son basically every weekend. I know this definitely started before his first birthday, and it's continued to today(a few months after his second birthday). If there's 52 weeks in a year, I'm certain I've watched my nephew for over 40 weekends. I'm allowed to make outside plans and they can't/won't really say anything to protest it. It used to mean he wouldn't come, but then it gradually became my mom watching him by herself. Something to note is that unless my mom is running late, all the communication and arrangements for this is between my sister and our mom. I think maybe twice my sister contacted me letting me know the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I recently started a full time job(M-F 40+ hours a week). After my first week, my nephew came over, and then when my sister picked him up on Sunday evening it was around 8pm. I felt burnt out and exhausted, and I kind of had the realization that the reason why I initially didn't mind the arrangement so much was because most of that time was when I was either unemployed, or employed part time. Now I'm in a new field and I'm trying my best to learn more by reading books and taking a udemy class(for the time being) as well. That being said, really what I needed was time to myself, time to decompress and not be stressed out. I kind of realized the part of the deal where I can make weekend plans wasn't that great because, that doesn't account for when I just want to chill out and play video games on the weekend, or even work on my udemy class for that matter(if I stayed at a cafe or something for too long my mom will call telling me to come over asap). The next week he didn't come for a reason that I forgot. And the week after that was last week. When his parents came to pick him up on Sunday I had a somewhat awkward conversation with my sister. I love the boy so it was really hard for me to say that I can't watch him any more(at least this regularly) but it was a hard thing for me to accept. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Hey....I don't think I can do this any more.\n\nSister: Do what?\n\nMe: It just feels like I'm working 7 days a week and saturday and sunday are the most stressful days.\n\nSister: Watching \\[nephew\\]?\n\nMe: Yes\n\nSister: Ok..(looking away)\n\nIt should be noted that her husband was in earshot of this conversation. That was it. They went home, and fast forward to yesterday(Friday). I'm having dinner with my mom and she mentions the nephew. I tell her that I told my sister that I don't want to see him regularly anymore. She starts protesting and arguing with me. Saying things like I don't have to leave my room when he's here(which is BS, he will call for me and look for me, and I can't exactly ignore him when that happens, once he's here, he's here and there's no way to compromise that space). She also says she lives in this house too and she wants to see him so she should get what she wants(although at 40+ weekends a year, I think I should get at least 12 where I get the say, but you can also argue that him being here on the weekend shouldn't even be the default option but I digress, my point is that I should be allowed to refuse every now and again).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich brings me to today, I slept late last night and was woken up to the sound of tiny foot steps running down the hall. My sister is here with her son. I'm..confused, in part because I was woken up abruptly and in part because I'm kind of afraid of pushing the matter and assuming the worst. My sister mentions that their house is getting painted and that they were going to the park soon, and I decide to assume that she was just making a quick stop in the cold weather because they didn't want him around while painting. I ended up taking a nap(because I woke up \"early\") and I wake up to my mom alone with my nephew, sister nowhere in sight. I stop being in denial and text my sister saying that I wasn't expecting him to come over, and that I didn't appreciate that she blatantly ignored what I said about not being able to watch him any more. She just said \"sorry\" and \"ok\". After a bit I just scream in frustration and my nephew sees me and leaves the room(something I'm very ashamed of). I decided enough was enough, I texted both of his parents one thing: \"What time are you picking up \\[nephew\\] tonight?\" Very aggressively not giving them the option to let him sleep over. My sister starts texting me saying she's sorry her son is a burden for me but it feels hurtful the way I communicated it and thanked me for watching him. I told her we need to have a proper conversation to establish boundaries. She mentions I also need to talk to our mom because our mom said he could sleep over. I explain that the short version of the story is that things are different with my new job. My sister suggested she come over on the weekends with him but I explained that that's not going to solve the problem. My sister explains that she just told our mom this morning that he was coming over because they didn't realize how big of a paint job this would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I piece together the facts so far:\n\n1. I did mention to my sister that I can't watch my nephew any more, and granted it wasn't elaborated on, but I definitely said enough to indicate that I'm exhausted.\n2. I told my mom just last night over dinner that I'm exhausted and I don't want to see my nephew specifically this weekend. She argued with me about it but I did make it clear.\n3. My sister called my mom this morning to let her know she was dropping off the nephew at our house.\n4. My mom told my sister it was ok if he spent the night at our home.\n\nIn other words: I told both of them that I'm burnt out and tired and don't want to watch my nephew, and they contacted each other and agreed that he would spend the night. Somewhere(or everywhere), there lies a complete disrespect for me when I brought this up before it would be a problem, and now that I'm making a big fuss they're finally listening very begrudgingly. I told my sister that contacting our mom does NOT count as contacting me. Her yes does not always mean mine and she needs mine too. Anyway they come to pick him up like an hour and a half later, my mom is very upset by this and my brother in law is just awkwardly avoiding talking to me. My sister said they won't be coming next week(they'll be in Miami) and that's kind of where it ended. I'm mentally exhausted, and none of this feels remotely close to resolved, but I really think I need a break from this arrangement and I want my nephew to not see me in this exhausted, low patience, irritable state. My mom accuses me of being mean to the nephew when I'm not holding him accountable for anything and besides the screaming(which to clarify: was not at him, he just saw/heard me scream) I haven't been treating him poorly today.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

My mom has bitten me, scrathed me, pulled my hair and pulled my hands with aggression. My step father has hit me in the head with varoius objects (bottles, household stuff etc). Also they are really manipulative and forced me to do all the house work since I was 12. My mom once kicked me and his husband out of the house when I was 13 or 14 because she accused us for fucking behind her back, which is absolutely not true. And this is just a little bit of things what has happened. I'm no longer in contact with my mother or her husband.\n\nMy brother (as far as I know) hasn't ever got physical punishemnt, but this is not for certain. He's always been the favourite child, however he just sits and plays in his room because he is scared of our mother and is very anxous. Also he has said that there's no food in the house, just beer and they have been drinking for years everyday, I've witnessed it. Now, they force him to do all the housework.\n\nMy brother's father (not my father) wishes that my brother would live with him and my brother too, but they are too scared to ask my mother that. I asked the CPS to help with the moving out. Also they haven't let me to see my brother at all and black mail me by not letting us see each other. My brother is 14 and cries because of this, but my mother wants just to punish me.\n\nSo, after I filed the report, my grandma, who's always been on my side, called me and accused me of breaking our family and said that if I just could spend time with my mother, none of us would be unhappy. My former stepfather/brother's father, who's very dear to me, also won't talk to me anymore and my brother has blocked me from all the social media (this might be my mother's doing, last time me and my brother chatted, he wanted to see me so bad). \nI don't know if deserve this or not. \n\ntl;dr AITA for filing a case for my brother's neglect even if it breaks the family apart?\n\n",

Eventually, he decided on going to Disneyland. The trip was planned for right after I graduated high school. My dad planned the destination and made all the arrangements.\n\nWe ended up stopping in Vegas to see my cousin, which is where things started going down hill for me. I wanted to see the Beetles Cirque do Soleil bad enough to offer to pay for my own ticket (for this one specific thing), explaining I had some money saved up. He took this as \"I got the rest of this trip for myself\". From then I was expected to pay for everything on my own including attractions, food, and chipping in for gas. \n\nThis kind of bothered me, but the worst ended up being Disneyland. I paid for the ridicously expensive ticket and we were there for maybe 4 hours (which was maybe 3 rides and a churro) and ended up leaving, though my dad said we'd go back the next day. I was super upset because this was the part of the trip I was looking forward to the most and it was so expensive and we left so quickly. The next day my dad and sister decided they wanted to go to SeaWorld (I hate fish) and my dad got very mad because I was upset about it and said I could go (and purchase my own ticket) or stay at the sketchy hotel by myself all day. \n\nWhat I had thought would be an amazing trip to bond with my dad became a pretty stressful time. I worried about all that money I hadnt planned on spending and felt pretty resentful.\n\nTo this day thinking about it still riles me up, but recently I started wonder if I was being an entitled teenager.

Nothing serious for him, it’s just like a strain of the flu. Headaches, slight nausea, maybe vomits once every few days, messed up sleep schedule. Wakes up at 2pm and goes to bed at 4am\n\nNow on to my anger. For the last couple of weeks my little brother has been sick. And most of the time when he asks me to get him something, like an orange or some water, I’ll get it for him, because treat others how you would want to be treated, right? So for the last few weeks, while I’m home, 90% of the time I grab whatever he asks for and gives it to him.\n\nSo tonight, it’s like 10:40pm and I just started trying to sleep. The bed was just how I liked it, blankets are warm, and I’m starting to doze off. He wakes me up, to go throw something out. I grumble and ask why he can’t do it, but still go and throw it out. Then get back into bed. Takes me til about 11:30 before I get comfortable enough to start dozing off again. Like a minute away from falling asleep. He wakes me up again to get him a bottle of water. I start getting a little angry, but get him the water. I quickly grab it and give it to him. And try to go back to bed. Now I’m tossing and turning, trying to go back to sleep, while he watches some Netflix show. No headphones, nothing. Just watching the show. It’s like 11:40 now. I ask him to put on headphones, cause I have to be up at 6am for to finish my homework for my ethics class. He starts complaining about it. Now in the past, he’s just watched Netflix of YouTube without headphones this late, so I gave him like 3 pairs of headphones. 3 pairs, so I could sleep in peace. He starts complaining about having to wear headphones, and it takes me like 5 minutes to get him to wear a pair. I try going back to sleep. Now he’s tossing and turning, and starts to complain because the headphones are uncomfortable, and tries to guilt trip me. It starts to work. This is the point where I get angry. I just yell at him for a minute. \n\nI feel very guilty about yelling at him, but I’m writing this post at 12:21am, needing to get up at 6am to finish stuff for my college class.

My mom is only disabled to the point where she has a severe limp, nothing affects her mental ability or upper body. She is also overweight.\n\nShe is always late. Always. \nExamples:\n\nOne Sunday (switch day), my mom offered to drive me and my siblings to my dad's house a few hours early. We had gotten a few inches of snow the night before, and all my best friends were going sledding. She said she would give us a ride if we cleaned the house. Me and my 2 sisters cleaned the entire house, top to bottom, for about 3 hours, and we were ready at about 11:00. \n\nMy mom said she would drop us off right after she made lunch for us. We don't normally have a sit-down lunch, so I was not expecting to have one, especially when we had plans. Sundays are usually fend-for yourself days. I was expecting her to just heat up some pizza or something fast like that. \n\nI texted my friends, after confirming with my mom, that we would be there around 11:30. Keep in mind, she AGREED to 11:30. \n\nSuddenly, I hear sizzling from the kitchen. I look in, and I see my mom cooking salmon on the stove top. I ask her what, and she replies \"I'm making lunch for the boys (my 2 younger brothers, 9 and 6). \n\nThey are pretty used to being home alone, and it would have been only 30 minutes.\n\nShe continued making lunch, and at 11:45, she had made 6 plates of salmon, rice, and mixed vegetables. She called us all, and seemed very confused when we didn't want to sit and eat with her. At this point, we were already 15 minutes late, and eating lunch and cleaning up would have taken at least 30 minutes. I was thankful that she made such a nice lunch, but I really wanted to go and hang out with my friends. \n\nDespite our protests, my mom, my 2 brothers, and 1 sister sat down and ate. It took 45 minutes for them to finish. \n\nWhen they were done, my mom went on to go to the bathroom for 15 minutes and we finally left at 12:45, and didn't get there until 1.\n_______________\n\nSo, I last week, I had a 4 day field trip, and we had to be at the school at 6 AM to catch the bus. Knowing her, I told her we had to be there at 5:30 to get the bus, so we would (hopefully) get there on time. \n\nWell, she found out, and started asking me why. I responded truthfully, and she started screaming at me. She said she's \"trying her best\" and \"she can't be perfect\" and \"just accept me\". I tried to have a reasoned discussion, with her, but she wouldn't listen.\n\nI got my dad to drive me there **on time**, by the way.\n\nSo, AITA for being annoyed at her like this?

When I'm in class I like to interact, ask question, and sometimes make a joke because I find it helps the best with me learning. I find that i'm usually one of about 3 students in a class to ever interact and i've always thought it was ok.   \nWell, that was until I started a computer networks class this semester. No one in the class of 40 but me ever asks questions or speaks up regularly. So I found that every class i'm the only one asking questions or responding to the teacher. All the questions I ask are on topic but sometimes are there just to clarify or ask something related but that might not be covered. \n\nI've always thought this was fine until today, When I got out of class one of my friends came and told me he overheard some of the other students calling me annoying and \"A ass kisser\". I decided to go and talk to one of the people who said this and he told me that apparently others find the fact that I always ask the teacher questions or respond to him annoying and that they find my jokes \"moronic\". He told me that i'm making a fool of myself and that the teacher probably doesn't appreciate that I ask questions that won't be covered on the tests and that I look stupid ever time I ask for a clarification. \n\nThis honestly is tearing me up right now. I thought I was being nice by trying to interact in class but apparently others think i'm an ass because of it. I would like some outside perspective on this. Am I making an ass out of myself by doing this?",

It's quite short, I just wanted to see if people would think this would be justified if I did something in future if I ever see this girl again.\n\nFor context this happened in our sixth form working area - a pretty small space, just for the sixth formers to use. (I'm not sure what this would translate to for other countries, I think final year of highschool? Ages 16 - 18.) Not quite a library, no more than maybe 20 computers and a couple desks, arranged in what I guess you would call a U shape, with a big whiteboard at one end. It's not much but a good place to study/revise as sometimes our library is used for the younger classes. It can get quite busy up there and most of the time all of the computers are taken because of the amount of students.\n\nI got up there early today so I could work on some english coursework, at 8:30, twenty minutes before lessons start. I didn't have any lessons for quite some time today so I figured I'd work on the coursework for a couple hours before then. \n\nI haven't been up there long until another student, probably from the year below me, year 12, puts her laptop on the desk next to me and starts fiddling with the wires underneath the desk. She unplugs the school computer from the main socket and starts using it to charge her laptop instead. She just leaves it there and walks off, probably to go to her lesson. I never saw her come back and I was there for a solid two hours, although the laptop was gone after I came back from quick break. \n\nIt was a pretty expensive looking laptop, rose gold in colour, so I was pretty shocked that she just walked off, but I was also annoyed that she unplugged a school computer that someone else might need to use just to charge her laptop, which she could have done at home or some other time.\n\nI ignored it, I'm not really a confrontational person, but I felt like unplugging it and moving it elsewhere. My friend suggested opening it up and trying to lock her out of her own laptop by messing around with the password but I felt that was a bit over the top. I suppose if people really needed to use the computer they could have moved it themselves or gone elsewhere but I felt it was pretty rude of her, especially when there are loads of other places she could have charged it, like the common room downstairs. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I unplugged it if this happened again?

She takes hard classes, is a double major, and is upset with anything below an A on her work. She'd usually spend a few more hours doing homework than I would, and was usually the best student in class. We lived together for a few years before I got married and moved away. However, we still talk frequently and hang out online as we're both gamers. The problem is that because of her schoolwork, we hang out once or twice a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand school is important to her. She picked a hard field and has been selected for a couple of great opportunities such as being a lab assistant and a few internships. I'm really happy she's enjoying her university life and doing what she wants to do. My problem is with her time management. She often talks about how busy she is and how she has no time to hang out or talk. However she often goes out of the way to make her work take longer than it needs to. For example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) She often does homework while watching tv. Even if we had the same assignment, she would still take 2 hours more to do it for the same grade, because she'd get distracted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Opting into extra assignments she doesn't need or want. She had 2 internships and then signed up for 2 more, when she was already stressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) When writing a paper with a set limit, She will write over the limit and then spend the next few DAYS cutting it down to the required length. When I say 'over the limit' I'm talking writing 13 pages on a 2 page assignment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3 is what our most recent disagreement was about. I understand everyone has their own method, and I know people write over the limit and then edit it to the length it needs to be. But writing THAT much more is insane. I asked her why bother writing it that way if it was just making more work for her for no benefit, and she freaked out and started yelling at me saying that shes sick of people calling her a \"tryhard\" and that this is just the way she does it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got irritated that she was snapping at me when I wasn't trying to attack her. I told her that if that's how she wants to do it, fine. No one can tell her how to get her shit done. But also don't complain about being overwhelmed when a 2 hr paper is instead taking you 3 days because \"that's how you've always done it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know we see school work differently and I don't know if I'm just an asshole, or if she's being unreasonable and is going out of her way to make things difficult for herself and then expecting her friends to listen to her complain about the work she made, all while not spending time with us or talking to any of us more than a few times a month.

I'm currently a senior at a 4 year university and until recently I was living with my parents because it financially makes sense. It only takes me 30 minutes to make the drive to campus so I've been fine making the daily commute. Over winter break, a friend of mine invited me out to the bar for a few drinks. We've been friends for a good 4 years and he's also my old roommate freshman year. While we were having a good time and catching up he told me about his living situation. He told me how his parents pay for an apartment on campus but due to his grades not being so great, he had to move back home. His parents are Asian and super strict so that really didn't surprise me. After his parents forced him to move out they couldn't find anyone to sublease so they were stuck with an empty room. He then offered to let me move in for free since he can't live there. Thinking this was too good to be true I asked him if there was a catch. I was at least expecting to pay half rent or something but he said not to worry. Shocked by his generous offer I accepted. This was probably the kindest thing anyone's ever done and I was planning on doing something really nice for him over the summer. The next week I went to visit the place and met all of his roommates who were all super cool with me moving in. I then spent the next week packing and moving all my stuff over. It's been a month now and everything couldn't have been better until my friend who offered me the room texted me asking for rent money. I was a little taken aback by this and I really didn't know how to respond. I would have never agreed to move in if I had to pay rent because I simply can't afford it. Also I'm paying for my own tuition so I can't afford rent on top of my tuition payments. I would have just moved out but I already moved everything over. My bed, furniture, and clothes are all there. Also I canceled my university parking pass and spent money getting an apartment parking so if I move out I'm out a serious chunk of money since I have to buy my university pass again. I honestly think I shouldn't pay rent because he promised me I didn't have too. I'm going to tell him that I won't pay for anything. Is my roommate being an asshole for demanding rent after he promised that I could live there for free? Or was I just naive?",

            "input": "I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \n\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \n\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\n\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\n\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \n\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\n\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\n\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \n\nThanks in advance.",

We were there for the food and fireworks from Noon until about 8pm and afterwards went back home.\n\nBecause we felt we left early, we started a good fire in the burn pit and called over some friends from the festival. Immediately I knew something was off.\n\nThe couple shows up, they've been married for 10 years, and the guy who has been drinking since noon, now has a bottle of Vodka and is drinking it straight. No one else is drinking like this as we're all just having simple mix drinks like crown and coke. \n\nThe guy is 30yo, maybe 6ft and an easy 245lbs and he is going at that bottle. At one point he went to piss and his wife actually poured a little out of the bottle. I later asked for some, just to empty the bottle a bit, but it was no use.\n\nHe gets to the point that he stands up to walk into the house, loses balance and falls, barely stopping himself from face-planting.  I see it as it happens and try to get to him. Well he doesn't get back up, he didn't hit his head, but obviously he was only barely conscious prior to falling because of the alcohol, and the fall was the breaking point.\n\nSo we carry him inside and lay him on a bed. We didn't just leave him, but stayed there and made sure he didn't roll off the bed, made sure he was on his side in case he puked, waited until he did,  but he wouldn't stop rolling around, so we put him on the floor and he fell asleep. \n\nAt this point, it's 1am and everyone is tired so we go to sleep. Well an hour later his wife wakes me up and says she needs help. I ask why and she responds, \"He shit himself.\"\n\nIt was at this point I noped the fuck out and called 911 because that was above my pay grade. His wife was mad because now they have to pay an ambulance bill and for everything for the hospital. Her argument is that it should have been her decision, since she is his wife.\n\nMy argument is that at that point, he was spitting dry, had shit himself, was still not coherent, and I wanted to sleep. I recognized he needed fluids and professional help. I've had *some* first aid training, and I've taken care of people who were black out drunk before, but I was not prepared for this.\n\nSo, should I have let the wife decide when to call 911, or was I right to make a judgement call that he needed professional help. Alcohol poisoning is serious and I didn't want to risk it.\n\nTldr: Man gets so drunk he shits himself, wife is mad I called 911 against her wishes.\n\nBonus content: While at the hospital he started saying another girls name and saying he loved the other girl while still drunk as a skunk.",

I bought one and frequently use said card at a local haircut chain that offers $3 off each haircut.\n\nThe closest haircut chain place to me closed about 8 months ago. The fundraiser card only works in two cities, and the store that closed was the only one of its type in that city. The other city is at least a 20 minute drive for me. Meanwhile there’s another place right on the border of my city/other city but technically not either of the cities listed on the card. They offered me some good other coupons for switching over to their store post-my store closing, but after those ran dry, I’ve been asking if they’d honor my coupon card which they've said yes to 3 times.\n\nSo I’ve been going to this place, getting my usual haircut, which is basically a buzz cut. Everyone always comments on how super easy it is. I don’t know if that’s hairstylists commenting on how they enjoy easy ones sometimes or if they genuinely believe it’s a haircut that isn’t worth their time.\n\nDuring my haircut my hairstylist (whom I've had before) gets an insane amount of hair off per swipe and pushes it off my head down the front of my face. Not just once or twice, but a few times in a row. My eyes and nose are caked with hair and I’m having a hard time not starting to tear up cause it’s irritating my eyes. I didn't say anything, since I'm an introvert by nature and secondly, you don’t really want to piss off a person with a razor.\n\nHairstylist says nothing either, uses her fingers to wipe off most of the hair on my face a few minutes later. We finish up after less than 10 minutes and I go to pay with this fundraiser card coupon. It takes bringing over the manager to get the coupon added. I never made a big fuss about it, just explained how I went to the old store, it closed, and would like to use it if I still can.\n\nAfter it’s all settled, there’s a screen on the card reader that asks for a tip. You have to manually press a button to type in the amount and each time it makes a noise. It's obvious if you tip or not cause the hairstylist can hear an amount being entered in.\n\nMy hairstylist says “here’s the tip screen! Remember that?” I unenthusiastically say “yup” and just hit continue so I can swipe my card. Out of the corner of my eye I notice her face pales a bit, but she hands me my receipt, thanks me, and I go on my way.\n\nI really feel awful about when people skimp out on tips as a society. I’ve never worked a tip job so I don’t know how much it actually is necessary as far as their wages go. Am I the asshole for not tipping after my poor experience, even after what they did for me with the coupons?\n\nTL;DR: my old haircut store closed, got good coupons with them, had to move to a new store within the same chain, got a subpar haircut, asked if they could honor the coupon, then didn’t tip based on the haircut I received.",

People meet with awful criminals all the time, without this meaning that they agree with their views or behaviour. Meeting someone does not mean you respect them, and things can be learned even from the worst war criminals.\n2.

We had a good relationship, they were fun when I was a kid, and even when I was a rebellious teenager I knew we didn't have the same views on pretty much anything, but I still respected them.\n\nIn the last 5 or so years however, they've made it progressively harder to find reason to respect them other than the whole \"you're my moms parents\" thing. They've always been conservative, but they've fallen HARD into all the shit that's going on today. We have a family rule not to talk about politics at family gatherings because it always ends in an argument, but my grandfather always finds a way to inject some racist remark into the conversation. It's gotten to the point where no one even enjoys getting together anymore because everyone's tiptoeing around each other trying not to set someone off. My entire family is being held emotionally hostage because no one wants to say something that would trigger grandpa and get him ranting about some racist , xenophobic shit.\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for four years, and we've lived together for almost three of those. Everyone in my family knows except my grandparents who would throw a fit if they found out. It's to the point where if we're spending the night at my parents on a holiday we put our things in separate bedrooms to keep up a facade that we're not going to sleep together. And in conversations I often find myself having to lie to pretend we're still living apart. I put up with it because it's just not worth the shit it would start, but I'm fucking tired of it.\n\nMy brother and his wife just announced they're pregnant. Super exciting, until I find out that when they told my grandparents, my grandfather decided to lecture her about how a child needs their mother and it would be irresponsible of her to keep working after having the child. She just started working her first job in the field she went through six years of intense schooling for last year.\n\nNow fast forward to a couple weeks ago. We were in the process of calling everyone in our family to announce our engagement. As expected everyone was very excited and congratulatory, then we get to my grandparents. The first words out of my grandfather's mouth were \"well you better hurry up!\" as in, \"you better do it soon or we won't be around to see it\".\n\nMy fiance and I laughed it off, but on the inside I actually thought to myself for the first time \"good\". There's a lot of other shit going on in our lives right now, so we were planning on a long engagement anyway. We're not planning on having the kind of traditional wedding they'd be happy with, so I'm sure they'd have something to say about that, and I really just don't want what's supposed to be a fun celebration sullied by their bullshit. I'm over it, and I'm tired of them assuming their ignorant opinions have any weight at all in the way I live my life. I really don't care if they're there or not, in fact I almost prefer they weren't. AITA?",

            "input": "Okay, long story folks. They'll be a tl:dr at the end. Sorry for formatting, on mobile. \n\n\n   So here's some backstory, I (16m) come from a lower-middle class family in a suburban neighbourhood, but I am not exactly privileged when it comes to my family situation. I was a mistake child, as well as my brother (18m), and we were born into a family with a submissive pushover mother(50f) (she most likely has Stockholm Syndrome)  and an physically and mentally abusive father(55m).\n\n\n   I won't go into all the details about what me, my brother, and my mother have gone through, but here is the jist: Choking, beating, spanking (with fists), kicking, slamming against walls, getting punished to get at my mom, slamming glass, purposely keeping us up at night with loud music, burning our favourite toys, chasing me around with a needle... You get it, I don't have a very good father.\n\n    Furthermore, my mother earns more than my dad as a manager, yet does all the work around the house (laundry, cooking, cleaning, filling up gas in the cars, literally every chore). Yet, my dad works in labour, does jackshit around the house, and claims that he is the only one holding the family together.\n\n   So flashback almost exactly a year from now. I woke up at around 6am on the living room couch to my father yelling at my mother, and this was normal. So I got up, and I stood at the kitchen door kinda just watching them argue and yell at each other. Well, my mom starts walking down the hallway to their bedroom to pack her stuff and leave for her parents house. This is when my dad came up behind her and started trying to strangle her on their bed. She was on her back, and he was on top with his hands around her neck.\n\n   At that moment, after years of submission and built up anger against my \"father\" I broke, and went into a fullsprint jumping on to his back and began pounding his head in with my fist. I got a good 20 full force hits, and if it wasn't for my mom ripping me off of him I would've gouged his eyes out. After that, he realised \"oh shit I really fucked up\" and began saying how much he loves all of us and how he couldn't believe I'd do that to him, y'know, the standard narcissistic thing. Me, my mother, and my father were pretty much arguing about how awful of a person he is. I reminded him of all the awful things he has done and he would deny literally every. Single. Instance.\n\n   After a few days of tension, nothing really happened, but I decided to go into no-contract with him and no longer address him as my father, but by his name. He knew how I felt about him, I called him all the names he called us when we were kids right to his face (garbage waste of space, cunt, etc.) And going back to the beating, I rushed him so hard that when I kneed him in his back I broke a rib, and he was too embarrassed to go to the hospital. I hurt him so badly I caused him to lose his job and basically become disabled as he spends literally every waking hour in his bed playing World Of Warcraft in his bedroom. So that went quite well for a few months, until he, and my mother, began demanded that I give him respect.\n\n   They have (and still do) have this rule where I have to say goodnight and goodmorning everytime I wake up/go to bed. I didn't want to, or needed to talk to my father for obvious reasons. This pissed him off, because requoting him through my mother it \"made him feel like he was a piece of shit in the corner\" Which is funny, because that's exactly what he is. They threatened to punish me, and tried to force me to apologize to him. Fuck. That.\n\n   So after a few months of tension, my father gets pissed off at me for a irrelevant reason and we get into an argument. He bagan threatening me with violence, calling me a libtard, and said he was proud of choking my mother to the point of blacking out. I actually threatened him back, and he backed off. He realised he can't take on his 6'4 slightly muscular teenage son when he is at grandpa age and has troubles getting up to use the washroom. After he ranted for a bit more about the gays, libtards, and women that was the end of that ordeal. And since then I've continued to do the same, no contact. My only form of communication has been through him bitching about me to my mother.\n\n   Fast forward to today, and he is getting moody again. He wants me to say goodmorning/goodnight everyday. And I refuse. Here is the thing, my mother and my brother on his side. They say that he has \"changed\" in this past year, even after the decades of abuse. They say that I need to learn to forgive, and not be \"stuck up\" to my dad. I on the other hand want to go down with dignity when I get kicked out the day I turn 18, I want to make him feel like what he is. A piece of shit in the corner.\n\n\nTl:Dr - abused physically and mentally by father, father strangles mother, and I beat the shit out of my dad causing him to lose his job. I go into no contact with him, refuse to call him my father, and refuse to give him any respect. My family is against me saying I'm taking it too far.\n\nI'll provide more information if you really think you need it to decide if I'm in the right or wrong here. So,\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

I skimmed the article and, of course, found it filled with claims like aborted fetal matter being in the chicken pox vaccine, that you can’t be pro-life and pro-vax at the same time, and lots of religious overtones (I am religious myself btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI commented on the post, asking her to please not share “fake news” and concluded with “don’t fall into the anti-vax trap.” I was a little harsh in my overall reply, but not rude.

I wanted to know how she felt about it, but her response surprised me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, her mom has always been anti-vax and my friend hasn’t been vaccinated either. I wasn’t expecting this, and it threw me for a loop because I had assumed she was pro-vax and had started off the conversation with an already negative undertone concerning anti-vaxxers. She asked what I expected her to do about her mom posting stuff like that I told her that I didn’t expect her to do anything, I just don’t like that false and dangerous information is being spread so casually. I told her I just wanted her take on it and she said that it’s her mom’s business and even if she didn’t agree that she would appreciate it if I didn’t come after her about it. I apologized and told her that I just have very strong views on the subject. She tells me off by saying that even if I don’t agree with something, I shouldn’t come off so aggressively, especially since it has nothing to do with her. I apologized again, saying that I didn’t mean anything rude by it and the conversation was left at that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis exchange totally ruined my morning and I feel really shitty about the whole thing.

            "input": "About 6 months ago, I discovered a popular supplier selling damaged goods. Since I was scared of them, and no one would listen to me alone, I gave the information to another larger company, AC.\n\nAC excitedly went public with the information. He became popular, and had a huge influx of customers. Due to a mistake, it came out that I was the leak. No big deal, we rolled with it, I had a minor increase in my own customers, nothing major. We communicated regularly, until it became clear we had strong romantic feelings for one another. I cut it off, because he is married with children. \n\nA week or so later, I spoke to a supplier who used to work bad supplier. He knew about the damaged goods, but was afraid. He thanked me for going public, and offers me a discount on his newest product. I place an order.\n\nA few days later, AC insisted that we talk on the phone. I explained my feelings were too raw, so talking would only cause more pain since a relationship was impossible. I told him i couldn't go to his store because I still loved him. He said we would talk when I was ready, and to know he would always love me.\n\nDays later my order from the new supplier arrived. I put up the product for sale. The next day, AC released a statement, denouncing me for selling the product, accusing me of using him to get more customers, being part of a conspiracy to take him down, and of manipulating his feelings to get what I want. He also says I played a \"cat and mouse game\", and suddenly stopped talking to him and shopping at his store for no reason. \n\nI was shocked and devastated. I told him he betrayed me by attacking my character. He said he understood and blocked me.\n\nAfterwards, I was contacted by various friends and strangers asking if I was ok. They felt AC was out of line. I heard from everyone except FF.\n\nFF has developed a reputation. He uses people to get access to premium suppliers, help setting up his store, etc. As a friend, I had helped FF with many things, he used my connections to BC AND AC to get new customers and suppliers. I ignored it, because I considered FF a good friend.\n\n1 day after the drama? Nothing from FF. 2 days? Nothing. 3 days after, I finally asked FF if they saw it. Answer? Yes, and they had nothing to say, because they are friends with everyone. Everyone fucked up. FF is so upset with everyone for doing this!\n\nI told FF I was hurt, they didnt even seem to care about the effect on me, and that at least some support would be great. FF then tells me he plans to write an ENTIRE NEWSLETTER promoting AC.\n\nI told FF and his wife, if they write the newsletter, I am done working with them. We have a company together. It would look like they are condoning the actions of AC. As my business partners, I felt that looked bad. They were angry that I gave an ultimatum, so I told them, they are adults and can do what they want. Since I am also an adult, I can do what I want and end the friendship.",

            "input": " Hello. I know this is a pretty mild one compared to the others but who better to ask than reddit.  \nMe and my boyfriend have been sharing food, since we live together for 1,5 year now. We always split the bill in 2 and we usually determine who's gonna shop for groceries by who is going to be near a shop that day. Well.. almost. I am usually the one who makes that effort, which takes time and time is important to me as a student, he usually just deflects that responsibility by \"we don't need anything\" or \"I don't want to go today\".  \nI am also the one who cooks the food and he usually cleans the dishes even though sometimes he complains that it takes longer to clean it.  \nAnyway, we went to a grocery store recently and we usually just split, I buy what I need for cooking and he buys snacks or if I tell him to get something he will. I asked him how much milk should I buy when he hits me with \"I don't want milk\". As I know he loves milk and eats it with cereal/ drinks it with chocolate sugar, I am confused by this but just proceed to buy one carton for myself.  \nThat day I decide to have milk for dinner so I pour myself about 1/5 of the carton and have some cereal with it. The next day he asks me whether he can have some for his chocolate milk, I raise my eyebrows and comment something about him saying he doesn't want and tell him sure. That day was pretty full for me and I only got around coming home around 7pm and after only eating breakfast I was pretty hungry and wanted something quick to eat. So again I decide on milk and cereal. But of course there is no more milk.  \nI go to him ask him where it went he said he drank it, which irritated me cause he did not ask me if he could,I was hungry and he specifically said he doesn't want any, I mildly irritated said \"then you will have to go and buy me some\". We live in a dorm and there is a small shop here where you can buy some groceries and is just 11level away, and buying some milk takes literally max 7 minutes, but of course it's a bit more expensive.  \nHe hits me with \"maybe\" and proceeds to play LoL and ignoring me. I get even more irritated, raise my voice and say \"you better go buy that milk\" and just let him play and wait until he finishes the game.  \nAfter waiting on him for 20 minutes I start calling for him \"Boyfriend, go buy me that milk I am hungry. Hello? Boyfriend? Boyfriend? Hey?\" cause of course he acts like he doesn't hear me now.  \nI throw my bra at him which catches his attention he puts down his speakers and he starts \"maybe if you asked nicely\".  \nWow. Am I in the wrong for getting absolutely pissed off at this? I asked him whether he wants me to plead him to go buy me the milk he drank and said he doesn't want in the first place and after some deflections of his I get very angry and start yelling at him how lazy and selfish he's being. He said something about me always getting angry and never saying \"please\" and that he was \"very close to going but after you acting like a bitch I am not\".  \nI don't think I should be pleading him to go buy me something he took from me. If it was me drinking something of his I would go buy him a new thing without him even asking. Or should I have been nicer?  \nHe always does something like this, that when he is in the wrong and I call him out he turns it around on me and I end up being the bad guy. Last week he wanted me to wear these high heel to go eat out with him, he knows I cannot walk in high heels, he knows my shins hurt when I walk in high heels for a while, he knows the shoes we got from aliexpress are too small for me and he still wanted me to walk in them for at least an hour in Prague(if you ever been to the city center you know what kind of walking areas are there in Prague), raining and cold outside. I told him I won't and that is a bad idea at which he said I promised I would wear them and completely turned the situation on me, despite him wanting me to be uncomfortable in order to get me to wear the shoes he likes (way too much).  \nDo I just have anger problems?

We live in the United States.  \nWe met while teaching in Japan where we made approximately 25k USD/year which was enough to get by, but every month she would send money back to her family in the Philippines. Once we got serious and moved in together this never stopped. She'd defend it as \"well it's my money!\" but then use the money I made to cover things like dinners and outings.  \n\n\nCurrently we're back in the United States and making more money, but she's sending a solid percentage of it back. We're at the point where we're really just making enough to cover our expenses and not paying off the credit card debt we accumulated from starting our lives here in the US. All of the money I make goes to our credit card (which we still use), health insurance for both of us, and retirement. Since we are waiting for her degree to be evaluated she hasn't started her career yet and is working jobs that don't come with benefits, so our pay checks are about the same after my deductions. She sends approximately 200-300 dollars per month which I feel we should be putting in retirement, paying off our credit card, or moving out of our shoe-box apartment.  \n\n\nMy frustrations also stem from her family there. We help her mom with some spending money and purchase medicines for her, which I am absolutely 100% on board with, her mom sacrificed a lot for my wife to be able to attend college and deserves all the help we can give. My issue stems with two of her brothers. The oldest brother is \\~30, didn't finish high school, has never had a job other than driving a motorcycle around for a few months as a taxi, is covered in tattoos which is a big cultural no-no over there, and has an elementary aged son. He, his son, and his girlfriend live in the house my wife purchased rent free. I feel that at his age there's no reason for us to support him, that we're making it too easy for him to exist doing nothing and we're going to be stuck taking care of him forever. I've turned numb to \"medical emergencies\" and any other reason they need money.  \n\n\nHer other brother is a college student, very smart guy and lives at home with us as well. We pay his college tuition which is dirt cheap \\~250/quarter  I'm totally cool with him living rent free in the house there and I can grin-and-bear paying his tuition because it's so cheap, but part of me also feels that I'm $80,000 in debt for my university studies that I'll be paying on for a long time, why can't he go $4000?  \n\n\nI understand the culture is different, I understand it's her family and she loves them, but I see the money she spends on them as depriving us of moving forward and establishing a better future while money is still tight.  \n\n\nAITA?  \n",

I'm one of the few who switches between morning and night shifts, as I'm trained for both routines. There's not a lot of people who work in the department, probably around 10 total. Because of this, usually someone will work until a certain time and then someone else comes in to take that person's place.\n\nNow, I have this one coworker I'll refer to as \\[REDACTED\\]. \\[REDACTED\\] is always late. Always. That's not an exaggeration. Every. Single. Shift. He runs from 15-30 minutes late. I'm not sure why. I would think if there's a problem that causes him to be late he would had fixed it by now so I'm just assuming he doesn't care. The only reason why he isn't fired yet is because he's one of the 3 people who knows how to close down the department fully and does it the best.\n\nAnyways, this Sunday I was working a whopping 11 hour shift from 5am-4pm because a good amount of staff are college students and are taking spring break off to go back home/see family/ect.  I wasn't super excited because that's 10 1/2 hours on my feet (only get one 30 minute break) and my longest shift I've ever worked in any of my jobs. I also have bad insomnia so a opening shift means probably 4 hours of sleep for me.\n\nAs the end of my shift was (thankfully) approaching, I ran over to the schedule to see who was taking over for me. It's \\[REDACTED\\].  A bit later it gets to 4pm (the time I was scheduled to leave) and to no one's surprise, \\[REDACTED\\]'s no where in sight. At this point my feet feel like they're withering away from the pain of being on my feet since 5 that morning and I'm seriously debating cutting off my feet as I'm sure that would hurt less than the state of my feet in that moment.\n\nAt roughly 4:20 (hehehehe) and STILL no sign of \\[REDACTED\\], I go over to one of my coworkers and say \"Fuck this, I'm leaving\". He starts to say something but I speedwalk toward the terminal and clock out, grab my jacket and backpack, and book it out of there, too emotionally and psychically exhausted to deal with anyone else.\n\n2 days later I come back into work and my coworker I talked to before practically running out of there was working.  He comes up to me and basically says what I did was a dick move and I need to wait for \\[REDACTED\\] or whoever's coming to replace me before leaving. I argued that I would normally wait but 1) I worked a 11 hour shift that day and 2) \\[REDACTED\\] is always late, and, to be frank, that's not my problem. He didn't have a comeback after that but was still pretty rude and blunt to me the rest of the shift, as well as another one of my coworkers who saw me rush out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I've been probably overthinking this and feel pretty guilty.

I basically had 2 metal bars put into my chest (nuss bars if you want to google it) and had to stay in hospital for like a week afterwards\n\nEventually when school started in August I got sick and went back into hospital (too complicated to fully explain but basically got very unwell). About a week after I got out of hospital I started to go back into school more.\n\nHowever there was 2 people, Bill and Bob (won’t use their real names) who kept shoving the other into me. Since it’s a pretty big school that’s not a surprise but the thing that annoyed me was the fact that it was the same 2 people 5 times within the space of a month. Normally I wouldn’t be annoyed with that but since I had had the surgery it hurt like hell whenever someone bumped into me never mind someone landing on top of me. The first 2 times it happened I had to go back into hospital for an x Ray to make sure the bars hadn’t moved (if they had moved I would die)  and had to be on pain medication for a few days afterwards.\n\nSchool told them to stop but they kept doing it until I wasn’t able to go into school anymore (various reasons) so that (sort of) ended that.\n\nFlash forward to last summer where I got sick again and spent another month in hospital. Was very sick at one point but got out and just had to take some meds since then.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of being out of hospital one of my friends told me that they were in an Xbox party with bill (the guy who kept shoving bob into me) and he was taking the piss out of me for being in hospital and saying that I should just go back in.\n\nFor that and several other reasons my friend who was in the party stopped talking to them so things were good for a while.\n\nExcept about a month ago they and someone else (his name shall be Steve) somehow found my WhatsApp number and reddit account (they aren’t linked in any way at all aside from me saying about my reddit on group chats and stuff).\n\nI tried blocking them but they just made new accounts\n\nThey ended up sending some wierd messages (calling me a retarded cunt, faggot and n*gger among other things) and they also sent porn (it was Hitler porn and shit) and threatened to kill me.\n\nAfter a few days they stopped talking to me completely. I thought that was the end of it but no.\n\nA couple of days ago Steve started messaging me on WhatsApp saying that I had asked him for a fight and stuff. I hadn’t (Iv never wanted to have a physical fight in my life). He then started messaging stuff like “love you *kiss*” and other stuff.\n\nSo anyway I told my friends about it and stuff and most of them agreed with me that they were dicks and stuff (obviously) except one said that I should just keep talking to the guys and that “the stuff they said wasn’t bad” and got annoyed at me for not wanting to talk to them\n\nMy question is AITA for not wanting to talk to those guys?\n\nSorry for the massive amount of text.",

            "input": "Okay, this is complicated, and I've been getting mixed responses from the friends I've shared with, so I think I need a neutral set of eyes to look at the situation. I'll try to keep this brief, but knowing me it'll be a novel, so be prepared.\n\nHere's the backstory - my sister is 17 now, and I'm 26 (almost). Because of our age difference I helped to raise her in some ways, and as kids we often spent time together. And I swear, I've never loved anyone more than I loved my sister. To say that for most of her life she's been my entire world would be an understatement. She was my everything, we influenced each other a lot when she was younger. She got a great sense of humor thanks to me (a trait the two of us share but neither of our parents does), as well as a love for videogames, anime and other nerdy stuff. Some of my best memories were spent with her, playing games side by side, or her watching me play through something that's too difficult for her, or me helping her beat her first game. \n\nAnd then she entered high school (this was a few years ago, when she was 13), and things changed. She suddenly matured a lot, both in terms of her personality and body. She started getting interested in make-up, fancy shampoos and clothes, which I (despite being female) never quite cared about, these things have always been a means to an end rather than something to obsess about. She got her own group of friends her age for the first time (she's often had 1-2 close friends but has never been part of a group). Eventually she found a boyfriend too. And you know what? That's fantastic and perfectly normal. I was a loser in high school, the weird kid everyone bullied and made fun of, but she's a popular girl, a cheerleader and overall highly social. Which is great, and I genuinely could not be happier that she's having fun in school.\n\nThe problems started to emerge when her personality shift suddenly made me second fiddle. Obviously our relationship could never be the same as it used to be, she's a teenager and I'm in my 20s, with a job, I get that we wouldn't be able to spend too much time together. But we barely spent *any* time together at all. Every evening she brought along her group of friends to girly scream all night, which sucked considering the fact that I was trying to sleep. Requests to do this less often were rebuffed by both her and my mother (who considers me the disappointment of the family and is beyond happy my sister is turning out so different from me). This ultimately led to me moving out. \n\nAfter that, whenever I tried to initiate contact with her I'd usually be rebuffed. Half the time whenever I said hi to her on Messenger she'd leave me hanging on \"seen\", and when I asked her about it she used the excuse of \"Oh, the messages are not showing up for me\" (bullshit). Whenever I asked to hang out, either at my place to play something or watch a movie, or maybe hang out at the mall or go for coffee (I try to meet her halfway, interest-wise) she'd say yes, and then when a day before the date or sometimes on the date itself she'd message me saying she's made plans with a friend of hers and won't be coming. I'd invite the family to dinner at my place, and last-minute I'd get a call from my mother telling me my sister doesn't feel like coming.\n\nGradually we lost touch. The first time this happened we didn't speak for about a year, and us getting back in touch was mostly orchestrated by my mother. She was overjoyed to have me back in her life, and I was too, and for a while things were great! This lasted maybe a month, maybe two tops, and then she was back to her old self again, and the same thing happened, we stopped speaking. And that brings us to our current situation. A few months ago she messages me out of the blue and is like \"Let's hang out\", so I say sure, why not, olive branch and stuff. We hang out, it's super fun, and she off-handedly mentions that her boyfriend has a D&amp;D group that he refuses to let her into, and she'd really like to play. I say \"Don't worry, I've ran D&amp;D games too, I'll invite a few friends over and we can play.\"\n\nI organize everything, invite her, her boyfriend and three of my own friends to play, and it was without a doubt the worst D&amp;D session I've ever had in my life, mostly because of her. Her character was completely wrong for the setting (she wanted to play Connor from \"Detroit\" in a fantasy setting), she had almost no usable skills, and despite the fact that a few days prior we went over this and told her to make a paladin with certain skills, even going over the character backstory together, she listened to none of that. Halfway through she completely refused to participate at all, just sat quietly on her phone while the rest of us played. Surprise-surprise, after the fact she whined to her boyfriend about how \"left out\" she felt, and he happily invited her into his own D&amp;D group. The three friends and I planned to continue playing, and I invited the boyfriend over with us since he seemed to have fun, but he said my sister told him he wouldn't be a real man by her if he went. So he refused. And it's really hard for me not to see this whole thing, with her suddenly getting back into touch, as a plan for her to get what she wanted and couldn't have, namely a place on her boyfriend's group. \n\nI'm thoroughly disgusted by her behavior in front of my friends and cut contact, and she doesn't try to contact me either (I haven't blocked her anywhere but neither of us write). Very recently I happened to adopt a kitten, the sweetest, most lovable snugglebug in the whole world. My mother came over and fell in love with her, and she regularly comes by to play with her while I'm at work. This week she took my sister along with her, and apparently my sister really loved the kitten. Right as rain, today I get a call from my sister out of the blue saying how sorry she is for the D&amp;D and asking to come hang out. And I wasn't mean, I wasn't rude, but I honestly explained that we're not really friends anymore, we've grown too far apart, and this has been working out for me. It's amazing to not have someone who treats you like you're nothing most of the time, it really is. And she said \"Okay, I'm sorry\" and burst into tears. \n\nAnd now I feel like an absolute ass. Because on one hand maybe she contacted me out of the blue, like before, to get something she wants - namely time to spend with the kitten. After all why contact me now, of all times? She had plenty of time before. Not to mention even if her intentions are 100% unrelated to the kitten, what's my guarantee that she won't start treating me like dirt in 2-3 weeks? After all this behavior is nothing new, she's been doing it for years, and I doubt she's matured enough in just a few months. But on the other, what if this was a genuine attempt for her to try and change our relationship for the better? What if she truly wanted to turn over a new leaf and I shut her down? I'd love to have her as a friend, I really would, but only if she was willing to put in the work to be my friend rather than making me do it all. If she's planning to go back to her old tricks, or just uses me as an excuse to come pet my cat, then I don't really need her in my life. \n\nI don't know her intentions and this is really the source of my conflict. Should I have given her yet another shot hoping she'd matured and learned from her mistakes? Am I the asshole for rejecting her?",

It has just been too much for me. I'm happy to see them occasionally and do my duty so to speak, but it's just been too frequent for me. In no universe do I want to prevent her from seeing them, but I feel that I need to be opting out more often than not recently. She has gotten frustrated with me whenever I opt out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer family are genuinely great people, but it is exhausting being with them. We connect politely, but I don't really have much in common with her parents or her sister. When we're over there she is enjoying her time, chatting, doing whatever -- but I'm always left twiddling  my thumbs (and I try to make small talk, connect, etc.). I swear I have tried, but the experience is 9 times out 10 just immensely boring - and I feel that I need to be sort of \"on my best behavior\" - which is exhausting. What can be frustrating too is that she'll go off with her sister and literally ignore me when I try to continue a conversation with them -- or just hang out. I get that seeing her family is a part of the deal, but spending time with them is killing me and I don't get why I have to be there along with her so frequently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase in point: we went to her family's for Thanksgiving. We were there for the day, awesome, cool, normal Thanksgiving. Then, it's like 7 pm - about time to leave right? Great to see you, hugs, bye - then, she decides to sleep over. She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day. So 7 pm to 11 pm is spent watching fucking America's Funniest Home videos with her family, who I've already spent \\~10-15 hours with that week -- and literally just kill me. The next morning we are then still there until like 1 pm - she's talking to her parents about different things, while I am twiddling my thumbs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this sort of a came to a head today. She's going over her parents to make perogies for Christmas. I offered to come for 4-5 hours to help out. She was less than content with this idea. She told me she doesn't know when she wants to leave (read: we will be leaving at 10 pm and the entire Saturday will be spent with me attempting to make small talk and twiddling my thumbs). I offered to drive my own car and leave after the 4-5 hours. Same answer. I can't imagine that I was being unreasonable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole and does anyone have any advice moving forward?",

We're all a part of the same friend group, we all knew each other through school growing up, and I also knew my ex-boyfriend (of 6 years) from that friend group. It's been a few years (I dated my fiance shortly after we broke up), but I know he's not over me; I'll get texts still whenever he's out drinking, and he's expressed that it's hard for him to see me moving on with my fiance even years later. It's caused a few rifts in our friend group and at times I've even asked my friends to not include him because of his behaviour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a really tight knit group, so obviously everyone (except my ex) is in the wedding party. This basically includes all of the friends that we both grew up with, and definitely all of his friends. My ex hasn't been doing well lately, and everyone's been saying he's going through a rough time. I wanted to have my social on St. Patrick's Day, but everything was booked up, so I had it two weeks before which HAPPENED to be on my ex's birthday. My ex was invited (everyone in the friend group was), showed up, and seemed to enjoy himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day, one of my bridesmaids said they felt bad that he had to choose between going to my wedding social or essentially doing nothing for his birthday, since all of his friends had to be at my social and wouldn't have been able to do anything with him. Honestly, that didn't even cross my mind. Like, I think it's been way too long for him to still be hung up on me, and while I could have had the social another day, it's my wedding and it's not like I need to cater to his feelings just because he can't move on. Apparently he had a really hard time at my social, but I wasn't really checking in on him so I don't know for sure what that was about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

Before having an IUD I had an incredibly irregular period but I was incredibly lucky with symptoms - little to no cramping or other inconvenience. \nI do not have any memory of the adjustment period when I first got an IUD 5 years ago - all I know is I deemed it well worth the inconvenience to have 5 ensuing years of safety.\n\nSo renewal time comes up. I'm now with a different partner than last time. I go in for the appt. During replacement, I endure some serious pain despite being pre-medicated by prescribed preventative meds, but still consider it worth the pain.  \n\nA week later, we leave for vacation. And throughout the vacation I'm plagued with intermittent cramps. Not just normal day-to-day cramps. Cramps so painful I cant think, and so painful in my abdomen that the pain actually radiates down my legs and causes involuntary leg spasms.\n\nYeah, having a uterus is fun, guys! \n\nOf course this is very hit-and-miss. Some days I only experience minimal pain. Some days I cant sleep at night because 4 ibuprofen aren't even touching the pain. \n\nWe get back from vacation so it's time for me to re-commence my workout routine: 4 crossfit classes per week. \n\nFirst day back. It hurts like hell. I make a decision that seems obvious: I cant function or perform, so I will skip my workout that day.\n\nCommence lecture about how willpower overrides discomfort, shame about how I wouldn't be able to make up for it later that week due to schedule complications, how \"that shit didnt stop you from an adventure attempt on vacation\"\n(Referring to when we went on a 2 day hiking/kayaking adventure during vacation, during which I didnt have any pain during day 1 and on day 2, on our way out, I had such severe cramps that I could barely stand, but toughed it out while carrying my 50lb pack)\n\nSo, OBVIOUSLY this is a one-sided story, and I dont like that. But that's why I'm posting here: I'm having trouble separating myself from my viewpoint and I want to know if I'm really being a mamby pamby pansy, or if it's a real thing that menstrual cramps can cause pain to a level that exercise is temporarily not a realistic undergoing. \n\n\nP.s. I have googled cramps in relation to exercise and all I can get the internet to say is \"oh yes exercising helps cramps feel better!!!\" Which is why I am (a)looking for firsthand opinions and (b) having second thoughts on my instincts.

I can't excuse myself though.

I'm 40; I have no, and can't have, children, I live alone with my cat but my partner and I are happy and very much in love as we are which is living separately (for irrelevant reasons).

It's a odd group, it's mostly odd misfits just kind of mashed together, but we are generally all very close, think of it like an old western gang, that all stick together, through everything, despite everyone being from radically different walks of life, and such. \n\nThis guy, A, is one of the senior members I suppose. He's known a few of the more prominent folks since they were kids. I only met him last summer, since I basically made my way into the group in the last 8 months or so. Despite that, I can probably say that I'm a big part of the group now. I'm one of the people that is basically up for whatever, and as such I've gotten to know people fairly well. \n\nA, however, comes and goes as he pleases. This is fine, lots of people do this, but he seems to think he has this huge amount of authority in the group. Like, if there's a problem between two people, he's the one that goes and fixes (not) things, wether he knows the people or even the first thing about the situation. He basically inserts himself in whatever happens, without asking, and sort of hangs on until you ignore him, like even deep seated family shit.\n\nHe also has no sense of what's socially appropriate. Once, he randomly sat down with me and the girl I was seeing at the time, and basically sort of nagged his way into helping me and her with her essay, despite her never even having even met this guy before.\n\nAlso, he's a HUGE leech, he basically refuses to clean up when hanging out, and refuses to leave if you let him stay over.\n\nThe last straw was this week, when he apparently decided he wanted to become a shaman. All of the sudden everyone's FB walls were filled with shaman nature shit, and videos of him doing \"shaman rituals\". This is nothing new, last month he was apparently a pagan, and spammed pagan shit, despite knowing that there are legitimate pagans in our group. We ended up gathered and just ripping on that shaman shit, and we got to discussing other things about him, and his behavior, which is interesting but not really interested in sharing here. AWTA?\n\nTL;DR - A friend recently became a shaman or whatever, me and my friends got to talking about him in general after having a laugh about the shaman stuff. Turns out we all think he's creepy, a huge leech, and we all made sort of a group decision to stop associating with him en masse. Am I, and my friends the assholes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

At first and we started getting closer. Though they kept \"joking\" about how I don't love them, so I reassured. Over time it felt that they were joking less and less and just wanted me to prove my love for them. They had also gotten out of bad relationship. Eventually it lead to an argument where which I cried. after they said they didn't mean it. Over time they kept saying I didn't love them and would leave them. This was my first serious relationship so I kept reassuring them that I did and wanted to prove my affection because I did really love them. Of course it wasn't all bad as they wrote me handmade cards that were really sweet and gave me an old toy of theirs. They also talked about how they wanted to do as much as we could in life and I respected that and how they managed to get out of a horrible relationship before. While I was on holiday with my family they sent a big block of text saying how I really don't care about our relationship + that I never make time for them. After and talking to my parents I broke up with them, they texted me and attempted to call me after saying that I was abandoning them + that I was just proving their point. I wanted them to be happy + I thought it would be best if we had some space.\n\nPart 2: After time apart I saw then again at my college and thought that I was an asshole for what I had done as all my old feelings started to come back but tenfold. So after a lot of time and effort. Many nights of staying up till 3AM to apologise and wanting to treat them right. We got back together and it was better than any moment in part 1. I thought we would be happy together now. Eventually the jokes about how I don't love them came back and now using me breaking up with them in an unintentional or intentional guilt trip for me to do more for them. On valentines day I made them a paper rose, a poem I wrote, a drawing of their favourite animal and a handmade necklace. I have also stayed up countless times to help them with their fears and worries, their mother who is verbally abusive to them. I have learnt to accept myself, I want them to be happy too but I feel that nothing I do means anything after a day.

We've gone on countless adventures together - sailing, backpacking, camping, ATVing, lan parties (showing our age!), motorcycle trips, canoe camping, etc. \n\nThe problem is, he's never really gotten his shit together.  He hasn't held a job for longer than a year, and has lived no less than 20 places in his life.  After his girlfriend of 9 years cheated on him, got pregnant during the fling, guilted him into being the father while debating an abortion, then had a miscarriage... he decided to finally seek professional help, and end that relationship.  He's been diagnosed with depression/ADD/alcoholism/anxiety and is taking prescribed medication to work through those issues.\n\nTo make matters worse, for the past few years he's been living with his narcissistic mom. But it's okay because she's a  changed woman, and now dishes out cutting remarks with a smile and a soft voice.  Donny thinks she can be annoying, but not \"all that bad.\"\n\nI strongly disagreed, and after working though my own issues with narcissists, I wanted to help him get out of that environment and start a life of his own.  He had been making such good progress seeking help and going on medication I thought she was the last thing holding him back.  \n\nHe's never actually lived on his own.  He's always lived/been supported by other people, including his mom and me in the past.  After I lived alone in a private seasonal campground for a month to get my own head on straight about some issues I was dealing with, I thought how great of an opportunity it would be for him to live there full time.  He could buy a camper for 5-7k, and pay $1500 in rent each year for the plot.  Cost of living would be extremely low ($125 rent/month - plus food, electricity and propane).  It's filled with friendly blue-collar workers who leave their campers there year round and treat it like a vacation cabin.  They are all having a blast, drinking, socializing, telling tall tails, driving around in golf carts, etc.  It's just a fun place to be, and an upgrade from his only other realistic option - a trailer park.  The mood at a trailer park is different I'd think... most people live there out of necessity not desire, and that probably wouldn't help him with his mental health.\n\nHe thought the camper/campground was a great idea so I helped him pick out an old 26 foot camper, inspect it (surprisingly good shape), talk the seller down ($1200 to $800) and borrow a friends truck to tow it home.  He paid for it of course.  I told him he could live in it at my house as long as he paid his own electricity and didn't barge in to our house without first calling/texting.  The plan was for him to live in it, fix it up, then sell it and upgrade to a better 5-7k camper and ultimately move into a seasonal campground.  (They have restrictions on age/condition of the campers they let in.)  We set an August 1st 2019 move out deadline (about a year).\n\nDuring this time my wife and I were planning our honeymoon - sailing around the Virgin Islands.  Then Hurricane Irma hit, destroying everything on the islands.  We decided on Costa Rica for our honeymoon instead.  The charter company in the Virgin Islands could only give credit rather than a refund, so we planned to go the following year.  (Quick note, we are not rich and these two trips were very expensive for us.  We had only budgeted for one.)  I suggested that we turn it into a trip with friends since plane tickets were only $400 round trip.  Since we had already paid for the boat, it wouldn't cost any more to bring a few people along.  So we invited Donny and my wife's friend \"Sarah\".  Both single, but they didn't hit it off.  They only had to buy plane tickets, and pay their own expenses like food, taxis and souvenirs - we would cover the \\~4k boat rental.\n\nThey were invited in April, and we planned to fly there in December - 8 months later.  I kept everyone updated by email with itineraries and estimated personal costs as I planned out the trip.\n\nAt some point during all of this, Donny has moved into his camper at my house, begins reverting to old ways, stops showing up for his full time job, and gets fired.  He picks up a part time job where he has the option to work 40 hours a week, but can work as much or as little as he wants.  He of course picks the latter.  I'm beginning to suspect that he won't have enough money for the trip so I ask him about it.  He assures me he will have enough and all is good.  He already bought the plane tickets.\n\nSo we fly out of cold ass Wisconsin and into the tropics.  Everyone is in high spirits, I mean, how can you not be?  We get to our rental sailboat, a 2017 Jeanneau 349, and it's a fucking dream boat.  We set sail and go from island to island, sleeping in the boat.  It's amazing.  Dolphins, white sandy beaches, perfect weather, beach-side restaurants, 85 degree water, snorkeling, you name it.  Then it happens.  **The ambush.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDonny - waiting until my wife and Sarah are off the boat - \"I'm out of money, I didn't realize how expensive everything was going to be... is there any chance you can spot me until we get back?  I'll pay you back, I promise\".\n\nNow I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I say no, he can't get home.  If I say yes, I may not be able to pay my own bills when we return, and might never get paid back.  Nothing good can come from this conversation.  \n\nI gave in however, and asked him how much he needed.  After some hemming and hawing, he said $100 should cover everything.  Ok.  Borrowed him $100 - in cash.\n\nNot two days later he's out of money again.  I'm pissed.  I tell him tough luck and the three of us go enjoy the day while he sleeps on the boat.  Paradise gets me back into a good mood though, and I start to feel bad.  *Yeah... I know.*  If he can't pay the ferry ride back, or the taxis, he's stranded in the Virgin Islands.  *This alone would make for a good AITA post if I just left him there*... but I begrudgingly decide borrow him money for the rest of the trip.  On the bright side, Sarah is having no problem paying her own way throughout the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we get back home I don't really talk to him much.  The trip, amazing as it was, has an underlying shitty feel to it all.  I feel taken advantage of and it bothers me that he, my best friend of so many years, was so selfish and entitled during the trip of a lifetime.  Captain obvious senses something is wrong and texts me that he will pay me back this weekend.  Weeks go by and nothing.  I confront him.  Turns out, he wasn't even keeping track of what he owed me!  Thank fuck I was - $373 just for the trip!!\n\nI pull up his electric bills for the camper.  I charge him $0.13/kWh, send him monthly emails \"bills\" with pictures of the Kill-A-Watt meter, and allow 30 days to pay.  He's 90+ days late and hasn't paid anything. $115 behind.  Reminders answered with silence.  **It's the final straw, I'm fed up and go into asshole mode.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forward the electric bill emails, and tell him he has 5 business days (Tuesday) to pay all late bills in full, or I'll disconnect his electric service.  I also add a $20 late fee to all future bills that become late.  Weather forecast is for 20F at night.  No electricity = no heat and frozen/broken water lines.  I hear nothing back.\n\nI have a face to face with him and express my general frustration about the trip, owed money and overdue electric bills.  He does his best to act sorry and promises to make things right.  I don't mention that I'm going to disconnect the power, but it was in the emails sent days earlier.\n\nA few days later I invite him over for dinner, mostly to get the pictures he took on his phone during the trip.  He said he'd upload them, but was clearly dragging his feet with misc half-truths.  I **never** bring up that I'm killing the electric on Tuesday unless he pays just the late electric bills.  Unprompted, he says something like \"I'll pay you for the electric bills on Tuesday or Wednesday.\" \n\nHe knows he won't get paid until Wednesday.  I know he won't get paid until Wednesday, but he doesn't know that.  I still plan to pull the power Tuesday if he hasn't paid, but instead of saying that, I just say \"Ok.\"\n\nIronically, the Kill-A-Watt meter fails a few hours later, killing his power.  15A heater + fridge + computer overloaded it.  He offers to pay for a new one (about $15) and I plug him back in unmetered.\n\nTuesday rolls along, and at 5pm I text him telling him I'm disconnecting the power in an hour unless all overdue electric bills are paid in full.  The following conversation ensues over text:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Donny:** \"You couldn't have told me this yesterday?  I told you I'm gonna pay it tomorrow\" \\[Wednesday\\].\n\n**Me:** \"It was in both emails.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"That's great.  Yesterday I told you I'm paying them all off, you didn't say anything\"\n\n**Me:** \"You say a lot of things.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"What's that supposed to mean exactly?\"\n\n *- 10 minute pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"Fine, I'll say it, my word means nothing to you.  I understand, rocky history, what do you want from me then?  An email?\"\n\n *- 5 minutes pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"I don't think I've made an email since high school lol\"\n\n *- 30 minutes pass -* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI disconnect his power at the breaker.  He drove off 5 minutes after that without saying a word, probably to go back to his mom's house for the night, or cry to our mutual friend about how he's been wronged.\n\n24 hours later he said he'd be over at 7:30pm to pay his bill.  He showed up at 9:30pm acting like everything was all good and paid $200 - stating the extra money can go towards what he owes on the trip.  I tell him since the Kill-A-Watt meter failed, in a few days I'",

We both graduated in June and he went to college a little over and hour away from where we're from. \n\nMe and my others friends started boxing a couple of months ago and we've been sparring on the weekends. So I texted this particular friend and asked him if he would like to spar on the weekend. He said yes and I told him that he would have to buy handwraps and a mouthguard and he said that he could do that. We texted a little more about when we would pick him up from college and we decided that my brother and I would drive to his college which is an hour away on Friday, then when we got back to the town we're all from we would go to the store and buy all the stuff he needed and then spar at my house. \n\nSo come friday we drive up to his school, pick him up, and on the way back to where we're from he tells us he forgot his wallet. At this point we're like 10 minutes away from home so we decide we could do it the next day. Then later I'm on snapchat and see his story. He's at a party getting drunk and high with his other friends. I don't think much of because he's been my friend for 10 years why would he lie about something so insignificant. \n\nThe next day comes around and I text him and ask him if he was ready to be picked up and go to Dick's (sports store). He texts me back and says he's at a funeral and probably wouldn't be able to make it. \n\nAt this point I start thinking. So I check snapchat again and look at the snap map which is basically a gps tracker that tells you where your friends are. I look at it and it says he's in his way back to where he goes to school. So I text him and ask him if he's at the funeral right now. He texts me back and says yes. Then I ask him where the funeral is. He says it's in a town 40 minutes south of where we are from. Where he goes to school is an hour north of where we are from. So I begin to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that he is lying. I double check the snap map an hour or so later, he's at his school. So he 100% lied to me about having a dead relative so he could get out of boxing me and use my brother and I as a free ride.\n\nThere are two things I don't tolerate whatsoever no matter how small the infraction is. Fucking with my money, and disloyalty to me, or any of my friends. (Some people think I'm an asshole for this but for me it's based solely on principle).\n\nThis \"friend\" of mine, cost me money (two hours worth of gas), and completely lied to me about his aunt dying. \n\nFor those who don't know sparring is usually relatively light and you're not trying to injure your sparring partner. However my plan is to pretend to be his friend until we step into the ring and completely beat the shit out of him for 12 rounds while he's expecting light sparring. \n\nFor reference we're both 6'2, he's 150 pounds and his only for of exercise is smoking weed, I'm 165 pounds and workout 2-3 times per week and work a very physical job. So he doesn't really stand a chance.\n\nTLDR: A long term friend of mine lied to me about having a funeral so he could use my brother and I as a free ride home from where he goes to college and now I plan on beating the shit out of him.",

A little background, we both live in homes separated by a street, so there is roughly 50-70 feet between our homes. The neighbor in question has a really good base system in their home, which is the problem. When they crank their music up, I can hear it very clearly. So clearly that it is louder than my TV, My Dishwasher, and washing machine; the majority of the time, it can be heard over all three combined. They play this music randomly all throughout the day, sometimes in the morning(7am+), the afternoon, the evening (5-8PM), and late at night (11PM+). I've tried noise cancelling headphones, ear buds (32db noise reduction), and even my gun range headphones, but nothing drownes the noise out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got fed up with listening to their music in October 2018, so I walked over to tell them to turn it down. The nighbor answred the door and told me to get bent. Frustrated, I walked back to the house and let it slide. It happened again twice more, where the music was too loud and I walked over to tell them to turn it down, only the second and third time, I was greated by a different person who seemed nicer and was willing to comply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, I am not willign to walk over there everyday to tell them to keep the noise down, so I finally got the police involved when the incident happened on the 4th time. I ended up having to call the police 3 more times for them to have a car in the area while the music was playing. the music then stopped for 2 weeks, but it has returned yet again (surprise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are no \"pieceful times\" in my county, I can technically call the police and submit a noise complaint at any time, which I plan to do (when it is too loud). Am I being a dick for resorting to this extreme measure to have piece and quiet, given the volume of the music and the space that separates our homes? Also, after so many complaints, the police will start issuing $1,000.00 fines. ",

            "input": "Usual disclaimers, really long, mobile formatting yadda yadda.\n\nSorry, there's more backstory to this than the title would suggest. \n\nMy wife and I have been married for 3+ years, together for 9.5. We 'officially' cohabitated about 6mo into our relationship when her lease came up. At that time, we made the choice to buy a new queen bed since my full size was too small and her bed was 15 years old and had some extra lumps. Fast forward 8 years, and we bought our first house... and immediately splurged for a nice king size bed which we have greatly enjoyed this last year. \n\nIn those intervening 8 years, we lived with my parents in an attached apartment to their farmhouse. It had a separate entrance, 4 rooms, and the only shared space was the kitchen (though we even had our own fridge). I'm an only child, and my family had some serious events go on when I was in my teens / early 20s before i met my now wife.  The apartment space was something my dad and i had renovated together (and by renovated i mean ripped down to bare studs and completely rebuilt) but it was still at my parents and that was a point of contention with my now in-laws.\n\nOne of the reasons we had chosen to move in together back into this space involved then girlfriend deciding to go to grad school. While I have a decent paying job, it wasn't, and isn't, enough to support 2 adults and meet all the financial needs of student loan payments, cars, etc on top of rent. My parents let us stay rent free, just happy to have us close by and helping out in other ways. \n\nFast forward, and my wife is out of school, we've saved up and paid for our own wedding, then save up to buy a house. My parents are super supportive of the house buying, but sad to see us go. Dad helps renovate the new house, refinishing floors, painting, doing custom woodwork etc.  We move in a bit peicemeal over a  few months, but are close enough (20min) that ee don't have to rent a moving truck etc.\n\nNow, I'm not debating that I'm an asshole for this next part... I totally own that i fucked up here. Due to work and some personal commitments, i drop the ball after we've gotten about half of our stuff out of the old apartment. My parents make comments once and a while, but NBD. Then time goes on and it's suddenly been a year since we lived there and our shit still sits in that space. For some reason, getting my wife to go help pack the rest up is impossible. I've been chipping away at the small stuff, but the bed is still there. One of the major reasons is that whilenour new master bedroom is huge, it stole that space from the second (guest) bedroom. We've measured, and while technically the queen bed would fit, it would touch 3 walls and be a bitch to put sheets on.\n\nNow we get to the meat of it. About a month ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. He's started chemo and will likely be looking at a pretty significant surgery down the line if the chemo/radiation goes well.  My parents approached me about the apartment and specifically bed, as the space is better insulated (remember, major renovation) and had first floor connection to their kitchen. They ask if we would be willing to move the queen bed downstairs into the old living room so that dad isn't doing stairs etc.  I say I have to talk to my wife, but don't expect it to be an issue because it doesnt fit the space and we havent gotten it in the last year.\n\nNope. Big deal. Wife says have to have it as a guest bed. I've tried to get her to go with me to get it out the last two weekends, she has cone up with excuses not to. My parents want an answer.\n\nAs a point, as far as i know there are no weord feelings between my parents and wife. They've always been very supportive of her, and she has no issue when they come visit us.\n\nAITA for just wanting to give it to them since we lived there rent free for so long and Dad has done so much for us in the new house?\n\nWIBTA if i just do it since she won't help get it out even though I could get a friend to go with me to help?\n\n",

She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21.\n\nFast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid.\n\nI just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen.

You always hear about this undying love you’ll have for your kid but I just never had that.\n\nSo WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I’m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he’s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective.\n\nTLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he’s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption?",

My husband and I both asked her to consider moving into a 2br and that she would have to pay $800 and watch our 10 month old when necessary so I could possibly work or go back to school, but she said she couldn't afford it.

But that’s a story for another time. The point here is, he punched a hole/dent into a door, and since she’s moving out she will at least lose her deposit and probably more due to the housing company being absolute donkeys. \n\nHe’s refusing to pay for it. Not even the deposit, even when she paid loads for him when they were together (he was a student and she had a job). \n\nSo yesterday, we were chilling with her neighbour, and me and him had a couple beers. He knows about the situation, and being a little tipsy we of course had the single best idea ever: we’re just fixing the door. We took off some chips to match the colour, we’re buying some wood filler, the whole shabang. It’s gonna be great. \n\nThen, I had the (in my opinion) GREAT idea, to tell the ex-bf that the housing company had swung by after the new tenant saw the door, and told my gf the door had to be replaced and she’d have to pay for it. Understandable, there is a hole in the door. So, being a little more drunk now, we just took out the entire door and put it in her new appartment.

I was on the fence about whether or not I was attracted to him or if I just liked him in a “you’re kinda cool” kind of way. I didn’t want to decide until we kissed because that’s the easiest way for me to figure out how I feel about someone, if I’m attracted to them or not.  \n\nEventually when we started kissing he kissed really hard and used a lot of tongue and I thought it was gross. I tried to get him to move his mouth to, erm, someplace other than my mouth but he was like a leech that wanted to suck my saliva! I didn’t want to offend him and we were only hooking up once and I know some girls like that kind of kissing, so I didn’t want to say anything about it. We kept going and things got a bit heavier but I was getting turned off by him. After a few minutes of making out (maybe 10-15?) and my shirt was off, I just wanted to stop and leave. So I pretended like I was getting a phone call and I told him that I needed to go pick my friend up because her car wouldn’t start and she needed to get to the airport.  I am not a super good liar but I tried to make it convincing because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. But, I think he suspected that I was being a bit sketchy and he started questioning me about my fiend, asking me what time her flight was and where she was going and how far away did she live and stuff like that. Again, I didn’t want to tell him that I felt like I just wanted to get out of there because I really wasn’t attracted to him, so I just pretended like I was in a big frantic hurry and made up answers to his questions while I put my shirt back on and then left really quick.  On my way out he said “We should hang out again, hopefully another friend won’t need a ride next time.” And I agreed because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. \n\nSince then he texted me twice and I just ignored him but he got the message and he hasn’t tried to get in touch with me recently. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for lying about why I needed to leave instead of just telling him that I wasn’t attracted to him and hurting his feelings? Am I the asshole for other reasons? Is no one an asshole? Are we both assholes? Is he the asshole? I’m so confused. What is the etiquette in these situations? Would it change if we were both girls or both guys?\n\nP.S. I wanted to clarify that I didn’t feel threatened by him at all. ",

Well Jack has also had his run ins with Frank but his negative accounts are mostly when Jack has been hanging out with Jill and Frank shows up to ruin the party. Apparently Frank has a tendency to lie when around Jill and does so in a way that makes it seem like he’s trying to impress her but at the same time his lies are so bogus that Jill can see right through them. Well Jack and Jill again are both too nice to tell him off but instead just let him go at it and entertain all his lies with occasional nods and “oh really”s. \n\nSo here we are in the dorm and Franks starting to do exactly that type of stuff and it’s getting on my nerves because while they’re not dating or anything it doesn’t take much to see that both Jack and Jill must be talking and Frank is really just making it awkward for them to enjoy each other’s company. Well I had made the mistake of also letting Frank play the game as well so now he’s stuck here and only making things more awkward. This whole time I’m just observing the situation but then he just gets even worse, he was initially standing up playing the game but then decides he needs to sit down, cool, but for some reason he decides he needs to sit in between both Jack and Jill despite plenty of other space available so he initially asks Jill to scoot over but when she puzzling asks why and is hesitant to do so Frank takes things into his own hands and while Jill is still in the seat and playing the game moves her chair over from near Jack to make room for his own. \n\nWell that was a big problem for me personally and again made the atmosphere even more awkward, but I just decide to keep my mouth shut. So later on in an attempt to get Frank out of here Jack decides to switch to a two player game, and of course Frank has played this game so the whole time he’s constantly instructing and touching Jills controller (even though, surprise, she wasn’t asking for any of it). Well seeing as to how she’s constantly denying his attempts to “help” her Frank wanders off into the corner of the room and gets on his phone, and while I don’t know what he was doing while he was on there he decides to randomly say \n\n“I don’t know why I’m single... My dick is so perfect”\n..... \n\nSaying this loud enough for everyone to hear, but I guess he doesn’t think we heard him because as me, Jack and Jill are all looking at each other, our eyes giving that “did he really say that” look, he decides to say it again, “I mean my dick is godly perfect”, this time passing by Jill and giving her a slight look as he does so, I’m guessing for assurance to see if she was at all aroused by this comment, which she of course isn’t returning. Well Jack is the first to speak up and tells Frank that “that was uncalled for and he should really watch out what he says and who he says it around” but as I said before Jack is just too nice and I didn’t feel like he really got across just how uncomfortable Frank just made everybody so I then decide to check him as well. \n\nSo, and I quote, tell him, “Nah dude that shits not okay, you say some stupid shit like that again and you’re getting the fuck out of my room”.  Well I’m guessing it works because for the rest of the night the guy isn’t nearly as annoying but still lingers in the room, and the whole time I’m regretting not having sent him out then and there.\n\nAITA for the way I responded to the whole thing given what went down that night, and taking into account the fact that he’s a orphan and pretty socially awkward.",

Me and my SO have been together since November of 2018 which is not that long but long enough for us to be getting pretty serious. We don’t live together but she comes over often. I would say on average 4 times a week. \n\nBefore I left I would tell her to come over to my house every day, instead of the usual of other day or so, but  I  get off a  late from work a lot and most of the time we would get together by 9ish at night and I would be going to sleep pretty soon after that because I wake up at 6am, and the longer day wipes me out.

            "input": "On mobile, very sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo for context: I’m -15- 16, I live with my mom and visit my dad every other weekend. This last year I’ve had an increasingly tense relationship with my dad, I feel like he is being overbearing and he thinks I should be more responsible and social. He tends to say he wishes I would be more open and honest with him, but it’s difficult since I can’t argue my view as well as he can and usually end up feeling like shit. It’s a bit more complicated than that, but I’d prefer not to get into the specifics of our dynamic. He got me a MacBook last year for my birthday, but it didn’t work and said he would replace it(but still hasn’t). \n\nSo, my 16th birthday was last week, and this weekend I went to my dad’s house to celebrate. On Friday, my dad had said he thought I would really like it. When I asked him if it was a new computer, he said I already have one, referring to the desktop that is not mine and I can only use for max four days out of a month. \n\nSo today was when I opened my presents and, still being an absolute child, was super excited to see what he had gotten me. Mind you, I figured it wasn’t going to be a computer because of the chat we had had Friday. However, I was still extremely disappointed to see that I had received a Snuggie. And not just any Snuggie, but the same one (albeit with a different color) he had gotten me for Christmas, not even two months ago. I know I looked disappointed, cause my dad asked if I liked it. I knew I had to say yes, since my stepmother was sitting right next to me and she’s really sensitive. In fact, during Christmas my dad had said to just act like I liked my gifts even if I didn’t. So I smiled and said “yeah, I do like the blue.” And just hung around until I could talk to my dad alone. \n\nSo, I had a little while to think about why, specifically, I don’t like this gift. \n1. I already have one. I don’t really need another one, except maybe for convenience of not taking it back and forth to my dads house. \n2. It’s passive aggressive. My other Snuggie had been at my moms house for a while. I hadn’t even been using it, just forgot to bring it back to my dads. I feel like getting me another Snuggie is just him passive aggressively telling me to keep his gifts at his house. \n3. It’s unthoughtful. I think that, by getting just a copy/paste of my Christmas gift, it shows that my dad didn’t really want to put any effort into finding something else I’d enjoy. It seems like he was really banking on the fact that I liked the gift the first time, so why not get another one? \n4. It wasn’t really relevant to me. I like having a blanket with a hood, sure, but I really think gifts should be a way to show that you really know and care about someone, not just an obligation to buy something. If it had been slightly more relevant, maybe. For example, I had told him that I wished the Snuggie had arm holes, so I could play on the computer without having chilly arms. I think that would have been a more relevant gift than the same thing as Christmas. \nHaving these reasons, I felt like a badass and was kind of excited to share my thoughts with my dad.\n\nWhile my dad drove me home, he asked me if I actually liked my gift, as I had been a little “off” since after dinner. I answered honestly, no, I don’t like it. It feels lazy on your part to get me the same gift as Christmas and I wish I had gotten something more thoughtful. He seemed really hurt and I said I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel. \nHe starts telling me that the concept of not appreciating a gift is so foreign to him, because he grew up needing to get food stamps or go to soup kitchens, and implying,  but not directly stating, that I should be grateful for getting anything. I think this is unreasonable, since we’re probably more of a middle class family and can probably afford gifts, especially since I prefer homemade, thoughtful gifts anyway. I didn’t say that though. \nHe also said that he and my stepmother had actually puta lot of thought into getting me another Snuggie, since they knew I had one at my mom’s house and they wanted me to be comfortable at their house as well. I think this was more of a selfish thing, but I’m biased. I think they just want to make sure they see me using my gift. \nHe brought up the whole “It’s the thought that counts” thing but I still wasn’t convinced it took a whole lot of thought to get the same thing as Christmas. I said that it doesn’t just matter that someone is giving the gift, it also matters how thoughtful and personal the gift is. I said the Snuggie wasn’t very personal and didn’t seem very thoughtful, and that was pretty disappointing to me. \nOf course I was feeling attacked (unironically) by the part about being ungrateful, and started crying there. I know, teenagers and their silly emotions. This is usually the trend when I have a conversation with my dad, and I can’t tell if I’m faking it for attention, or if I can’t take anyone criticizing me. Overall he definitely won the conversation, but was he right? Before talking to him I thought I was definitely NTA, but now I’m not really sure. Am I the ungrateful asshole?",

We always got along well and we'd message each other every day just to chat and all that kind of stuff. At the back end of the year his grandma passed away and she was someone that he had been close to all his life, he basically hasn't really been the same since. However that was never an issue for me, I would always let him know that I was there to support him and always be able to give him someone to talk to when he had any issues. We would still always message and hang out after school, played on the same sports team and just overall had a good strong friendship.  \n\n  \n\nEverything seemed to be turning around again until he had a big crush on a girl. To cut a long story short he was always interested in her and they would hang out as friends but he always saw her as more than friends while she didn't feel the same way. When he asked her out and she declined he started to really struggle mentally again and couldn't get over it. Around this time he started to cut a lot of people out of his life and completely removed all forms of social media he had and stopped talking to a lot of his other friends. He would talk about how he trusted nobody and that everyone was just fake and hated him.  \n\n\n\nEven currently after almost 6 months he still can't seem to get over her. I've always been there to help him with his troubles and I've always been there to support and help him but recently things have just gotten worse. Last Tuesday the cops arrived at his house and after he told me that he had attempted to kill himself. I continued to be there to listen to him and make sure he understood that I was on his side all the way and that I would help him in any way I could.  \n\n  \n\nHowever over time and especially lately It's just become increasingly draining to me mentally. For starters he has mentioned in the past that he \"feels that he should be a priority and not an after thought\" and seems to always be needing to rant to me. Additionally he seems to be rather insensitive to my needs and while i'm always willing to help him I don't feel he returns that favour to me and things are always about him. The final thing that is maybe the straw that breaks the camels back is the fact that he doesn't seem to hold back in insulting me and making fun of me at times, often being condescending with the way he handles any help I try to offer him.   \n\n  \n\nI don't feel like it would be right to just cut off with him especially during such a tough time for him but personally it is really taxing on me and I just don't feel like this is a true friendship anymore. In a way it seems like its all about him and I just have to be there to take of his issues. Maybe I just need to toughen up and stick through but I'm really not too sure.  \n\n  \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?",

As we got older our relationship became more faceted and I think his hatred for me grew deeper. I can only assume he hates me based off of what he's said to me, and I can't really blame him. I was the nightmare little sister, his parents were divorcing as he was in the womb and he was only about a year and a half old when his dad remarried to his step mom and had me. I know it must've been hard and with two parents bidding for his love with video games, and tech, and toys rather than love it would've hurt.\n\nI always knew he hated me, ever since I was little I could play with him, and I can still interact with him, it's just I know he hates me, it's always been a part of our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day my dad announced we were going to the beach and I had an anxiety attack, it was the first time I'd ever had one which made it scarier and it was because of something that had happened the last time I was at that lake. We called the trip off, I didn't intend for this to happen I just knew I'd never go back to that lake again. After this was decided my brother walked into a room I was in and proceeded to tell me that I was ruining the family and was the reason our dad had depression. He told me he knew I would just go crying to our mom and that I shouldn't tell her what he said, I didn't for a long, long time.\n\nMy brother came into me and my cousin's at the time room to tell me that he was such a good person, because he had so much dirt on people he could ruin anyone's reputation at any time and he didn't. I mentioned to my cousin after he left the room that what he said was something a sociopath would say (I know that's mean spirited but at the time I was just in a bad mood and wanted nothing to do with him.) He came back into the room to tell me that he was so empathetic he knew exactly what people wanted to hear and he knew how to destroy people as well. He told me I was extremely unempathetic and it showed, I'm someone who prides myself on compassion, so hearing that hurt and I'm still afraid to this day that he was speaking truth.\n\nMy brother came home from his mom's one day and gave me a hug telling me he learned that he should appreciate family, but the hug felt empty, it was like it was just there for show and I'm still not sure if I'm just paranoid or not, I just know I can still feel his contempt for me. (P.S I can't remember if the 2nd paragraph incident occurred before or after his supposed revelation about family.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this was so long\n\nI've vented to my friends about his issues before, speculating that the trauma combined with his behavior, and the fact that our dad has NPD might be a sign of a personality disorder, I have a therapist I just sometimes can't hold it in, and that's my fault.\n\nSo AITA for speculating that my brother might have a personality disorder?",

I didn't say anything about this to her, thinking it wasn't my place to get involved. \n\nMaybe a week or 2 after that, her boyfriend found messages on her laptop (unintentionally) to several other guys that she's been texting and flirting with behind his back. This obviously upset the guy, so he came to my S/O and told him about all this. My partner came to me, and told me about this, because seeing as she's my friend, I should try and talk to her. I confronted her and she went to her boyfriend, and started giving him shit for going to my S/O and \"spreading gossip\".\n\nSomehow, me and my partner turned out to be the cause of they argument, which we weren't keen on being involved in in the first place. And we lost touch for most of the summer.\n\nWhen I came back to university in September, my friend and I briefly met up with another mutual friend of ours, we seemed to talk it out, and come to the conclusion that what happened during the summer wasn't anyone's fault and it was just a big misunderstanding where everyone ended up getting heated and overreacting. This was fine, we ended up talking and stuff again, seemed like everything was behind us.\n\nRecently we met up again, she had a few drinks and accidentally let it slip to us that she was planning to break up with her boyfriend after she finds her own place to move into, because she \"doesn't see it going anywhere\" .. \"he's just not (her ex's name)..\"I just need a place to stay at the moment and have nowhere else to go\". This surpised and shocked me, and I asked her is she sure she wants to break up because them two seem to work so well.\n\nAt the end of the night, I came home to my partner and tell him about this as it was kind of concerning me. He told me that he was thinking of just going to her boyfriend and telling him about this, as she is just using him and it isn't fair on the guy. I thought it was the right thing to do, so I ended up texting my friend and gave her a heads up. Basically saying \"hey look, I told my S/O about what you said, with all the breaking up and stuff, sorry, I know it wasn't my place, but it didn't seem fair\" she then came at me saying that she had never said that she was definitely going to break up with him (she did), etc. And that now she's gonna have to deal with that, thanks a lot.\nMy partner didn't even bother contacting the guy anyway though. \n\nI dismissed these as I knew she had a few drinks earlier that night, but she texted me the next day saying that I've always been a horrible friend, and that I only ever met up with her and our other friend to get the gossip, and then \"report back to your keeper\" which I found absurt and laughable to be honest.\n\nI have since stopped talking to her, blocked her on social media. I did see her a couple of days ago and we exchanged a few words, in which she informed me that she has in fact broken up with her boyfriend and that she has found a new place to live in, etc. I'm just not sure if I was an asshole in this, telling my boyfriend in confidence something that was bothering me.\n\nTL;DR: ex friend was using her boyfriend, his money, car, house, etc. She was planning to break up with him as soon as she had backup, and told me this. I told my S/O about this as he is friends with her boyfriend. He wanted to text him to warn him, I talked him out of it, but still told my friend that I had told him. She flipped out and started insulting me saying that I can't keep my mouth shut",

However, my BIL was in a great rehab facility for a few years with his own little but growing family.  My family have bought them clothes, grocery gift cards, even electronics to help them out.  We were so proud of the BIL and his family for trying to stay off drugs and working to move them out of rehab.  An example of what we do for them: One Thanksgiving weekend, I drove 140 miles round trip (twice) from home to the facility to pick up this family so they'd be home for the holidays. \n\nOne day, BIL gets kicked out of the facility. Not 100% sure why but whatever the reason was, BIL couldn't return for 3 months.  We get the call and we told him, \"Move in with us.  Let's find you a job...\" all the supportive stuff.  Instead, he moves in with his father (my FIL) and they start smoking.  Years of rehab down the drain.  It was like all the support we gave him didn't matter.  We tried talking to the FIL as well but he didn't care... he had his drug using best friend back (FIL and the rest of the in laws need their own thread).\n\nWe don't want to be anywhere where they're present.

The in laws are pissed at us that just because they took everything we've done for granted, we're still supposed to see them and support them, including buying them more stuff, giving them rides, etc.  Just because they're family?

I've been there for 2.5 years, she has been there for 9 months. Much of our job consists of running programs, driving the bus, and basically being in front of people (seniors and sometimes their families) and running the show. She was born in Canada and only speaks English, fluently (relevant).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday we ran a Scottish Trivia program together. She said she'd read over the questions beforehand. There were about 60 people in attendance, we were up at the front switching the mic back and forth doing the trivia questions. A few times she pronounced words wrong, so I quietly whispered to her the correct pronunciation, because from my point of view it was clear the seniors didn't know what she was talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout halfway through she read the question \"Who is the patron saint of Scotland?\", however she read it as \"pah-trohn\", like the alcohol. People chuckled/laughed, so did I, because it was funny. An alcohol saint of Scotland, hilarious! No big deal. Or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the program, with our door and our bosses door (right next to ours) wide open, she asks if she can talk to me. She says that she feels very embarrassed when I correct her pronunciation doing a group activity like we were, and that she was bullied for it a lot in school and she gets a lot of anxiety about it. I reply saying that that obviously was not my intention to make her feel bad and I apologize. She replies saying I do this all the time and she's very sensitive about it (she mispronounced things a fair bit). I reply saying I only clarified the words because the seniors couldn't understand what she was trying to say, and I was not laughing at her or making fun of her. I offered for next time to go through the material with her beforehand to see if there are any words she is unsure of how to say, and I will help her. She replies saying no, it's just an anxiety thing, I get so much anxiety being in front of people already so it just happens. At this point we get interrupted and our conversation ends there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see her point of view - I know she has issues with anxiety, etc. However, the way I would have handled it (and did, because I pronounced some Scottish words wrong too), was to laugh it off and be a part of the joke, rather than taking it as a personal attack, which it wasn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's had anxiety issues with this job before, and this was the 3rd issue in 24 hours (the first being she had too much anxiety to drive the bus, so I had to drive, the second being refusing to do a lip sync thing for an event we have planned for April, the third was this event). She's taken MANY days off due to anxiety, as in drained her whole sick bank and then a couple weeks on top of that. The majority of our job is to be in front of people and be entertaining - if that causes this level of anxiety, why work in this job at all? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

A civil relationship for the child's benefit is all that is necessary.\n\nLisa joined a sports team this year, and the year-end banquet is coming up, at a restauraunt 10 minutes from my home. Ariana informed me that she would like to attend. I requested that since Ariana attended the first game of the year (which was scheduled on 'my' day) that I be able attend the banquet (which also happens to be scheduled on 'my' day) alone this year, and she attend next year's banquet. Ariana replied that she would be there \"no matter who has her that day\". She offered to sit at a separate table and that Lisa would sit with me. \n\nI explained to her that I did not think it was best for Lisa to have both parents at the event, but only be able to sit with one, and that sitting together was out of the question - I have no interest in conversing with Ariana. I reiterated my request to switch who takes her each year, and that I be able to take her to the first one (since she attended the first game). \n\nAfter a few more exchanges with this same story playing out, she informed me she had explained to Lisa (she was home with her at the time) the situation, and had explained my feelings about not wanting to sit at the same table with Ariana, while in the same email explaining my feelings incorrectly.\n\nI told her that I didn't think it was the right thing to do to put Lisa in the middle of this argument, and that it wasn't her place to tell Lisa how I felt about the situation. I informed her that constituted disparaging me to Lisa, and was justiciable - then told her not to do it again. \n\nI then told her that I had discussed the situation with Lisa (I waited a day so I could discuss it with her in person), and that Lisa did not want to be put in a situation where she had to choose between her parents, and that Ariana will be taking Lisa to the banquet by themselves this year, and that I would like to take Lisa myself next year. I also included that Lisa said this seemed a fair way to do it. I know this seems hypocritical considering I just called Ariana out for it, however... damage control.\n\nAriana replied that she is not taking Lisa to the banquet just because I decided she would, since it will be 'my' day - that I needed to make it work. She said if she finds out that Lisa doesn't go because I was \"too busy\" that day, it's my fault that Lisa was unable to attend. \n\nTL/DR - I wanted to take her by myself. She said no, she's coming too. I said, fine, you take her. She said, no, you bring her and if you don't you're the parent at fault. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

I was 12 when I first asked to take me home instead because I didn’t want to go. There’s so many reasons to list why, but in summary; he picked on my weight - subtle digs here and there, roll his eyes whenever I said something and never made me feel appreciated or loved. I’ve never heard him say that he was proud of me despite my achievements. There’s so many more things to go on about, like how he didn’t come to important events in my life, like my 18th birthday, or how he would prevent my mum from swapping weekends around so I could spend time with family. \n\nMy father got into a relationship with his now fiancée 3 years ago. About 10 months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent surgery and the cancer was removed. She’s in the process of radiation treatment now and is slowly getting better.\n\nLast time I saw them, we went into the city and it was fine. He made some horrible remarks about how much money he makes which made the day turn sour. Like I mentioned before, his fiancée is currently undergoing treatment for her cancer and so she has had to have some time off work up until recently. He made a ‘joke’ about how he “makes more money at home on the couch than she does at work” and how he has “been holding up this family.” This made me so angry because he has never provided for me and he was belittling his fiancée. My father never offered to pay for my books for high school or uniforms. My mother supported me to get to where I am now by herself. The only time he would pay for anything was when she begged him to. My mum is a single parent, who up to very recently had a small income that only went to the necessities and she really struggled with anything else. So, it’s fair to say that I didn’t see much support from him.\n\nI decided to stop speaking to him from that moment forward. I had removed him from Facebook and haven’t had any contact with him since I saw him in January. Monday just gone, I had gotten a phone call around 9:30pm from his fiancée. I was an emotional wreck, talking about my father the last few months has been a major trigger point for me and causes panic attacks and breakdowns. It’s not pretty. She told me that her cancer has a high likelihood of coming back and that she has a 6% chance of survival on the next 5 years.\n\nAfter that call, I was in hysterics. I had to explain to her why I didn’t want to see them because of my father and I was just told she may not be here in 5 years time. \n\ntl;dr: My father made my life hell, I cut him off, I found out my step mum has a small chance of living in the next 5 years after speaking to them for the first time in 2 months.",

I'm gonna give the tip based on the service that was given to me and the service sucked\".

I'm just not as attracted to this guy anymore. (for the record, I am bi with a large preference towards girls.) \n\nAnyway. My boyfriend, (let's call him Jack) was always really into me.

The transition might've had something to do with it, but I feel it's just mostly me. I'm just not feeling it anymore.\n\n This especially sucks because I know Jack has been having some serious mental health problems. His mother (also we're teens, forgot to mention that) has been borderline abusive, being completely against his transition and going as far as to slag him off sometimes, and his brother has been doing the same. His father lives elsewhere and has been having drinking/substance problems, and thus Jack's been feeling pretty abandoned. His school life is bad, he's falling back in his classes and some of his former friends have been incredibly toxic towards him. Basically he's pretty mentally unstable. (And he also goes to a therapist every week.) \n\nI'm worried if I break it off I'll push him over the edge. I know his mental state has apparently been improving thanks to our relationship and I don't want to see him regress, but I'm also just not happy at all. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I broke up with my poor, mentally and emotionally unstable, trans boyfriend?

We added each other to our friends lists and started talking almost every day for the next few months. We exchanged pictures (not nudes) and video chatted a little bit every now and then. Now this girl looked like an absolute 9/10. I started to fall for this girl’s personality and looks, also the fact she played my favourite game with me really helped. \n\nOver time one thing led to another and we started a long-distance relationship in early December. I booked a flight out to Berlin for the 17th until the 23rd to go meet the girl of my dreams. I was going to stay at her home, and she was going to pick me up from the airport.\n\nMy Dad took me to the airport and wished me good luck. Everything was normal that day, we had chatted all morning until I got on the plane. The wheels hit the ground at Berlin Schönefeld Airport, and I was ready. I get off the plane and text her to let her know I was here. I go through passport control and I'm stood outside the arrivals door knowing that the girl of my dreams is on the other side of that door, heart pounding, anxiety levels at maximum wondering if I'm going to be good enough for her. Nothing could have prepared me for what was through that door...\n\nI find the courage after a few minutes of calming myself down and I walk through the door. I look up and down the line of people, but she is nowhere to be seen. I start wondering if she had bailed last minute. All of a sudden, what I can only describe as the female version of an extremely obese Danny DeVito who had been hit in the face with a shovel comes waddling out of the crowd calling my name. My heart dropped and all I could do was smile and wave. The first things through my head were the fact that I would be having to live with this goblin for the next six days and make sure I don't break her heart because I needed somewhere to stay and a lift back to the airport. \n\nWe embrace in a hug as I devise my plan on how to make sure I don't completely destroy the mental stability of this already fragile girl. We go back to her house and she starts getting frisky. I don't like it, but if I don't go through with it, she will know something is wrong. Never in my life would I have thought, as a man, that I would have to fake an orgasm. \n\nI just have to grit my teeth and get through these six days then I can be back in the safety of my own home. Now obviously this girl was not the girl in her pictures. WRONG. She was, but she was an absolute professional at camera angles and lighting and somehow managed to maintain that perfect angle in all her photos and during our video calls. \n\nI got home and couple of days later I come up with some bullshit about how I can't deal with the stress of a long-distance relationship and that was my reason for breaking it off.

No text or anything at all until he called me at 9:30 saying he was getting food from my favorite restaurant and offered to bring me some even though I already ate. \n\nObviously, I accepted, figuring this was his way of apologizing, so I met him at his place and we ate at 10.

Of course I said it was ok, but he played for 2 and a half hours. He is a loud talker, but when he has headphones in he fucking yells so loud.

I went on an overnight trip with my coworkers from a previous company two years ago and my spouse was having some trust-issues regarding a certain coworker who I'm good friends with, and I don't want him to have these issues again with my new set of coworkers, so I'd rather just have none of us attend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thought-process / reasoning below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'd feel bad if my spouse took a spot that a coworker could have taken\\*\\*. I know, I know, other people are inviting their SOs so I shouldn't feel bad, but all of the other plus ones being invited are people that we (coworkers) know. They come out to our company's happy hours, holiday parties, etc. Even though I've been at the company longer than a lot of the people inviting their spouses, not many people coming on the trip have ever met my spouse. My spouse doesn't attend our events mainly due to noise-anxiety (tinnitus-related) &amp; the fact that we live a bit farther from the office than the others (30-40 minute drive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my spouse knew the rest of my coworkers, I would feel comfortable bringing them along. Yes, this would be a great opportunity for them to get to meet my coworkers, but it's also a trip with a limited number of spots. Our happy hours and events happen frequently, do not have a guest-capacity, and some (the monthly ones) are tolerable as far as noise-anxiety and loudness are concerned (according to my spouse).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'm also afraid of putting my spouse into an uncomfortable position regarding tinnitus and sleeping\\*\\*. This is less of a concern because my spouse is an adult and clearly if they knew there was a risk they wouldn't attend the trip, but I still can't help but worry a bit. My spouse struggles to sleep at night due to their tinnitus. They often sit in the kitchen with the faucet running in order to fall asleep. My spouse wouldn't have that option in a shared cabin with coworkers. They've struggled with sleeping on overnight trips in the past  and it would be difficult if they felt trapped on this overnight trip that's about 4 hours away from home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR- My spouse was looking forward to attending an overnight trip with myself, my coworkers, and their SOs. WIBTA if I decide that neither of us will be attending the trip?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I moved up two year levels from year 9 to year 11 (level one) and she moved up one year 10 to 11 in math 2 years ago, ahead of her, then she stopped competing over math, and at the end of last year dropped back a year to do calculus, as originally she'd gone into statistics (I was in calculus so we didn't worry about class over lap). All was good until this year I joked about visiting her physics class to confuse the teacher. She didn't know it was a joke, she wasn't listening fully, got really serious and said \"**Don't.**\" after I told her it was a joke she relaxed a bit and I laughed it off. She said it some more times over the next couple days about not doing physics, at that point I had no intention on doing it.\n\nRight now I'm in 13 calculus (level three) I'm ahead of the year 13's and working on my own thing, my year 12 calculus teacher came up one day said I should move into year 12 physics (level two), I dismissed it because of my sister but wanted to do it. The next day I had my second science lesson, the first one was boring. I found out it would be recap for at least half a term and probably more, I just felt constrained. I thought about moving up to level two physics and possibly level two chemistry. That evening on the way home I casually mentioned moving up in science, my mum was immediately hooked and started sorting out the details with me. Up until this point I hadn't seriously thought about moving up, just some maybes in my mind. My mum sorted out the class changes and I got moved up into the subjects (my mum is a teacher) and it turned out there's only one physics class and one chemistry class so I'm in two of her classes. I attended one physics lesson when my sister was sick and that's all I've had.\n\nToday I went with her to her job interview to calm her a bit she was thankful.

Saying I ruined her love life and that I was horrible to her constantly. I felt disgusted by it for a week before I told K, and he let it simmer until I claimed it really bothered me, instantaneously deleting all of her hate and banning her.\n\nShe attempted to shoot me a friend request in October, in which I politely told her to screw off.\n\nLooking back on old messages, I don't think I'm in the wrong.

I've always been very understanding and supportive of that, going out of my way to make her feel beautiful and comfortable in her skin and recently we even started showering together! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, about 4 months ago she got an IUD. Was totally on board, and regardless it's her body and thus her decision. Since then though, there's been two issues that I have not mentioned in hopes that they would either go away naturally or she might notice herself. Firstly, she has been spotting a LOT. Like every single time we have sex now I feel as if I am literally murderin' dat pussy. I'm probably in the minority here but I'm not particularly a big fan of blood in general and still have mental scars from an incident of going down on a girl on her period unknowingly. That's the lesser of the two issues though. She has also started to smell progressively worse down there ever since the IUD, to the point that I can often smell her outside her pants if I get too close and smells kind of like B.O mixed with urine – not exactly appealing. I do have a pretty sensitive sense of smell, but it's blatantly obvious now and shocking to me that she hasn't noticed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway last night she asked me why I haven't been going down on her lately and I felt as if I had to be honest with her about it. I made it known it wasn't towards her personally, placed the blame on the IUD and how I've noticed it only since then, and tried to play it off like it wasn't as big of a deal as I've actually been finding it. She was still extremely hurt and instantly went to the shower where I heard her crying. I felt like absolute shit for the rest of the night and was thinking I just shouldn't have said anything. This morning I heard her make an appointment to get the IUD removed. ",

I think it’s better to have conversations with her about the content than to just eliminate it entirely. Writing this out feels kind of dumb, but my husband is legitimately pissed at me, so am I the asshole?",

The job is easy, for the most part, but she’s never around because of this. Before she started working, we’d be able to see each other a lot. As most relationships work. But now that she’s scheduled for a majority of the week every week, she’s never around. But that’s the least of my worries.\n\nShe has a second job, the job she worked before the job she has now. She only covers people’s shifts sometimes, and because of this she takes shifts on days she has off. She works too much. Not because I won’t be able to see her, but because she has no time to eat. She wasn’t like this before working her new job. She keeps picking at her fingers, to the point where it hurts her. She’s constantly stressed out, and has little to no time to do her homework at home so she does it in school. Her parents have told her that they’re not forcing her to work, and she can quit if she wants to. I feel bad because I encouraged her to apply to her new job, and now I realize that it might not be the best for her to work there anymore. \n\nWe were texting last night, and she was super anxious because she felt like she ate too many gummy bears. Because recently, she’s been eating almost nothing all day. The past month or so, she just hasn’t been herself. She was scheduled for every day this week minus Thursday, but she took off Friday and Saturday to be with her best friend on their birthday. Thursday, she took a shift at her other job. I do honestly think she works way too much, and it’s not healthy for her.\n\nHere’s where the AITA part kicks in. I don’t want her to quit, even if it may be better for her. If I told her how I feel about this, I know she’ll overthink it and think too much into it. She’ll probably think that I do want her to quit, and she’ll think she’s a bad girlfriend because she’s always at work and never has time for me (which isn’t true on the weekends, but I have work Sunday so we can only go out Saturday and whenever she doesn’t have work.) She’s not a bad girlfriend at all, and I don’t want her to think that. She has before, for similar reasons, and I don’t think it’s fair that she has to think into things like this so much. I don’t know if I can tell her. The earliest I can see her is probably Tuesday, since I have work Sunday and Monday and she’s going to be at her friends’ for her birthday. Help me out please, because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want her to feel down like this. I don’t want her stressing out so much because she doesn’t eat because of work. But I don’t want her to overthink everything, and maybe feel worse if I did tell her.",

Tha'ts another story all together but necessary to set the stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is where AITA comes in.  About 3 months ago, I was curious as to why my gf and I didn't put anything on Facebook about how we were dating or mark it as \"in a relationship with xxx\".  She was adamant she doesn't use Facebook and that its old.  Huh okay I get that, a lot of people trended away from that and she is always on IG.  Anyway curiosity got the best of me and I found the Facebook.  The most recent activity was while we were dating and it was one of her older pics on IG uploaded with some caption I knew my gf wouldn't write. Well I brought it up to my gf and she said her mom has the account and looks on there. She's known of this and let it happen.  I told her it wasn't okay and made me uncomfortable.  I asked to have it deleted but she said she didn't want to fight with her mom over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understood and let it go.  Until last night she mentioned a story about how her mom had just shown her messages from kids she went to highschool with dming her being typical creepy in her messages.  She says her mom ignores it but this was past my boundaries and really upset me.  I got really mad and told her that this needs to stop and it needs to be deleted. I made her text her mom right then and get rid of the account. Its still there....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked into it more and did some grade C detective work to see if she used the account (she didn't accept my friend request from months prior).  I looked at some of the likes and checked those account's profile pictures to see if my gf's name appeared. Shocker... they did. I got absolutely furious about how this makes me look and how this needs to change or our relationship will not continue.  I don't want to put my gf against her mom but she is abusive and its ruining our relationship.

After dinner, the guys migrated to watch the football game, and the women disappeared again. I thought they just didn't like football. It turns out that the women spend 2 hours before the meal cooking, folding napkins, setting tables, etc. Then after the meal, the women spend another hour or two doing dishes and cleaning. By the time they were done cleaning, everyone was preparing to leave.\n\nThe next holiday, aunt-in-law mentioned that the women would like to meet me, since we barely interacted. They'd love if I could come an hour early and help set up. I shook off the vague Stepford Wives vibes and I figured, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n\nSo my then-boyfriend and I showed up early. The women looked at me like I had grown a third eye. Aunt declared \"No men in the kitchen!\", he was banished to the TV room, and suddenly I was stranded with 20 people I didn't know. Most of these women are housewives, and it is a matter of pride that they do 100% of the housework and cooking. It quickly became clear that I am inept at floral arrangement and my knife work is not up to par (I know how to cook, but I really don't care if the carrots slices are uneven). One of the women told me not to worry because they will teach me to be \"bride ready\" so I can make my husband proud. Awkward.\n\nAfter the meal, the women started collecting dishes, and I mentioned to my then-boyfriend that we should both help out. But, he was again banished. So I retreated with him to the TV room and hung out with the guys. We played a board game while the women cleaned.\n\nThat was a few years ago, and since then, I stay with the guys during family holidays. I'm the only woman who does. Occasionally one of the women will hand me a stack of dirty plates, or ask for help with prep. I'll help out, but I usually pull my husband in to help, too. When he gets banished, I'll go too.\n\nWe go to family gatherings 3-4 times a year. 10 hours/year of housework will not kill me. Still, it feels really weird and archaic that the men lounge around while the women work. Also, the women kind of freak me out. They are 100% perfect housewives and can be pretty intense. Never a hair out of place. I'm a nerdy tomboy, and I'm way more comfortable with the guys.\n\nMy mom says I'm being rude. If I don't want to participate with the way they run their family functions, I should not attend.

I don’t do so much by way of socializing, maybe once or twice per month have girls time out etc.\n\nWe’re slated to move in together in the next few months, and have been doing “trials” spending a few nights at BF’s place here and there, hanging out once or twice per week etc. This is our first time spending the holidays together. Thanksgiving worked out nicely. We went to BF’s then to my family’s and then relaxed at the house. \n\nChristmas was always my favorite growing up. My family still had big gatherings when I was little, I got to see everyone, everyone was happy and it was great yadda yadda yadda. Now it’s borderline depressing. No family dinner on my side. It’s basically just me and my son and my mom usually. I was so looking forward to spending Christmas together this year and making new traditions and enjoying the holiday together. Family and togetherness is how I feel Christmas is supposed to be. Well BF too, just a little differently...\n\nBF’s Christmas tradition is to go out and get shit faced with his brothers and friends on Christmas Eve and then go to his parents for Christmas Day dinner. Obviously I said I’d be passing on the eve, that I’ll be home with DS watching Christmas movies and baking cookies and whatnot. And we’re supposed to all go to Christmas dinner.\n\nThen we had talked about New Years, which we decided we’d stay home and hang with the kiddo. I told BF I’d be spending it with DS, but he can do his own thing and at one point BF said we *have* to spend New Years together. It was non negotiable for him. Ok cool, so you’re gonna hang with us at the house and drink fake wine and play music and bang pots and pans and whatnot?\n\nWell tonight he expressed his dissatisfaction with not “going out” and asked if this is going to be every year? To which I replied maybe next year we can switch it up and he can stay home with us on Christmas Eve and I can get a sitter and we can go out together on NYE.

I am not the type to try to come between him and his “him” time/family/friends. I feel like I’m super understanding and do a lot of working around his schedule and doing what he wants etc so that comment was a real slap in the face.\n\nAnyway. He’s going to be doing his own thing all weekend this weekend and going out Christmas Eve and we’re going to his family thing with him on Christmas. And then he acts like I’m the devil for suggesting that we compromise next year? If he wants to spend NYE together *out*, is it really that ridiculous for me to ask that he spend Christmas Eve home with my kid and I?\n\nAITA?",

We contact him and let him know are date and he says no, that doesn’t work, in fact that whole month doesn’t work try December (the following month). We pick a date in December and confirm with him. Great!  Two weeks later, her mom lets us know he can’t do that date either, but can do the following week. Ok, we can do that, getting a little close to Christmas but that’s fine. Two months later we get another call from her mom, he can’t do our second date but can do ____ date in November. She says she’s already talked to the church and venue and we just have to say yes. I don’t get a chance to talk to my Fiancée without her mom on speakerphone before it is agreed that we will move to the November date. It’s moved, venue is confirmed as is the church, and we are getting quotes from vendors as I type this (no deposits yet).\n\nHere’s the twist. After moving the date my Fiancée informed me we are 1 week after my old roommates wedding. Very close friend from college with a guest list overlap of ~15 people. Roommate won’t be able to come if we do this new date, some of our out of state guests will for sure not come (as in have already told us). I feel like we’re hurting our wedding with this new date to accommodate an officiant I have never met and will probably never see again after this wedding. \n\nI talked to my Fiancée and we agreed that despite wanting her relative to perform the ceremony it was coming at too great an expense to ourselves and other guests, so we called her mom and said “let’s look at moving the date to the original planned date.” Mom is upset but says “ok I’ll talk to venues.”\n\nLater that night I get a text from my Fiancée saying her parents decided it was too important to them for him to be the officiant so we cannot move the date. They are providing a significant (read majority) contribution to the wedding and (reasonably IMO) feel they can make this call, though they did not explicitly mention it.\n\nI’m very upset by this. My close friend is guaranteed to miss my wedding and if we like we are being rude to them by bumping against their date. Additionally having somebody else tell me when my wedding is going to be 4 times without any agency is frustrating. \n\nAITA for being upset? WIBTA if I press the issue?

I also take care of the smaller things - refilling soap/sugar etc, purchasing household items. This totals somewhere between 5.5 and 7 hrs/week, sometimes more. \n\nI get frustrated because, even working from home and with chores that take less time, spouse often doesn't get their chores done, and I have to handwash items to have a utensil or plate for my meal or the recycling will build up in the collection area. Spouse in turn gets frustrated because they think that since I work less and have time in the evenings to work out or relax, I should be doing some of their chores. I feel like we both live here and as members of a household, we both have responsibilities to maintain and fulfill, and while I'm fine helping out those weeks where things are particularly busy, it shouldn't be every week.\n\nSo AITA for expecting my spouse to take care of their chores and getting frustrated when they don't?

Just like some feedback for myself. \n\nI'm a single mother with 2 kids (12F, 15M) and the older one has had some issues with video gaming and internet use which heavily affected his grades. So now I have a system where the internet is always disabled right when they get home. They leave their smartphones downstairs and they have 2 hours after school each day to finish their homework. Once they're done, I reactive the internet and they can do as they wish. \n\nI thought I was being responsible with this. Before, I'd frequently find them both surfing instagram or social media while they claimed to be working on homework. Now I know they're working because they show me the work and I can at least be satisfied that some things are being completed. My younger daughter is ok with this system although my son has argued that I'm too controlling and even \"abusive\" for limiting his internet access. He says internet is basically a right and I can't restrict and isolate him just because I don't understand. But the thing is before I implemented this system he was making constant Cs in school. He played online games all night or would just chat with his friends. Now he's actually completing schoolwork. \n\nAITA for enforcing this rule? I was surprised when I saw similar situations pop up online and people saying the mother was abusive for limiting internet. Is this really the case?",

I go through a lot of earplugs, and noise cancelling headphones have probably been one of my best purchases. But continuous noise stresses me out, and compounds on other stresses and even itself. \n\n\nI've always been like this, so my family knows, and nobody is under the age of ten. But they've never really been willing to quiet down. Any tkme I spend at home is a constant cacaphony of stomping, screaming, shouting, bickering, slamming doors, TVs turned up so loud it's a miracle nobody's got hearing damage, and it never stops. They even scream in the car, and it's a fight to get the volume on anything playing under 50. From 7 AM to past midnight, it's a constant barrage of pointless noise that makes actually spending time with family either very stressful or nearly impossible. I have approached family members asking them to please be more quiet, offering solutions and compromises, but I get told \"Well OP, the world can't change to suit your needs.\" And I get that, but I kind of wish that I could at least be met halfway at the family home where I am supposedly always welcome. Last visit, after a screaming match between my mom and my brother, I packed my things and left a day early.

She used to invite me to go out with her but since she moved in with her boyfriend recently, she's just been coming to my house and going out with him and other people, until I asked her why she didn't want to hang out so much. I thought she was spending extra time with her partner and had, you know, forgotten her other friends still exist. She said no, it was cos she didn't want to invite me to things if I might be upset that I couldn't come if I wasn't well. I explained that I was upset cos she seemed to not want to hang out as much and could she please not decide for me what I was well enough to do or not, just invite me and let me decline, as she knows my health changes day to day. \n\nAnyway. This weekend I wasn't feeling well and I asked her if we could hang out, she said yes and came to my house. I wasn't sure how far I could go out, so we went to the beach right nearby.\n\nAfter about an hour she was texting loads, then announced she was gonna go to the pub with her boyfriend and his friend - both of whom are my friends too - for st Patrick's day and she was gonna wear a green top I gave her. She said she was feeling bored on the beach.\n\nShe made no move to invite me to join them until I asked if I could come if I want to and she said yes I could come. I decided it would be too far for me to go in the end. We left so she could go join them. I felt a bit shit about not being able to go but way worse about apparently not being welcome. \n\nThen stupidly, I emailed her asking why she didn't invite me at first, and if it was cos of my health could she, again, not decide for me what I can do, and if it was cos she didn't want me to come then that's her choice. Then I felt like shit for asking her to justify her decision not to invite me cos she doesn't have to invite me or explain. \n\nBut basically my best friend said that she was bored of me and was gonna hang out with our other friends instead, after an hour on the beach, when I was expecting an afternoon with her - looked like she was bored of me not just the beach. And I felt she was only there to help, not cos she wanted to see me - it's hard to be great company when you're not very well but I'm hardly a charity case.\n\nShe didn't reply to my question (I immediately wrote again to say sorry for asking and she doesn't have to answer). I think I've either lost a friend cos she doesn't like me anymore, or I've lost a friend cos I'm being stupid about whether she likes me or not.\n\nIs she the asshole for excluding me from our mutual friends?

            "input": "Hi, guys! I find myself in a pretty shitty situation and I'm not entirely sure if I am being an asshole or not. Here's the situation I find myself in.\n\nFirst a little backstory...\n\nI met my ex-boyfriend at my then thirteen year old sister's summer soccer league tournament (she turned fourteen in November). He was a few months from turning eighteen and was becoming a high school senior. I was just starting high school toward the end of August and had just turned fifteen a couple of weeks before. His game ended an hour before I met him and my sister's team took the field. He came over and introduced himself. He said about his sister playing on the same team as my sister and we struck up a friendship right there while watching our younger siblings play. We ended up seeing each other on a regular basis after that. We started the school year in August and we really didn't see bunches of each other besides at lunch when we'd sit at a table together but we'd get together after our respective practices (his being soccer and me for cheerleading and softball on the weekend).\n\nWe kept this up for the next four months where we'd do stuff together and be boyfriend/girlfriend. Eventually I'd lose my virginity to him thinking he was such a great guy. Granted we would fight...but it was nothing too serious and any issues we did have would be resolved pretty quickly.\n\nThat would change around Christmastime...\n\nA few days before Christmas break, we were sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch when he said to me about having to go to another city in our state to visit family for Christmas. I told him that it was fine and that we were having family over from out of state and out of the country (Japan) for Christmas. We agreed to do our gift exchange on Friday night and I'd sleepover at his place. We did the exchange Saturday morning before they left to head north. I got him the game Pro Evolution Soccer for his PS4 because he had said about wanting to play that since he's played so much FIFA and he wanted to try PES. He got me a couple of cheaper necklaces and a bunch of cheaper bracelets and anklets (some of which I wear on a pretty regular basis) which I thought was so cute. I left his place about an hour and a half before they were supposed to leave. We texted when he got to where he was going later in the day and we texted and talked on other social media clear up to Christmas evening. The 26th we didn't get to talk because we were busy with other family and I was busy talking with my cousins that I never met before from Japan. The girls and I were up until 3 in the morning talking and drinking 7up and sparkling grape juice in the spa. The morning of the 27th, I didn't wake up until 10 in the morning which is late for me. My texts had blown up asking me if I had seen what was going on, on facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. I didn't know what they were talking about. So I looked at my socials...and my now ex broke up with me over social media. Not only did he break up with me...he blocked me on all the social medias I had him friended on. I texted him and he told me that he didn't want to hook up with me anymore and wanted to hook up with a new sophomore cheerleader on the varsity squad. I was devestated. I cried and was sad for several days. I finally started feeling better around New Year's Eve and even went for a shopping spree with my cousins and sisters and I even got dreadlocks! January 2nd rolled around and we had to go back to school. I was glad to see my friends from school and just wanted to get back into the swing of school. My ex tried to talk to me several times but I kept ignoring him on the advice of some of my closest friends and my eldest sister. Finally, Friday, he decided to confront me asking me what my fucking problem was and why I was being such a bitch and not talking to him. I told him that I didn't want to be associated with someone who only decides to break up with someone over the internet instead of doing it face-to-face. He called me a bitch and an asshole. I continued to not talk to him for the rest of the day.\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to him after how he broke up with me?",

This is about a video game so it’s no big deal or anything, just something that’s bugging me a little. \n\nSo this morning I had some extra time before my classes started, and since I usually spend my evenings reading I decided to start up Overwatch and play a competitive game of three. For anyone who doesn’t know, Overwatch is a FPS multiplayer, and the competitive mode in Overwatch involves two teams of six either pushing a payload or getting control of a certain point in the map.  If someone leaves the competitive mode of this game, no new players are allowed in so you’re left facing a team of six with five players. You get penalized if you leave a competitive match, you lose 50 points and you’re not allowed to play in that mode for 10 minutes. \n\nDuring my the second game, everything was going fine until one of the members of my team left the game. My team tried but there was just no winning, so everyone except for me left. I wasn’t sure of the extent of the punishment I would receive for leaving a competitive match, and since there was only about 4 minutes left I figured I would just stick around and lose this game so that I could play again immediately after the game. No malicious intent on my part at all. \n\nAt first the other team was sympathetic, but then two or three of them started complaining that I was punishing them by wasting their time because I was salty for my loss. I wanted to explain that this wasn’t the case, but then I figured that no matter what I say they will believe what they want, and there was only a minute left anyway. The messages got rather nasty and I was accused (among other things) of being a bad person and I’m pretty sure they reported my account. I didn’t get mean in my responses to them, just said it wasn’t my fault my team left either and that they were getting a free win, not how you’d want to play a game but not bad for them either. \n\nMy reasoning was that they just needed to wait for a little while and get a free win, and we could all be on our merry way, but after thinking about it I’m feeling guilty. Maybe I should have just left and copped the admittedly mild punishment, and not wasted anyone else’s time. \n\nSo I want to ask the benevolent members of reddit, was I an asshole for not leaving the game?

We used to see each other at least every two weeks, but we have the kind of friendship where we could not see each other for months and still be best friends when we meet. \n\nA month and a half ago, he was in the middle of his exams, while I had finished mine (we go to the same university), so, naturally, I wanted to relax for a few days, use my days off from work to get some rest and visit my family. However, he asked me to help him study for his remaining exams and, reluctantly, I said I'd help him. I know I should have refused if I really didn't want to, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him no, so I spent my free time studying together with him for his exams. This went on for three days, admittedly not a long period of time, and he knew I had put aside my plans in order to help him.\n\nAaand that's the last time I've seen my friend. Ever since, I've initiated conversations with him, hoping that we'd hang out, but he was always dismissive or not answering my texts. In this time, he went out only with his girlfriend and her friends, never with our group of friends. Now, don't get me wrong, he has always spent more time with his girlfriend than us and that never bothered me, I would never intrude on his relationship. Plus, me and his girlfriend get on really well, so I'm not being petty.\n\nRecently, he has been trying to reconnect and this time I didn't feel like hanging out with him anymore because I still feel that I was discarded when no longer needed, so I was dismissive when texting him. He just sent me a message asking me if I'm upset with him and I thought I should ask your opinions before answering.\n\nP.S. I know I said I'd only talk about the situation with my best friend, but now I think I should mention my other friend for a better understanding of my almost pathological inability to say no. The other friend is my roommate, he is one year younger than me and goes to the same university as I, and he always asks me for help on exams and homework. He always showed gratitude for that, so that's not the issue. My problem is that, during the summer vacation, three months long, he always came up with an excuse to not hang out. I brought it up to him last night and he seemed to realize I was right, but was dismissive of the conversation and just kept saying I wasn't right, thinking I was joking even though I insisted I was serious. This just made me more upset.\n\nSorry for the long text, thanks for reading!",

As a young man of 19 years of age, having my cousin offer to be a doner was huge for me however things haven't quite worked out that well.\n\nFor context, my cousin is is a few years older than me, she's long since been the 'golden child' due to her being the oldest and only girl of 4 grandchildren.  At family meals her and her mother would hog the attention of my nan and grandad much to my dad's annoyance leading to a few small spats here and there but an otherwise happy family unit.\n\nThe problems arose with her several months into her vetting process to get her ready to be a doner. On this specific day she had text me roughly 9AM asking for some contact details for a nurse at the hospital. Admittedly, I checked the message, clearly showing her I had read it but did not answer right away. I had some dialysis supplies being delivered and they would take a significant amount of time to organise.\n\nAs fate would have it, that day I had been accidentally booked in for an appointment at a specialist hospital a roughly 1.5 hour drive away. The hospital transport arrived and I had no choice but to go with them and have this appointment. I had no mobile data on my phone and could not contact my cousin whilst I was on my way to the hospital.\n\nI arrived at the hospital and waited in the transport vehicle whilst the driver went to figure out the specifics of the appointment. The hospital I was at had a free wifi connection and so I connected to it to inform my immediate family of where I was as I had been home alone at the time. Almost immediately I saw that I had a message from my cousin and it was honestly one of the most repulsive messages I had ever read. It oozed sarcasm, was overtly condescending and proceeded to remind me of how much she had done for me whilst still having the gall to end with \"I love you (OP name) but I don't love what you're doing right now\".\n\nAll from leaving her on read for under 2 hours.\n\nAt the time, I saw huge flashing danger signs in my head. This woman was supposed to be giving me a kidney, how could I trust that she wouldn't hold that over me for the next 20 or so years a kidney transplant can last? I left that comment on read too whilst I formulated a response. Me, my girlfriend and my dad all chipped in that evening to write an admittedly condescending message that boiled down to \"Stop being childish and I can't have you donate a kidney to me in good faith\".\n\nSince then, she hasn't said a word to me or my family. Her family as well as my nan and grandad blocked all of my family and other than some less than friendly emails between my Dad and Nan there has been almost no contact. Neither side has shown  interest in trying to resolve the issue, this was well over 8 months ago.\n\nSo, AITA Reddit? I won't lie, I feel an immense amount of guilt. Whilst he won't admit it, I fear that my dad misses his mum and dad. They were a big part of his life and I can't help but feel responsible. I could also be living a somewhat normal life by now if I had just taken the message on the chin and not valued my pride so much. The stress I've put on my family with my declining health could have all been avoided. Apologies for the long post but this has been good to get off my chest. Thanks for reading \n\nTl;dr: Potential kidney doner gets annoyed after being left on read. She is removed by me from my potential doner list for being immature and this causes a rift in the family.\n\nP.S: That appointment? The one I spend nearly 3 hours both ways in a hot transport vehicle to go to? It never existed. It was supposed to be the week after but the transport company messed up. 😑😑😑\n\n\n\n\nStay",

Problem is my sleeping schedule is far from consistent, and he didn't do the best at following those rules either, so it didn't work.\n\nI started knocking at the wall and shouting but since he has headphones on he has a harder time hearing me.

One night it was BEFORE MY SAT's FOR GODS SAKE and he wouldn't stop so I pounded on the wall many times until he did. Later brought it up with my mom and for a while things improved.\n\nNow my bed is moved to a different wall and I still hear him crystal clear.

Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\n\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\n\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \"I'm just joking!\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \"my way\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \n\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \n\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \"there might be some around\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \n\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \"these monitors don't work\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\n\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\n\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \"this is how things work here now\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\n\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\n\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\n\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \"programming\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\n\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \n\n\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\"\n\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \"But *I* wanted a monitor!\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\n\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\n\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\"\n\nMy brother responds with \"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\". \n\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\". \n\n\"Oh, I didn't know that\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \"these monitors don't work\".\n\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\n\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\n\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\n\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?",

I share my apartment with a friend from high school ( each with out own room), but he’s chill with the situation and gets along with her too. There have been no problems with the situation so far, but she does have her own apartment which she doesn’t really use. \n\nRecently we both came back home for spring break, but she went back earlier than I did. I let her keep the keys to my place so that she could sleep there and cook and well chill, I get in 2 days after her with my roommate. This has happened before where I let her live at my place for a bit without me and it wasn’t an issue. Last time she also wanted to have a friend over and had asked me with a good amount of time letting me know. I wasn’t super happy about it, but it was about a week without me and she said she got lonely so I complied. And I would just prefer she used her place to hang out with her friends which is like 3 blocks away. \n\nThe issue came this time when because from what I can tell she was at my place and asked her friend to move her stuff to her apartment to make extra space in the closet for her summer stuff ( we share my closet she was moving out winter stuff for summer stuff). In the moment I wasn’t made aware of that, and I assumed she was alone. She left the apartment to pick up some things and came back saying things with “we” and I was confused thinking she was alone. So I asked and she said she was with her friend. Then I asked if she and her friend were going to chill at my apartment and she then said yea if it was ok with me. I then told her that I thought it was a bit weird for people to be at my place, but since her friend was already there then they might as well. They hadn’t moved her clothes or anything just gone to pick other stuff up from nearby. \n\nMy girlfriend was upset by this saying that she mentioned her friend helping her, but she hadn’t mentioned when or that they were even together. I was more upset that she was inviting people, and I was the one that asked if they were hanging out at my place before she even mentioned it. She ended up sending her friend home and getting really upset saying that she wants to move out because I don’t make it feel like her home too. In reality I know it’s not a big deal if her friend had stayed to chill but I would have liked a bit more of a heads up than me asking if she’s alone when in reality her and the friend are already driving to my place. \n\nSo AITA for getting upset ",

But now I really love my baby, she's very small and I feel like i owe my life to her. I enjoy sleeping besides her, feeding her and carrying her. I work full time (since i dropped out of college) so I stopped playing xbox and soccer and that was WAY before my daughter was born and during the time Nat was pregnant. I'm not the world's greatest dad, but I do my best to help Nat out as much as possible, I clean Amy's bottles, prepare her things for bath time and to other things like the dishes and laundry. Throughout the day, when I feel that I'm finished with my daily chores and when Amy is sleeping and once Nat is relaxing I'll try to workout because my inactivity has made me gain weight and now I'm not even the shadow of the fit player I used to be. And on my days off at night I'll try to crack some skulls online. However, lately Nat has been saying I play too much and that I prefer playing xbox over Amy. When you play online, you can't simply pause and yet, I'll drop anything I'm doing to carry Amy. She also says I'm selfish for working out and that I should do that when Amy's older. She even told my mom (40) about it and she agreed so now both of them have made me feel bad. There's a soccer tournament next month at my office and I've thought about dropping out since I haven't played in a  long time and apparently can't train nor work out.

This is mainly due to the fact that all my friends have gone back to university due to classes starting on the 7th on January. Because I am on a co-op term, I have to stay in my home city which is hours away from my university. Basically, I'll have no friends to hang out with this year. \n\nBut y'see, I joined this nifty online Discord community so I thought that I would still be able to spend time with some close online friends. Unfortunately for me, many of them are also busy with school and exams and whatnot. However, one of my closer friends, let's refer to her as Sam, doesnt study a lot and spends most of her time playing League of Legends, which I also play with her often. So my birthday hits, I finish work and get home at 7pm where I expect to find Sam online. I see her playing some League of Legends as expected and I ask if she wants to play with me after I finish dinner. She agrees so I promptly head out to dinner so I can finish quicker and have time to play with her. Note: I sleep at 10:30pm due to an early work schedule and Sam is aware of this fact.\n\nSo I finish my birthday dinner and am heading back at around 8pm. I message her to reconfirm that she's available to play with me once I get home. She confirms this fact and I head home. So I get home at around 8:20 and I give Sam a call. She doesn't pick up so I wait in the empty call by myself for a couple minutes before me messages me saying that she will be home in a bit. I'm a bit taken aback by this because I wasn't even aware that she had gone out. So I just so \"ok\" and go watch some youtube for a bit. So fast forward half an hour and Sam has not messaged me since. I ask her what's up and she says she's still not home yet. At around 9pm, she finally msgs me to tell me she's home so I give her a call and get prepared to spend the rest of the day playing some League of Legends with Sam. Before she picks up she messages me \"if ur too tired you can sleep and we can play another time\". I'm completely dumbstruck by that statement and I got the impression that she lowkey didnt want to play so I quickly hang up the call. She notices that and tries to recover by saying \"Oh unless you want to play today\" but I'm not having any of it. Her lack of apologies for being late, lack of notice for her absence, and implying I sleep off my birthday pissed me off. I log off discord and am in such a bad state that I go to get some alcohol. It seems a bit pathetic but I was lonely and bored so I didn't really care at that point that I was drinking alone. Sam calls my phone a couple times and I ignore them and continue drinking because at that point we would only be able to squeeze 2 or 3 games in and in the mood I was in they wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I spent the rest of the day drinking my sorrows away.\n\nI wake up today and log back in on discord and I get a message from Sam saying \"let's play league today!\". I tell her I wanted to play league yesterday but she replies saying that it was my fault we didn't play League because I ignored her calls and whatnot. We argue for a bit with her saying I misunderstood her message and me just getting pissed at her for what she did yesterday. She puts the blame on me and gives a sarcastic apology for her actions such as \"sorry I cant teleport home\". AITA for jumping to conclusions quickly and having too high expectations?",

Also   \n\nI’ll start off by saying my buddy is B and my ex is E\n\nSo B and I have been friends since high school, We’re both 25.  B left for BC after graduation and didn’t see him until 4 years later when he moved back to his moms. We caught up and eventually started hanging out and becoming more like brothers.  \n\nNow he lives in a town about 100km from where I live,  and despite the distance for years i would drive up on a Friday night after work and hang out with him until Sunday evening.  At times when my other buddies would go out i would drive more than halfway to pick him up and bring him along.  He doesn’t drive so as for meeting up I’m the one doing all the driving.   \n\n\nNow when he moved to his moms,  he met a couple girls at his job and one weekend I was up we hung out with both of them.  One of them being E.   He became pretty good friends with both of em, but after the past couple years he’s really only kept in contact with E from time to time.  They would hang out sometimes but it became more frequent when i got involved. \n\nNow we’re at this past October.  Up at his place one morning I had matched with E on a dating app and she reached out to me,  from there on we started talking, more and more each day until we decided to become a couple.  B knows full well I’m talking to her, and during all this B ended up breaking things off with his then GF,  to which I withstood crap from E because I wanted to be there for B and help him out through what was a trying time for him instead of seeing her (During all this I would only see her on weekends as she lived in the same town as B). For 7 weeks in a row i drove to and from B’s place on the weekends to see both B &amp; E.  E however explained to me that B, when it was just them two one evening, confided in E that he had feelings for her.  This was while we were still dating mind you,  and she told me that she didn’t feel the same way.  \n\nHere’s where I royally fuck up though,  because I had a fling who also lived in that same town and one Saturday, both B &amp; E were working and against my better judgement we arranged plans to meet up.  At the time I guess i wanted to see her, but when I was driving to her place I couldn’t shake that feeling of guilt and backed out.  I know that it’s a real shitty thing to do, especially because I had it done to me once before.  So later that night she was going through my phone, unbeknownst to me and came across the convo with my old fling.  Of course she was upset with me, and as I’ve been honest so far,  I never felt like more of a piece of shit.  I really do have feelings for her and I answered every question she asked regarding my old fling.  We came to the agreement that we were still going to try and make it work.  I took all the shit she gave me and then some.  I even drove up after work on a Tuesday to see her to at least show her that I’m trying my best to make things better.  But sometimes your best isn’t enough.   \n\n3 weeks after my fuck up,  i was talking with her on the phone on a Sunday evening and she tells me that she can’t stop thinking about me and that fling.  So we agreed to “start over”.  Her words not mine.  \n\nDuring that following week,  i could tell she was just losing more interest everyday, and (i dont do it anymore) I saw on Snapchat that she was at B’s place pretty muc everyday that week.   On the Friday I’m driving home,  call her and chat for a little bit. I could tell something was up.  And after our call,  she then proceeds to ask me if I remember that night we talked about B and how he told her he liked her.  Then says that she doesn’t just like him “she’s in love with that idiot”.  Idk but i just sorta lost it.  I had to pull over because my head was spinning and I just wanted to scream.  I was under the impression we were “starting over” and not actually ending things. \n\nEverything I’ve done the past several years B has been involved.  We were inseparable, and I don’t have anyone else who I’m as close with like i am with him.  \n\nBasically that whole weekend and next week B doesn’t say boo to me.  In fact he acts like everything is ok.  I had to bring it up and he just asks “oh what’s wrong buddy? Is it E &amp; I? Does that bother you?”\n\nI lost it on him because yes it bothers me and how in the flying fuck do you think that it wouldnt.  I’m the kind of guy that wears my heart on my sleeve and he more than anyone knows that.  Or at least I thought.  Within a week when she told me about B they were already posting pics on social media and the like.  It really hurt my feelings,  not because she just up and leaves but because my buddy didn’t have a single shred of doubt that what he was doing was wrong,  or that I would be perfectly fine with them dating.  \n\nI can’t think of either of them without the other and it’s been constantly bothering me.  I told him that I don’t think I can come up to see him like i used to, and that i just need to time to sorta work this shit out.  He doesn’t seem to mind because he still is with her pretty much everyday now and he doesn’t reach out to me at all. \n\nI apologize for the block of text,  but i just need a third party’s’ opinion on this because I want to see B again, and hang out with him and his family,  because I’m like another son to them,  but I’m angry that he’d done something like that to me.   I wish he would have at least talked to me about it before,  it seems that they’d always had these feeings for each other but decided to act on it right after I date her.  Again,  I’m not wanting to downplay what i did,  i know it was wrong and I took a long look at myself and knew that’s who I didn’t want to be. But i also dont want to just pretend everything is ok between B &amp; I because this just hits me right in the heart.  B would be the the guy i go to whenever I had issues with a girl and now he’s become directly involved.  I still havent seen either of them and this was the week before Christmas this happened.  \n\nSo AITA for possibly not talking to B or hanging out with him again? Should I just try to come to terms with it and move on? I don’t know what to do\n",

Of course I disagreed with this - by that time, I plan to have a career and possibly a family in this foreign country, and she can’t expect me to just drop everything and become some stay at home nanny for her. At least, that’s what I think. \nShe was appalled, accused me of not caring about her or my father, and stormed off. \n\nOf course, I would definitely come back to England to visit them whenever I could if they were ill - hell, I want to visit them and vice versa as much as I can every year regardless of their health. \n\nI just think that if they were to get ill, it is both unfair and irresponsible to expect me to drop my life in order to become their full time caregiver. I am not and will not be trained for that, and I wholeheartedly believe they would be better off in an old person’s home should they need to be in one. \n\nI love them both and care for them greatly so it sucks that my mother thinks I don’t. \n\nWIBTA if I stuck to this viewpoint?

We’re trying to be responsible and have all of The Conversations you’re supposed to before you get married.

He agreed that made sense so he wouldn’t but asked if I was keeping a separate account to keep paying for my student loans. I was shocked and a little hurt, to say the least. \n\nHe comes from an upper/upper middle class family who sent him to private school K-12 and paid for his college entirely. My parents are public school teachers so obviously they couldn’t do that for me, but I had a large part of undergrad covered with scholarships. I have two BAs and will finish grad school soon with a total debt of about $50k. Not great, but I know that’s still at or below average for our generation. \n\nHe said he’s uncomfortable paying for debt he didn’t accumulate and doesn’t want that “affecting credit scores and stuff.” (It’s worth noting his parents are pretty secretive about money, so his financial education is... lacking.) I can understand that in general, and it would be a different conversation if he’d had his own debt that he paid off solo. I also explained that I’m not expecting him to write a check from his own salary while I go blow my own pay on dumb stuff. I feel like I’m being held at arm’s length or looked down on because of a completely normal, if shitty, part of life that he was just lucky enough to avoid. \n\nAITA for looking at marriage this way - a total combination of everything, including all the baggage in all its forms?

A and i got in a big fight starting when i was drunk and mentioned i was thinking about killing myself. he contacted P asking for my mom's info to let my mom know what was happening, and instead of being mad at A i was mad at P for giving away my information.

A is known for using hard drugs. my boyfriend threatened to turn him into the police (even after i said not to) due to this because of all the times he has upset me. when i mentioned that i was trying to stop him to do that A got mad at me because i wasn't trying \"hard enough\" to protect him. long story short, i was told i'm a manipulative snake who cares about no one but myself for deciding to no longer be friends with A (i sent him a message telling him we should break off the friendship, to which he responded saying how i'm manipulative)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm honestly really confused with this situation and how i'm being called the manipulative asshole and a snake.

Minimal arguments and the ones we had were solved in mature ways, healthy time spent together and not trying to get in the way of each other’s friendships, understanding that time had to be spent with other people, great memories made etc.\n\nAfter we got to college the distance really affected us. We’re both collegiate athletes, and with sports, classes, social lives, and time zone differences, it became really hard to get the time to talk that we wanted. We lost a fair bit of communication, and it really did take a toll on the relationship. \n\nEventually she started doing things that I thought were counterproductive to her being successful (I know, this sounds like something an asshole would say, but we both took our schooling and athletics seriously and liked to keep each other accountable). She would stay out super late partying on the nights she had big tests, she picked up cigarettes, and she started having guys that she would let crash in her dorm after nights of drinking. This made me uncomfortable and I did get angry but we were able to talk through it. Even though I wasn’t happy about it I trusted her.\n\nOne night, after the distance had really brought us to a breaking point, I called her and she was out partying the night of a midterm. I said she didn’t seem like the person I knew and she just said “I guess I’ve changed.” I ended it right there. About a week later, one of my good friends, who attends the same school as her, had told me she was already sleeping with other guys. A month later she started dating another guy and was making posts talking about how much she loved him and things like that.\n\nA year and half went by and out of nowhere I get a text from her asking if I wanted to talk about things. She said she didn’t like the way it ended and was scared she’d have a panic attack if we saw each other in person during any of our school breaks (our hometown isn’t small but we have a lot of mutual friends and we frequent the same places).\n\nI wasn’t too keen on the idea. I didn’t have any hard feelings about the breakup itself, I knew it had to happen, but the way she moved on and how fast she had done it, coupled with the person she had become, had made me a little bitter towards her. I told her that there had been plenty of opportunities for us to bump into each other and it had never been a problem before so why was she worried about it now? I then called her out for how quickly she moved on and how shitty of a person she had just seemed to become.\n\nI never contacted her again and she hasn’t tried to contact me yet, but I get this feeling that I should have tried to be a better person and meet with her to talk about it. AITA for not doing that?\n\ntl;dr Broke up with girlfriend of two years after we couldn’t handle long distance and she changed from the person I used to know.

            "input": "Some background. We have a small female, un neutered (or however you say it) cockapoo who is great. Shes calm, good with people, and obedient for the most part. We've had her for about six years now. When we originally got her, it was my mother's idea. The dog, let's call her Megatron, was extremely disobedient the first year. Constant shitting in the house, ate our food, harassed our cat of 10 years. My mother talked all the time about how pointless and hopeless this dog was, how she would give it away the next month if things didnt change. It was just a puppy doing puppy things. She didn't seem to understand that training dogs takes a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur other, much more well behaved dog, beloved by my mother as almost another child, died about three years ago. She was understandably heartbroken as we all were. A great dog. He was about medium sized, so she not soon after started looking for another medium sized dog. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to two years ago and she went to the local pet store for some dog food for Megatron. She comes back with this large puppy, about the size of a medium sized dog. Completely rash decision. I am not aware of the hurricane that is to come so am initially excited and supportive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMegatron is not spayed/neutered, keep in mind, so she is extremely territorial of this new dog. She immediately does not jive with it and it sucks. He wants to play, Megatron wants to fight. The house is constantly a canine battlefield. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe puppy is extremely difficult, added challenge of him already being the size of a medium sized dog. He breaks out of his cart, tears up carpet, eats food from the kitchen, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and stepdad are leaving for somewhere, so they ask me to watch the house while they're gone and make sure that the puppy and Megatron get along. Two problems: \n\n1. I have a historic phobia of dogs, and dog conflict makes me very anxious. She was around to witness this development in my early years \n\n2. I am an extremely anxious person. I have at this point already made clear to her that I was going through a period of immense mental difficulty, as I developed a severe panic disorder out of no where. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo absolutely no ones surprise, shit hit the fan. The puppy immediately began causing problems. Chewing things up, getting aggressive with Megatron, scaring the cat. I called my girlfriend over to help calm me down. I was playing computer games in the living room to distract me. Dog ate my only mouse. My girlfriend leaves to get me a new mouse because shes amazing and I was worried about not having one that night as using my laptop is part of my relaxation routine. When she comes back, dog eats her new vans she just bought. When she tries to get them back, dog bites her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire time I'm having an extreme panic attack, Megatron is very uncomfortable, cat is hiding, my girlfriends pissed. My mom never took responsibility for anything that the puppy destroyed. She never got me a new mouse, my sister new shoes. When I told her about it, her response was \"That's what happens when you get a puppy\". I firmly believe that it isnt what happens because it's not my puppy, it was hers. She knew the difficulty of this dog, she knew my anxiety would skyrocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is, the puppy was too much for her too. She put it up for adoption in a shelter, again. Poor dog now has to wait twice for it's owner, because my mom didn't have the responsibility for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow shes telling me, tonight, she has her eyes on this new female puppy, three weeks old. I start off like I don't believe shes serious, but my younger sister of course feeds into this mess, because she of course never had to take care of the previous dog, or will this new one likely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell her \"I'm not babysitting this one\" which she responds \"I never asked you to\". I said \"You did the last puppy and that went horribly\" and she says \"Well you live here, you might have to.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of bunked if you ask me. I am a college student with a job that only gets me 16 hours a week avg. I like the hours because I'm still very much contending with my anxiety problem. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't been easy to work around. I'm making some progress in some areas, but I'm also experiencing new psychotic symptoms lately such as slight hallucinations and paranoia. Shes never been good at supporting my anxiety, so I've gone this journey alone save my father and girlfriend. Therapy has been expensive and hard to find. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's necessary to mention that because I'd be much more willing to help with the dog if I hadn't already so much reason to worry. It's her house which I am lucky enough to live in rent free, so long as I stay in school. It's her life, she can get a puppy if she wants. I won't even try to stop her, that's just not right of me. But I feel like I have the right to refuse to help take care of it, and express my general concern as to why its a horrible idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom historically bad with puppies. First puppy we barely kept and is now a great, small dog. Mom expected me to participate for this second, large puppy which went to shit, destroyed me and my girlfriends things, set off my anxiety disorder to all hell, and she refused to take responsibility for it. Got put up for adoption. Now she wants another new puppy which we all know will not jive with our first dog, and she also expects me to take responsibility for it. ",

I moved out, into my friends unoccupied house, then into my own flat. After realising that I can't do everything, I couldn't pay for myself, for my employee, for all her rent, food, bills and all my sons needs, I asked her to come back and work with me.

Anyways, through some very poorly and not concrete texts we had decided that I would stay out in their motor home as they had no room inside and that my girlfriend could sleep with her little sister. \n\nSo everything was good until it was about time to go to bed. Now I had been dealing with an ulcer which gave me incredible heartburn and I would constantly wake up at night in incredible pain and have to take xantax to calm the pain. Since I was staying outside and I knew they would most likely lock the doors I asked my gf to ask her dad if there was a way I would be able to get inside, for instance the door code, if I needed to use the bathroom or take my medicine. To which he responded that he \"didn't know the password and to ask her (step) mom.\" Now this was weird because how could the guy that could look at the camera for the doorbell not know the password?\n\nAnyways, we didn't think too much about it, and decided to go get me settled in the motorhome and watch Netflix. We also texted her mom and asked her the same thing to which she responded that she didn't know and to ask her dad. Now this was confusing, and honestly I was getting pretty upset. \n\nNow to preface this, we had tried to come to house early where we were locked out and her sister(18) was able to come home and unlock the door with the password. We asked if we could know the password and she said no because it was her password.\n\nSo fast forward, we ended falling asleep, and I woke up at 4 with terrible heartburn and was unable to get inside so we both just stayed out in the motorhome. Cue the morning, where we received texts from her stepmother on how disappointed she was in my gf and wouldn't accept any apology.\n\nSo not only, was I tired and sick but now I was angry because we had been lied to and then treated like children. So I, in my infinite wisdom, decided I was going to let her mother know of my disdain. I was riled up. When we went to door I shook the handle and then knocked. When her sister answered she said you couldve just knocked or rang the door bell. I said something disenchanted.

One of my close friends on said website saw that I play a game that he also plays (terraria).  He contacted me and thought it would be fun if we play together. \n\nI am a big fan of this game, and he was a little bit new. I was teaching him some good tricks and was really having some fun, but I felt uninvolved when it came to actually doing stuff together in this game because he was actively avoiding wanting to do other stuff (such as bosses) with me.\n\nWe were doing one of the harder bosses. I was preparing for this fight beforehand and I admit I rushed it. I didn’t give him any idea of what to do in the fight. I just gave him some potions and expected him to roll with it. He dies immediately, and I finished the boss. He got passive aggressive and told me to log off, and that he would do the boss again by himself. I apologized and left. \n\nA few days later, he invited me to play again. I got on and was really excited to continue from where we left off, but he went through the next 25% of the game and expected me to be prepared for the next fight. I was sad and mad, but I didn’t let that be known. I asked if he had anything to help me catch up and that he didn’t. I was sad because I missed out on a big portion of the game when I was expecting to spend that portion with him. He told me to get some items from other characters and I got some at like 1% higher than what he was currently at.\n\nHe starts the boss, and after we finished it he sees a weapon I used to do well in the fight and calls me a cheater because the weapon I got was one boss higher than the boss we were fighting, but it was still at the same level we were at. He gets mad at me and says he’ll fight the boss again by himself. I got mad and said “I’m not the only one who can do shit by them self” and “You might as well do the entire fucking game without me” because of what happened earlier. I haven’t contacted him since.\n\nI realize that it’s bad to get mad over a game, but I felt more mad at his actions rather than anything else. I really want to apologize because I realize that being petty is never the answer, but I want you guys’s opinion.\n\n",

All names have been changed.\n\nWe get to church, we're all hanging out and laughing and having a good time, and B and Todd walk away to go talk, alone.\n\n(For context, B had told me earlier that she needed to talk to Todd about something personal, and I was like okay? you do you boo. Harpago was less supportive and wanted her to talk to him about it instead, but every time she'd brought it up to him previously, he'd gotten angry and impossible to reason with.)\n\nI did not see Todd and B walk away from our group. Seeing as both the guy I have a massive crush on and my very sick best friend have disappeared, I, understandably, panic.\n\nSaid panic gets worse when another guy we know, S, walks over and whispers something to Oliver, who immediately gets angry with him and tells him to stop trying to start rumors. I, already being wound up from Todd and B's disappearance, freak out even more and ask Oliver to tell me what S said to him.\n\nOliver explains angrily that S was trying to start a rumor that Todd and B were 'spooning' on the metal stairs outside and that they'd gotten caught and yelled at by a leader. I then start shaking and put my head in my hands, because B has had issues with one male leader in particular because she's dating Harpago, a known troublemaker. Now, I know that Todd and B would never do anything bad, but I do know that Todd is parked in the back lot by the metal stairs and that they might've gone to a Walmart up the street, which is something we do often.\n\nI try to call B. No answer.\n\nI send a text in my group chat with Todd and B. No answer.\n\nI call Todd. Rings once, goes to voicemail.\n\nI call B again. No answer.\n\nI'm now on the verge of a panic attack- this is my closest friend and she's in pain, both mental and physical, and now she's missing, and so is the guy I like (who I am also close friends with). Oliver, Calvin, and Lily are all telling me that I'm overreacting and that everything is fine, but I can't calm down.\n\nLater, Todd and B reappear, coming in through the doors that lead to the lobby area. I yeet over there and ask B if I can hug her (there's a story there), she says yes, I pull her into a bone-crushing hug and when I let go I give her a stern talking-to, choked up and with tears in my eyes. Todd explains that they've been in the lobby, and everybody goes back to hanging out as normal.\n\nLater that night, I get a series of four texts from Harpago. He's berating me, telling me that B doesn't have to report her every move to me and that I need to 'stop being an asshole to her all the time' and that I'm 'not him when I  am not there'. I'm thinking to myself, dude, that's really controlling, but because I was not doing well mentally, I just apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nAITA?",

This caused a few bumps in the road.as you can probably tell, I have a lot of problems of my own. \n\nhe started texting me whenever he would have a problem. usually, I'm fine with occasional rants, but he would discuss topics such as serious mental health problems; all the time. and as someone whos trying to get better, its really hard to be around that subject. It got to the point where he would have a problem everyday and he'd spam me about it while I was out and about. one specific time that I remember is when I went to LA with my dad. We don't go out all that often and so I was really looking forward to it however, my friend kept texting me about his problems while I was out, and he was expecting me to answer and be his therapist for a couple of minutes.\n\nI would often suggest he get professional help. He'd say he would use the resources I provided him but then he would come to me about two days later with issues again. At some point, I kind of just stopped replying all that much. this started the posts and spam messages. he would constantly send out posts about being so depressed, anxious, how he was good for nothing, etc. then when I wouldn't answer, he'd text me stuff like:\n\n\"hey, it's been awhile, are you okay?\" note: I wouldn't be gone for long; about two days or maybe 6. I can't remember an instance where he left me alone for entire week this past year. He would then follow up with those messages with extremely passive aggressive things, \"how hard is it to get a text back\", \"text me as soon as possible.\"\n\nNow, going back to how he mentioned he liked me in a romantic way. I followed one of his spam accounts and when I did, I realized he had posts about me. Lots of them. like, 4-6 posts with a caption consisting about 5 paragraphs about me. This just made me feel even worse, on top of the guilt trips he'd already make me endure. He obviously knew I followed that account, as he had to accept my follow request. At this point, I started feeling super queasy and paranoid. He was just so obsessive, manipulative and all around a bad presence now.\n\nI finally had enough. After hoping that my absence would make him look for some other stimulation, or make him realize that the friendship had run its course, I told him that I don't want to continue the friendship anymore. I told him I'm glad a few things are getting better and that I hope we could still be cordial towards one another. He didn't respond.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

I need to do some more explaining for this, we're all part of a group of 9 or so friends who poke fun at each others, and others flaws, none of us take it seriously, it's just teasing, but, we always make sure we have the friend hear what we say, as we don't like to talk shit behind backs. Lots of times, there is some friendly roughhousing involved like piling on top of each other, or tackling one another, etc.. We each try not to cause harm, and if we do, it's purely accidental, as when we go too far, we make sure to ask if they're okay, or if they know it's just a joke. we apologise to each other if we know we went far. As I was saying, I say Terry has no neck, Terry started Hitting Kent's backpack with a stick as a joke Kent told Terry I said it, and started hitting my backpack as a joke, and hit my upper leg with the stick lightly. My mom picks me up at this spot, Terry and I laugh it out, but my mom See's this. as I get in the car with Terry (as he needed a ride) my mom tells Terry, \"Don't do what you don't want other's to do to you\" in Spanish. Terry does not understand Spanish, but Kent most likely does. As I walked into the car, Tyler Tells me what is going on. as a teen, I don't like other's standing up for me, I'm 14, not 5, we know the boundaries. I tell my mom, it was a joke, hoping for her to understand. Instead she and I have an argument where I try to explain my side. This goes on with how you expect it to, my mom argues that I can't let myself Be taken \"bullied\" of like that, while I tell her it was a joke, while Tyler is next to me is laughing quietly. After Tyler leaves at his house, me and Mom argue worse than before, since Tyler left, I was able to say things to my mom like, \"I hate it when you think I'm five\" and she would talk about how \"Tyler should have heard this to know that you're not comfortable with being pushed around\" I'm pretty mad at this, because I know that it's pure jokes (it's really just jokes).  This goes on and on, She treats my argument Like a joke, so when I brought up points like how when Kent sprayed ketchup on me on accident, he apologized. all she replied with was \"Uh huh\" and never acknowledged it, but It was just an accident. Even worse is my dad told me that it would escalate from accident, into a fight. I explained the generosity of my friends, and how they say sorry, he said that's a lie. We argued, I tried being serious to my mom about it, by telling her I'm not a child anymore. she didn't take me seriously.

I made a comment about it to me neighbor and this guy went “I can fix that!” Takes my phone and presses on it HARD, aaand my screen shattered (and mind you Im a broken college student living at home) he just gave it back to me “I tried” I was LIVID.

There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

He's put down deposits and requested people send him cash so he's not out of pocket for long.  We're talking about $2000 USD total for the week per person.  No problem, I look at the breakdown of costs to make sure I'm not overpaying as I don't want him to owe me money at the end of it as I suspect it's going to be a bitch to get it back from him.  I notice that they overcharged me $150, innocent mistake, I bring it to their attention and they tell me, np just pay us $1850.  I send it.  Incidentally right after I send payment, the other organizer says that the amount was for contingency / incidentals, but no big deal we'll just settle at the end.  A few days later, he brings the subject up again saying it's not fair to the group that I didn't pay the extra $150.  I explain that he said it was fine and I also let him know that the banker has been a notoriously slow payer to me and I don't want to have a balance owed to me by him by the end of this.  He disagrees as my issue with my friend has nothing to do with the group (which I don't think makes any sense since a balance will likely be owed one way or another).

He grabbed me and pulled me back as he usually does, and at that moment, it pissed me off. I didn’t say anything, but I yanked my arm back and continued crossing without him. \n\nOnce we were alone, we got into an argument about it; me giving him attitude by pulling away really hurt him. He said that he was just trying to look out for my safety, it wasn’t just because I was girl and he would have done that with any of his friends, and he thought I was going to run in front of a car because I was drunk. He was mad enough that he said didn’t want to see me for a couple days. \n\nI apologized and thanked him for looking out for me, and explained how it made me feel.

Eventually, while driving down some poorly lit back roads I catch up to a car going about 15 mph on 35 mph roads. I end up coasting behind them and using my brakes often, but I still maintained at least one car's distance between us. Also, they had been going that slow before I even got behind them. It was frustrating being stuck going slower than I wanted, but I figured they were just driving the speed they felt comfortable with considering the dense fog.\n\nAfter driving behind them for about 3 blocks they throw on their hazards. Now I'm thinking maybe something is wrong with their car? Except they turn them back off again after a few seconds. Finally, we both arrive at a light and wait to turn left onto a wider  road. \n\nAfter turning into the inner lane of this wider road I wait about 10 seconds for them to move into the slower lane because they are still only going about 20 (this new road is 55). They didn't move so I gave up, signalled, and went around them.\n\nAs I am getting up to the speed limit, they start accelerating to match my speed.

She tells me essentially that I am not allowed to park next to her since she has a baby on board sticker and that it’s my fault she hit my door because I should have known that. I told her I didn’t pay attention to her car when I was parking and that she could’ve loaded her car from the other side (which was empty) or she could park farther away if she needs more room (she was directly in front of the door) and that since I’m in the lines and did not exceed my time I did absolutely nothing wrong.

He asked me around 5:30pm if we’re grabbing dinner or if he should get something himself. I said I feel horrible but I’m absolutely shattered and would probably just fall asleep, and said can we do Sunday I said I’d take him out to lunch I’ll pay and we’ll watch a movie. I haven’t received a response. Now I think after him thinking I wanted out of the relationship plus now cancelling the date he thinks I’m not interested anymore. AITA for rescheduling a date when he already has doubts about me?",

We are both 23 years old and we have always been good friends but I can't help feeling like I was a little *too* straight up with what I said to him. I went a little too far but I felt it needed to be said. Anyway, here we go.  \n\n\nSo this guy, I'll refer to him as Steven, doesn't have a job and isn't actively looking for one either. He gets money from his parents as a type of 'allowance' because they don't work either and get government money because of medical reasons. He basically lives in his room most days watching Twitch and makes videos on YouTube in his free time that basically only me and one of our other friends very occasionally watch. Fair enough, he has an interest and he enjoys doing it which is completely fine with me, but I always just lightly and in a peaceful manner remind him to keep it as a hobby and to keep an eye out for something to support himself and to which he agrees. Only he never does anything about it.  \n\n\nHe always tells me how he is having a hard time and he never has the money to do anything with, to which he never really tells me *why* he is always so short seeing he literally gets given money for doing nothing. He would always give me a vague reason but I always just believed him, he was my friend why would he lie to me I guess? However just this weekend it was finally revealed as to why, and this was how it happened.   \n\n\nOn Saturday me and Steven were hanging out so we went to the movies to see Overlord (which was fairly average really) but surprise surprise as we got to the ticket booth he was a little short on cash so I stumped up for his cinema ticket once again. I am mostly used to it at this point but for some reason on that particular day it really got to me how I have probably spent more on Steven than I have my own Mother over the years. After we got to our seats I asked him what happened to his money seeing he told me on Wednesday night his parents gave him his 'allowance' because there was no chance in hell it was already gone, it had been two days. I looked him dead in the eye and just waited for the response, to which he finally and rather sheepishly told me he has used it all by donating it to god damn Twitch streamers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally sat there for a good 10 minutes speechless. All this time I have been paying for this guy over so many years for anything we do has all been because he has literally given away any money he has ever had. Every single last penny. I finally after staring into thin air trying to comprehend what he has just told me asked him why? Apparently he would rather, and I quote, 'let them have it and not give it to big companies because they have enough money as it is'.   \n\n\nThat was the last straw for me. I knew I had to say something because I felt like he not only had been mooching off me for so long but also his parents. It all suddenly became so clear to me that the reason he never has money is because he *gives it away.* I presumed he was using it to buy things like groceries or I don't know, maybe to pay bills with, is that too much to presume? Thank god the room we were in was empty because I couldn't keep it in. I told him that all this time he has been wasting his money on complete strangers he doesn't even know, and has basically been coming up with excuses as to why he never had money. I told him right there and then that is the last time I'm ever paying for him again. He doesn't like to give his money to big companies but he gives it away to strangers? He is happy enough for me to use all of my money on him to give to these companies? No. Enough. I told him how stupid he has been getting his money for nothing and using the money that his parents have given to him and wasted it, money they could have used on themselves for things they actually need to get by. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was saying this something in me clicked again and this is where I feel I went a little too far, but I told him that he is never going to get by in life if he doesn't get his life together and get a job, quit making YouTube videos that no one ever watches apart from me that from now on I won't be. He needs to get a job and to stop living like an ignorant child. If he doesn't accept that he has to get on with life and live in the society of the current world he is going to be on the streets once his parents are gone. I know that last part was a little over the top, but I want him to realize this is no way to live, this isn't normal. If he continues on like this much longer he is going to have it hard for real. I see him completely differently now, and I feel like I don't want to be around him anymore. All this time I thought he was using his money to support himself, but no. He was wasting it and using both me and his parents. He got up and walked out, I haven't seen him or heard from him since. Frankly I don't want to.  \n\n\nTell me Reddit, am I the asshole?   \n\n\nTL;DR: A friend/now ex friend of mine was always short on money even though he gets it from his parents for doing nothing so I would always spot him some or pay for him. Find out after years of knowing him the real reason he never has money because he gives it all away to Twitch streamers. Tell him he has basically been using me and wasting his own money and what I think of it, end friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I even remember I got us all in trouble once for licking a page in the Bible as a dare (from him). Eventually though, we all grew up and found our own path to God outside of our parents -- except for my brother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him, but he's always been the testy one. He's the one who would argue with my mother nonstop about trivial things like a bedtime even though she was just a single mother at the time with only the three of us. He's only really seemed to care about himself and his own sense of justice for most of our lives. He  told my mother that he is atheist about a year ago, and she took it a lot better than I thought. While not approving completely, she told him he was free to do as he wanted and that he was an adult capable of making his own decisions. But recently, her birthday came and she wanted all three of her children with her in church, as it happened to fall on a Sunday this year. Only two of us showed up, and you can likely guess who didn't. They got into a massive argument after that and he said things like \"that book is responsible for the death of my childhood.\" I think that's such an overstatement, as we had a much better childhood than we could have hoped for. \n\n  \nNot just that, but we've gotten into near-fistfights on multiple occasions because he's so damn resistant to anything remotely religious. I reached out to him with a scripture after our estranged father passed away and he threatened to block me. I was just trying to help. Then last week, after the whole birthday thing, I told him it'd be better if we didn't talk anymore. I think I'm going to try to convince my sister and mother not to talk to him anymore either, as I can't help but to view him as a threat to our happiness. I'm just doing what it takes to protect what family I have, and he's only given us negative experiences as of late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't hate atheists or harbor any ill will towards them, but I believe that you shouldn't really associate with people that are this tormented.

After I was born it got a little worse my mom started throwing fits because I was getting more attention than her. Eventually (according to my dad) she would starts fights so she could leave. She would leave for weeks at a time and then one day just show back up for a few days and she would start another fight. Sometime in 2006 she cheated on my dad and had a baby. The baby was taken because when it was born it was having withdraws from something so they tested the baby (and my mom)  both of them had meth in their system so my dad got his name off of the birth certificate and adopted the baby out of the family. The fights kept happening and my mom kept leaving for weeks at a time. About a year and a half later my mom cheated AGAIN with a different person who we will call G and low and behold she got pregnant. My dad said enough was enough and filed for divorce. The divorce happened and my little (half) brother who we will call B was brought into the world (and my mom stole my dads cat). Everything was fine for a while. Until my moms boyfriend (G) moved in with her. He was abusive as hell he would hurt B and I, my mom. G's friends eventually started making death threats towards me and B. My mom started picking up G's habits and would hit me and B (like a lot). So I begged my dad to keep me home. This went on for about a year until my mom decided that she wanted a new life and moved to a different state. I went and saw her the Christmas of that year. After that Me nor my dad heard anything from her. Not for FOUR years. Then one Christmas there's a gift card with a lot of money on it and a big letter of \"how she thinks about me everyday\" and \"how we need to rebuild our relationship\". I called her we talked for two weeks and shes silent again for about a year suddenly shes in town and demands that I see her. We went swimming at a hotel, and had food. Another 2 years of silence and boom another big gift card and another letter. I decided that I didn't want to talk to her because of all iv'e heard.

Watching TV or a movie is a different story but when we're in bed I want her to be focusing on me. \n\nI've asked her to stop many times because it makes me feel like she doesnt care about me or that she'd rather be on her phone than spend time with me. I've told her this and she tries her best but then sometimes she'll get a notification, look at it, and then get distracted with snapchat and start talking to her friends.\n\nI understand if it's time sensitive or important but I dont appreciate her just talking to other people. \n\nToday she jokingly said \"I'm going to go on my phone for 2 minutes and theres nothing you can do about it\" so I left and she got upset.\n\nDid I overreact? Is it too much to ask that she never goes on her phone when we're in bed? Maybe we should compromise in a way that I haven't thought of yet? Do most people go on their phones when they're in bed together and I'm just being weird?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated thanks in advanced.",

Today is Valentine’s Day and my husband (29M) and I (22F) typically just do something really small like dinner and small candy gifts. \n\nMy husband has a history of not getting me any gift at all for things (Christmas, my birthday, our anniversary etc.) because he typically forgets. Sometimes he’ll get me something retroactively, but sometimes he doesn’t. An important detail is that our birthdays, Valentine’s Day, and our anniversary all fall around the same time of year so it is kind of a lot all at once. \n\nThis year we were talking about our birthdays and I said “don’t bother getting me anything.” He argued that he would like to get me something so I said “I want you to make me a nice dinner.” (This is something I have asked him to do for the last 4 holidays and it still hasn’t happened.) He said he would do that. Then I asked about Valentine’s Day and he said “We’re definitely doing something.” \n\nToday, I arranged to have a bakery make a small personal sized cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and a chocolate heart for him. I got off work an hour early and came home to surprise him with it. He stayed home from work today because he is recovering from a fever and cough, but he was 90% better today and went out for errands. He wasn’t home when I got home, which was strange so I tried calling him. He didn’t answer, so I waited about 15 minutes and called again with a follow up text. No answer. I started to get really worried and called another 3 times in a row and still no answer. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later he calls me back and says “I was getting a haircut, but I’m coming home now. Is everything okay?” I said yes and see you soon. \n\nI thought he would be bringing something back for me for Valentine’s Day. But he came home empty handed, and seemed genuinely surprised that I got him something. I then expressed that I was a little hurt that he didn’t get me anything and his response was “Well, I had planned to get something on the way home but then you called me so many times I thought you were mad I wasn’t home so I just came straight here.” \n\nTo me that feels like a BS excuse and he forgot to get me something. I clearly told him on the phone that everything was good and I was just worried about him not answering for so long. I feel like he’s trying to flip it on me, like it’s my fault he couldn’t get me a gift. \n\nSo I took the chocolate covered strawberries for myself and I’ve been kind of snippy with him tonight when he asks me what I want to do. \n\nAITA for being upset that he didn’t get me a Valentine’s Day gift?

            "input": "In late high school I made friends with a dude one year my senior.  We were friends for a year, year and a half, maybe?  The context of this friendship: I needed a reason to get out of my house and away from my borderline-abusive sister, and he needed some company as his family grew busy and were rarely home.  Though we had little history, our relationship was cathartic, and we'd spew whatever the hell we had on our minds - basically, a lot of unfiltered thinking out loud, without fear of judgement.  From the start, we agreed on one thing: we were both very inexperienced socially, had social anxiety, and in my case the question of high-functioning autism has been raised by several teachers and doctors.  We were to be blunt and clear with each other, ask for clarification when we were confused.  No hidden resentments, no unvoiced objections about the other's rant of the day, etc.  No wondering if that tone was suggestive or not - we would ask, and we would know, and that was comforting to the both of us.\n\nThis also meant there was NO question about what we were.  We were not romantically involved.  Until the event I'll cover in a minute, I didn't think there was confusion even without our agreement to be blunt.  In fact, this was the first non-asexual person to whom I outed myself as asexual.  Whether or not me outing myself is relevant to what happened next, I am unsure.\n\nWe went to the drive-in movies one night.  I didn't have a car or a license, so we went in his car.  We left a little early to avoid the jam on the way out, and he told me he was out of gas.  Like, he was driving on E all day.  This is where shit got weird.\n\nHe wanted to go to the gas station near his house.  His house was WELL out of town, and that gas station was maybe like the tenth on the list of ones closest to us.  It struck me as odd, but I figured he might just have a coupon or membership or some other discount for that station, and since he'd paid for the tickets I didn't say anything about it.  I don't remember if I offered then, but if it were to happen now, I'd offer to pay for the gas (and insist on a closer station).  We get to that gas station and the outside lights are off, but the inside lights are on.  We can't see any other cars in the lot.  The gas station door sits wide open.  He locks me in the car and goes in, and then rushes back out.  There was no cashier, just someone in the back rifling through shelves.  We got the fuck outta there and he said \"There's this back highway by my mom's house, if we go down that for ten minutes we'll find a gas station there.\"\n\nAnd I think, *there's no way in hell we're driving ten more minutes out of town*.  If the gas ran out, we didn't need to be in the middle of nowhere (which - the town itself is just one tier above \"middle of nowhere\").  While I didn't have my license, I did have a learner's permit, and I knew the roads pretty well.  I told him we were better off returning to the drive-in and stopping at a gas station near there.\n\nFrom here, something in my gut was telling me something was *wrong*.  He would not make eye contact with me.  He was very intently focused on the road, which was unlike him.  He really didn't want to go back into town, and he started giving me excuses for it: we could just stop at his one of his parents' houses until one of them came home (in three hours).  We could still go to that other gas station he knew of.  I chalked this up to nerves and insisted no, we need to get out of dark residential areas and onto lit streets, we need to be near town where we have multiple stations and tow options, we need to stay where there's wifi/phone signal, etc., and he agreed we should return to town.\n\n2 minutes down the familiar highway into town, there's an intersection, and despite 1) agreeing to return to town and 2) him taking this route to school every day for the past 2 years, he is in the wrong lane when we pull up to the intersection.  He tells me that there's a cop here and it's too late, he has to head down this other single-lane road that leads out into the prairie.  And he doesn't say \"I'll u-turn\" or \"I'll turn around\", he says \"We'll look down that way for a gas station.\"  He wants to drive down that road.\n\nBut there *is no cop*, and I have no idea where that road goes, and this is where I realize that I might be in trouble.  I am locked in, I am far too small to get the wheel away from him, and nobody knows we are out here.  We weren't supposed to come this way, let alone down a road neither of us was familiar with.  I cannot let him take that road.\n\nI tell him to turn anyway, fuck the cop.  There's nobody else out here at 2 in the morning.  We're not hurting anyone.  And I *yell* this.  Loudly.  Over halfway through the intersection, he turns, and we resume the road back into town.\n\nFrom here, he continues to give excuses to get us off the main road.  \"I don't know this place\", \"this doesn't look familiar\", etc.  This is still the route he would have taken every weekday for the past two years.  It's... literally just take this highway, the only four-lane highway, all the way to the high school, where you turn onto the main street.  It's not a hard route.  I drove it once before this and I knew where we were.  I direct him to a gas station in the middle of town.  It is well-lit, no robbery this time.  While he's filling up I text my sister to tell her we're close to the house (my parents made her stay up and wait for me because last time I was out late, I got locked out of the house - I had no idea if she was actually waiting, though).  When he gets back in the car, even though she hadn't responded yet, I told him she texted me asking where I was and that I told her we were on our way.  My house was also quite a ways out of town, in the other direction - a route he was much less familiar with, but after hearing my sister was up and waiting, he had no more trouble navigating darker, smaller, more confusing streets to get to my house.\n\nOnce I'm safe, I write down what I remember happening for later reference and spend an hour calming down, then go to bed.  And what followed was years of me wondering what the fuck happened.  I cannot stress how bad my gut feeling had been that night.  I am a forgiving person.  I've forgiven and salvaged friendships from worse, believe it or not.  But that night every ounce of trust I had in this dude *evaporated*.  Every instinct I had was screaming *danger, danger*, to the point where I considered grabbing at the wheel anyway and forcing us off the road once we were a little closer to town and someone might stop to check on us.  I almost did, at that isolated intersection with the invisible cop.  Had his weird behavior been because of the robbery (which - I didn't realize until now, actually, that I never saw this robbery; I'm pretty sure he wasn't lying about what he saw inside b/c what I saw outside was also so strange), or had there actually been bad intentions?  If it *was* bad intentions, how far had he planned to go, and what had stopped him until I'd had the chance to contact my sister?  Not long after this happened, I wrote about the incident for a class.  It was a private assignment, just read by the teacher, and I kept the kid's name out of it (this teacher didn't know him, anyway).  The teacher said I was right to trust my gut.  Years after, I have come to the following conclusion, the only one that reconciles the strange events of the night, my gut feeling, and who I knew this dude to be:\n\nHe had no bad intentions.  He didn't go into it with a plan to put hands on me.  I think what he wanted was for us to end up in a house or in the car alone with nothing else to do so he'd have a chance to make a move, set the mood, whatever you'd want to call it.  I don't think he'd have touched me without consent.  But it just... never crossed his mind that locking me in his car and trying to force us first to his house and then into the middle of nowhere without telling me why would be *terrifying*.  It would breach our pact about being blunt, but we did have social anxiety, and maybe he took \"asexual\" to mean \"straight but a little nervous\" and decided a sideways approach was best.  Maybe, once we were parked somewhere, he would have bluntly asked.  But he never got farther than trying to set the stage, because of the robbery and my insistence we head back into town instead.  I am very certain that this is what happened.\n\nHe didn't contact me for two months after that.  He knew he'd done something wrong.  After some time had passed (though - keep in mind I was still processing what happened, hadn't quite reached the above conclusion, still had no idea what he'd intended that night) he asked if I wanted to join him for lunch or something.  I turned him down.  I was terrified of the thought of being alone with him again.  He invited himself to my graduation at the end of the school year, and I told my classmate - \"Don't leave me alone with him.\"  She didn't treat him badly or anything - in fact, they hung out with each other more than I did with either of them - but she followed my request without question.  He rode with me and my mother to the ceremony and we exchanged a few words, but he spoke mostly to my mother.  He was avoiding me, too.\n\nI never addressed him directly about what happened, and that's where I wonder if I'm the asshole.\n\nSee, I was afraid to be alone with him, but this wasn't something I could ask him about in front of others.  I could have texted, but every time I chickened out.  It seemed like a conversation best had face-to-face, like texting would result in misunderstandings and reading with the wrong tone.  If his answer was \"No, I was just nervous,\" I don't think I would have believed him right away.  And if his answer was \"Yes, I wanted to get us alone toge",

My boyfriend insisted that I come back with him since his roommate wasn’t there for the night, and I kind of didn’t want to. He got visibly upset with me so I agreed to come back with him. He hadn’t gotten any sleep the night before, so it was strange to me that he wanted to initiate sex being so tired. \n\nWe had some pretty great sex imo, but he wouldn’t finish. I tapped out after 15 minutes and he dragged it on for longer, and then, out of the blue, he asks for anal. We had never done that before, and I wasn’t even sure about how it felt nor was I mentally prepared. He had completely stopped what he was doing and kept insisting for it, so thinking that it might get him to finish sooner, I say yes, with a very clear boundary that if I said to stop, it meant we were stopping. I had read about it before hand so there was some preparation. \n\nHe was respectful throughout the whole thing, took it very slow, he said he was enjoying it a lot, but again, he wouldn’t finish and I don’t know why. He just kept going until I felt nauseous and told him to stop, I was out, I was exhausted and I couldn’t continue any type of intercourse at this point. \n\nHe stopped, cleaned up, and was very upset because he didn’t finish. I asked him why he wasn’t able to finish and he said he was holding back cause he really wanted to keep going, but I find that extremely hard to believe, going on for a little over 45 minutes at this point. He asked for a blowjob and I tried that but he was just taking way too long, at this point I felt like he wasn’t into me, nothing I did got him to finish and he ended up falling asleep very upset with me. I cried and I left on my own, and messaged him at 4am that I was hurt and didn’t want to talk for a while. \n\nHe messaged me and I told him my thoughts and he said that I was being petty and if I wanted to feel sorry for myself then to take as long as I want. I feel humiliated, I feel like I’m no good at sex and I’m still hurt and upset.\n\nAm I over exaggerating my feelings?

Sobriety needs to be maintained and we both aren’t there yet.\n\nOne day she posts on instagram a video of doing some lean, and that just upset me. Not that she was doing drugs, just that she repeatedly lied to me (and there’s the possibility she was lying to herself as well).

She was first turned onto this by the “Mommy Group” at her church.\n\nHer church/religious background: my friend was raised in a cult and unfortunately bears the scars of someone introduced to ultra-extreme conservativism at a young age. Even though she fled the cult, she gravitated to a man who made her join his religion to be with him (publicly, I might add as they’d been sleeping together for a while). She gave up dreams to be a doctor for this guy and dropped out of college and used her college savings on a wedding.\n\nAlthough I was sad about this, and even a down right bitch at times, I’ve learned that friendship is about staying supportive through the hurdles. We’ve had gaps in our friendship before from fights that devastated us and it would be too difficult to do this again.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nThe church has “Elders” who manage the church. Enter 7 nondescript aging white guys. The “Elders” (not kidding, that’s their name), have women and male groups split up and it’s clear that while the men talk business and the future of the church, the women have been overcome by anti-vaccine propaganda. It’s very clear that the “Elders” are not involved nor concerned about the stuff in the women’s group, and I really don’t think they know the levels of insanity this group is at right now. \n\nI’m so so tempted to write to the pastor, as my friend (who is very young and impressionable) really doesn’t do anything her pastor won’t tell her to do. She would be personally offended if I said anything to her about her kids. As much as I’m disappointed in my friend, I’m mostly pissed off at the mommy group for brainwashing the young moms. My friend went through post pardum depression and I feel like they knew how to exactly sink their claws into her when she was so vulnerable. \n\nHer kids are truly wonderful and I get upset every time I see a kid with measles because it’s so preventable. A ton of moms now don’t vaccinate and they work together on getting paperwork finalized for religious exemption or they pull their kids from school to home school them. \n\nI worry for her and her beautiful family, but I really want to give a fucking wake up call to the pastor who does not have any idea this is being taught in his church.\n\nI feel like I’m obsessing or being controlling, and I can handle the honest truth as this has been on my mind for some time. I unfortunately grew up ultra religious and I know the pain that comes from that may make me more upset than the average person. \n\nTL;DR: friend’s church has a mommy group that is teaching anti-vaccine propaganda to young, new moms without the churches knowledge. I would like to write an anonymous letter to their pastor to tell him about the uprising of anti-vaxx propaganda from their women’s group.\n\nHoping for clarity ",

It was expected, but it still hit me and my mom hard. My girlfriend reacted to the news with shock when I told her.

The moment my girlfriend heard, she broke down--crying in a way that I have never seen her cry. She was so mortified by this, and I sat down with her, reminded of the day that my father died and the way that I broke down. She started talking about Spiderman, her favorite comic book series.

At the time, I accepted this.\n\nStan Lee is a media legend, sure, but she didn't even know him. My dad was someone that she sat down and ate dinner with. My dad was someone that she met, and she couldn't spare any tears for him. I was very upset. I told her these things, yelling when I said it. She stopped crying and looked shocked--and even in the moment, I knew that I shouldn't have exploded like that. We decided that we will talk about this tomorrow.\n\nLook. Roast me. Tear into me.

He knew for a fact that I was just 2 feet behind him.  First thing that came to mind was being worried that he might get with girls that treat him like shit (he did before). \n\nI was at first upset that he chose to lie to me even at the very last moment of the relationship... but later I found out more and more that made me pretty upset and angry. \n\nHe kept saying he did not feel anything for the girl until after we broke up - truth is he’s been talking to some mutual friends about this girl just 2 hrs before the breakup, and it was them who said dude this is not cool you gotta end stuff before you can do anything... so he broke up with me 2 hrs later. \n\nWhen we were together, he always told me he couldn’t make plans cos “his mom makes all the decisions” and he has no say over his schedule (he’s 23 now btw.) But to my surprise, he managed to convince his entire family to go on a trip just to travel to see the new girl.\n\nThen slowly I came to realise that he was never faithful. He once lied to my face about how he injured his knee while I was literally kneeling in front of him, doing his wound dressing for him. He lied about the most trivial things, and when I ask questions he would cover it with another lie, then another. \n\nSo after discovering all that, I found the girl on social media. I told her that he lied to me countless times and cheated on me (made out with girls when we were together). I read what I typed many, many times to make sure it was just stating facts, (i.e. he told lies a lot, cheated on me, and the exact time we were together - cos apparently he lied to his family and friends about that too).  I showed some of my friends to make sure the tone was fine. \n\nAll I wanted to do was to let her know... cos if I were in the same position, I would want to at least know that this person (at least “used to”) treat his SO this way, and to take what he says with a grain of salt. \n\nI was certain there is always a possibility that the girl feels I was talking rubbish, or she might think he’d change for her or whatever. I wasn’t trying to make a choice FOR her. INFORMED DECISION was what I was concerned about. \n\nOf course, his friends and family thought I was taking revenge. They said “how dare you who gave you the right to do that?” I really, really wanted to say, I really don’t need anyone’s permission to talk to her...? But I didn’t.

Without my friends and my parents i probably wouldnt be where i am right now and i spent the first few weeks talking with them about what happend so i could process it. \n\nAlmost everybody told me that i should not answer her messages or calls anymore, and that was just what i did. Of course she kept writing me, but i just ignored her. After a few months it started getting better and i didnt have to think about her all the time.\n\nNow, after almost 1 year (all this took place in June 2018), she is blaming me that her conscience is bothering her and that she has to think about me alot, that she cant concentrate on her studies and that the relationship with her new bf suffers from her having to think about me. So basically she states that all this happened because i didnt want to settle things with her, but i really dont give a damn about what she thinks or how she feels now. AITA for this?",

So i’m a senior in high school, and i broke up with my girlfriend a month ago after about 7 months of dating. We had been very good friends before dating, and I was very happy with her. However, I have had anxiety for a couple years, and have been on meds to combat it. However, I had a very bad episode a month ago and simply wasn’t in a good place. We ended having a messy breakup with mistakes from both of us. I wasn’t engaged wit her as much as I should have been and was probably neglecting her emotionally, and she told me to basically get over my anxiety. We haven’t really talked since the breakup, but at our school’s football game last week, we ended up getting in a arguement. We said some things and then with most of the student section listening, she told me to go home and pop pills to deal with my fake anxiety. I was pretty upset and blurted “how my dick taste tho” Our classmates found it very funny, but she started crying. She’s very christian, and she probably was upset that her activities were out to everyone. It’s been a couple days and I kinda feel like i overreacted. Am i the Asshole? ",

They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked “are there any girls I should be worried about” This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn’t seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn’t a big deal. \n\nEverything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. \n\nGF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly have ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone one dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. \n\nI apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said “no worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes” (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I did tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. \n\nWe got into the biggest argument about how I didn’t have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up to ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can’t be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. \n\nShe’s now back on a plane, and we will discuss further once she clears her head.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

She’s blond, kind of short and good looking, she’s a bit nerdy and the type to say sorry to a fly after she squashed it she has the “cute girl next door” look.\n\n**Mark:** My friend. He’s tall has dark hair and glasses, he’s very funny a bit dorky but one of my very best friends. He’s a country boy and usually dresses more practically then anything else.\n\n**Michael:** Me. I’m blond, average height, pretty good looking (if I do say so myself) though rather skinny and usually wear a dress shirt and some nice pants.\n\n**Background:** \n\nFrey, Mark and I all started in the same class some years ago. Mark and I quickly became friends as we have the same kind of humour. The first time I talked to Fray was in German, we had to work in groups, Fray and I were paired. a bit later we got to catch up at a preparty and ended op kissing at most of the night at the party the day after I really didn’t know what to text her as I had only been in one previous relationship, while I was pondering she ended up texting me a bit later we ended up discussing what we actually where, after being asked by almost all of the school, we came to the conclusion that she would like to be my girlfriend and I would very much like to be her boyfriend. \n\nJust before we began in school my little sister was diagnosed with cancer and she was in the hospital for over 9 months only coming home a handful of times. It really took a toll on me and I got kind of depressed thought I did my best to hide it from everyone, I hate talking about my problems and didn’t want to make it even harder for my parents or my little brother if they also had to worry about me. Fray was exactly what I needed, finally something good happens to me. I don’t know if it really played a role, but I thought I would include it just in case.\n\nThe relationship for the next long time went great, she loved me, and I loved her more then anything, until she ended it. I followed her to her bus almost every day (a 20-minute walk) there we could talk, complain about school, hold hands and I could get a goodbye kiss. One day she wouldn’t hold my hand, she kept her hands in her pockets, I didn’t think anything of it as it was cold. The day after that again she wouldn’t hold my hand and I could the something was bothering her, but she wouldn’t tell me what, when her bus came, I said “goodbye, I love you” as I always did, her response? “mmhhmm” this broke my heart, it wasn’t a big deal but damnit that hurt. The day after our school held a large party (the same kind that we hooked up at) and I hosted a preparty at my house for the class, she would avoid me the whole day I just drank some more and tried to have fun. When we got home to me after the party and went to bed, she would lie almost over the edge of the bed aka. As far away from me as possible. By this time, I had begun to see what was coming and just wishing she would just rip the bandage off and get it over with instead of this torture. The next morning, she said we had to talk and she broke up, she began crying so I did my best to comfort her while dying inside I send her on her way home and just sat thinking why she broke up, she never gave me a reason, so I felt I was something I had done or said but I couldn’t think of anything. I had difficulty sleeping as I felt guilty because of whatever I had done, and it didn’t help that I had to see her every day in school. Just to say the breakup was very hard on me, I still loved her, but I knew she didn’t feel the same way anymore.\n\nTime went and I started getting over her. After a rather large party I hosted an after party for a small group of friends, Mark asks me if its okay he invites Fray, I couldn’t see a reason she shouldn’t be aloud to come so of course I say she could. Half an hour after she arrived her and Mark were not to be found anywhere, I had just emptied my last beer, so I headed down to my room to fetch my Gin for a Gin n’ Tonic. Then I open my door the first thing I see is Fray and Mark in my bed, they weren’t doing anything just lying side by side talking, I didn’t know what to do so I just said hey got my liquor and went op to the others. I know I wasn’t a lot, but it really got to me seeing my ex, with my best friend, in my bed, the same bed I used to be with her in. some days later another good friend told me he saw it too and asked what I thought about it.\n\nI noticed them beginning to talk each other more and more I school, I even felt happy for them both. \n\n**Now to the reason I write this in the first place.**\n\nsome time ago I got invited to a small house party by one of the girls in the class, she lives in the country and I in the middle of the city so it was a good bit away so I arrange with my mother that she would drive me home when I called, she was happy to do so but of course it would take some time. All the girls invited arrived a couple of hours before so they would have some girl time before the guys came, but as the only dude Mark was also invited to come early, I thought it was strange but maybe transport would be easier if he came early. When I arrive, I was greeted by everyone with a hug, apart from Mark and Frey as Fray had leached on to Marks arm, I give him a handshake and a pad on the shoulder. The party went smoothly and it was fun to let loose, talk and play drinking games with all the others. Most of the party leave early and take a taxi to the dance club, I can barely eat with a fork let alone dancing especially drunk, so I thought Id stay a bit see what happens and maybe call my mother soon. We ended up being only Mark, Fray, the girl who hosted the party and me. We sat in the sofa watching Die hard and eating leftover pizza from earlier and let me tell you Mark and Fray did not watch any of the movie, they were cuddled up exactly the way we always used to when “watching movies” aka. Making out. This really fucking hurt! I called my mom and she came after like half an hour.\n\nIt might not true seeing I was drunk, but I swear se glanced at me all the time, I tried to ignore it as I didn’t want to course any drama.\n\nThe day after I text Mark something like “Hey, listen I don’t get to say who you can and can not be in a relationship with, but you have to see this from my angle and understand it isn’t easy seeing my ex being together with my best friend. If you really like each other of course you should be allowed to, but damn it hurt watching you and Fray yesterday lying exactly as we used to. I think you deserve to know how I feel and I hope you respect me enough to have this in the back of the head when I am near” he said he was happy I texted him and of course he would.\n\nSince this they slowly stopped talking as much as they did before, I don’t know If I really did end their relationship before it started, however I feel like shit knowing it’s a possibility, so I must ask am I the asshole in this situation? \n\n**TL-DR:**\n\nMy long-term girlfriend broke up with me and quickly after start baking on my friend, so I text him that it hurts seeing them together. Since I did, they haven’t talked as much, AITA?",

            "input": "Now I'm not a particularly passive person, if I see something I think is wrong I tend to point it out. Stand up for what I think is right and all. Now when this young girl started working with us I wasn't sure where I stood with her. We have a small workforce, only about six people, so I work in a close environment with her most of the day. She can be moody and very rude and negative unless you catch her on a good day. \n\nNow she's about nineteen and some of her behaviour I put down to her being very immature for her age. She seems to want people to see her as this badass, edgy, straight talking person who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. I suspect she cares. And I've learned after getting to know her better that her home life is not the best, I have reasons to believe there may be some level of abuse. She told her her mother once threw an ashtray at her and punched her hard enough her face bruised, then giggled about it. I told her it wasn't alright for anyone to lay hands on her and she started crying. So I hugged her and told her if she ever felt unsafe then she could call me and I'd open my spare room to her. Since this incident I've been trying to be understanding of her sour moods and have been paying closer attention to her good qualities. She's very funny for a start, though I like blunt and sometimes harsh humour - as does everyone else in the workplace. She can be kind, when she's not trying to act macho, and she's a hard worker too. \n\nWell we were having a cheerful debate at work over something unrelated and this girl steps in saying we should debate other things. Then, in an act I can't help think is designed just to draw attention, flatly states that she's a racist and we should debate about that. We ask questions, obviously, and she comes away with things like \"I hate Pakis. If there's a Paki on my bus I'll get off at the next stop and catch a different one.\" and \"If one started working here I'd quit.\". She also takes the time to clarify that by \"Paki\" (I'm sorry about the slur, I'm just quoting her) she didn't mean specifically anyone from Pakistan, but actually meant \"anyone brown\", namely Middle Eastern and Indian people. The first thing I said is that I think that's disgusting behaviour. She defends her opinion saying that when she was young her uncle said if she misbehaved he'd put her in a black hood and send her away to them. I argued that, though that's disturbing, it doesn't justify her words or actions. \n\nBut everyone else was quiet and my manager tried to diffuse the situation by sort of going along with her. Basically telling her 'yeah, we know you don't give a fuck. Your opinion's your opinion, it's whatever'. She tried a few times to encourage conversation about it, saying that she doesn't care if we think she's an asshole and that she's not going to lie about what she thinks. But after a while nobody said anything, it was awkward. And again, I'm not convinced that she doesn't care what people think and part of me wonders if this is some weird, pathetic trick she's got to try and seem edgy. Either to get attention, bad or good, or to push people away. \n\nI can't exactly psychoanalyse her so I won't know exactly what's behind it. But it bothers me that work is just going on as normal and that everyone is joking around as normal. I've remained civil but I feel bad about laughing when she tells jokes. And the other day she was standing in the rain waiting for the place to open so I let her sit in my car with me until our boss arrived. I had to attend our works' Christmas night out and she danced with me on the floor. On one level I worry about her situation and have started getting along with her, but one part of me wants to completely disassociate from her and only speak regarding work. I already voiced my opinion, I'm not sure what else to do. \n\nSo am I being an asshole here? Could I be doing more?",

At 6 am, I noticed that we were missing an important part of a drawing project due later. I hadn't noticed before.\n\nI texted F and she got mad that I didn't tell her sooner. I figured she wouldn't fix it (school lends us PCs &amp; wacoms, and we had two free periods so there shouldn't have been an issue), so I did a quick painting over my template (she was supposed to follow it so this wouldn't happen). I didn't use F's drawing bc I thought it would be rude to change it. \n\n\nFastforward to 30 minutes before the class, we're sitting in a classroom. G and other 2 students were there. I showed F what I had done in those 2 periods. Once again, F brought up that it was my fault for answering so late. I told her \"you had the time and means\". F got mad and continued talking loudly. Then, F got angry at T over the gc for not submitting the image to the teacher. No one had told T to send it, but we all assumed he was going to. I told F something like \"you can't expect T to send the image when you didn't even send it to him through e-mail. You sent a low-resolution jpg in the gc.\" \n\nShe got louder \"No one told me to send it. How was I supposed to know?\" I thought this was hypocritical of her and told her \"You already know the gc sends low-quality images. No one should have to tell you, you're not a little girl-\" \n\n\nF cut me off, shouting: WELL, YES, I AM A LITTLE GIRL\n\n\nG &amp; I: no, you're in university-\n\n\nF: I HAVE THE MIND OF A LITTLE GIRL, YOU SHOULD TELL ME THINGS AS IF I WAS A LITTLE GIRL\n\n\nG: no, you're not, and- Me: Ok, don't interrupt- (at the same time) \n\n\nF: I'LL INTERRUPT ALL I WANT BC YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR THINGS I DIDN'T DO AND NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT.

We started hanging out, watching movies together, talking etc...\n\nSo one day we go out with our classmates to a pub and I don’t drink much but she gets completely drunk. Since she lives really far away and there’s no bus at that time of night, I offer her to come to my place and sleep it off. She does come and I do my best to be a decent host, making her a bacon and egg midnight snack and getting her room ready.\n\nThree weeks after that we go out again, this time to another student’s place and then to a club and, this time, we planned for me to come back to her place. Since that night she has been avoiding me so I must have fucked up in some way, I just can’t figure out how. Here’s what I did :\n\n- I hit on a guy and left her w one of her friends for about one hour but we met again at the club and I left the guy behind, she didn’t seem bothered by that since she was w other people we knew.\n\n- I got really (REALLY) drunk during the night and ended up being sick on the way home. I’m not an annoying drunk, I’m the \"super honest and affectionate\" kind but I was really fucking plastered and she wasn’t.\n\n- I can’t remember maybe 20-30mn of that night so I might have done something then? I just know that I added the guy I mentioned before on Facebook but idk what else I did. She hasn’t mentioned anything when I asked.\n\nAnyways she hasn’t been talking to me since then unless I try to contact her and usually her answers are pretty dismissive when, before that night, we were really friendly.

She never mentioned not wanting me to drink before coming to her place either.\n\nIt’s been about ten days since that night and I still have no idea of what I did that caused this.",

I just wanted reddits opinion. \n\nLast week, my friend (Rob) and I visited Victoria, B.C., and we came back to Vancouver on a ferry that was absolutely full. It was the most popular crossing time back home and throughout the duration of the crossing, the steward kept making announcements to please remove jackets and bags from seats because people have no where to sit. Stupidly, my friend and I decided to eat before finding a seat. Once we were done, we walked around the ferry, all levels, trying to get a seat with no luck. Finally, we came across a row of seats that were empty, with 2 books taking up seats right in the middle. In my brain, this meant that those 2 middle seats are \"reserved\" by someone, so my friend and I took the seats on the sides (aisle and window). We both thought this would be fine, as we left the \"reserved\" seats empty. 20 minutes later, a couple comes by. I was reading, Rob was sleeping. I heard them talk (not English) so I looked up at them and then they asked me why we took their seats. I haaaate confrontation as I have pretty bad social anxiety. I politely told them that my friend and I were looking for seats and we took the 2 that were empty. They are welcome to return to the 2 seats they reserved. Then they told me that they had in fact reserved all 4 seats and that their friends are coming back. I apologized again, but I said I wouldn't move because:\n1. Only 2 of 4 seats were \"reserved\". \n2. There were 4 people in their party, they couldve left someone behind to guard their seats. They brought their food and drink over to the seats so it's not like they just went to eat in the cafeteria area of the ferry. They were going to eat in their seats. \n3. Rob and I walked over 20km that day, I wasn't going to walk all over the damn ferry again. It was too cold to sit outside. \n\nI would appreciate your opinion. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, am on mobile. \n\n",

She’s a messier person than I am but has a “holier than thou” attitude when it comes to cleaning and it’s only gotten worse. I’m talking literal shit covering the toilet after almost every use, a shower that had never been cleaned before I moved in, and the kitchen is always in a state. IE the trash can is overflowing after a day, counters are dirty, and the fridge has food rotting in there for weeks and even months at a time. I’ve been cleaning it all up until about 3 weeks ago. I don’t ask her for anything in return and honestly have given up even trying to talk to her bc she just ignores me when I try. Today I overheard her bitching about the trash not being taken out and also stating that she’s “tired of having to clean up after everybody”. \nTo keep this shorter I’m going to say that I clean up after myself and leave any mess that they make for them (minus the toilet bc that’s just disgusting). We don’t talk to each other and she leaves passive aggressive notes for me. I have 4 months left in my lease so I’m just trying to keep my head down and get out as soon as I can (I stay in my room for the most part.) AITA?",

I have a social disorder and I can’t tell when someone’s being serious or not, as well as anxiety and depression, so I took it seriously. This isn’t the first time this group has made jokes making fun of me; C pretends to bully me and I’m fine with it, but I’ve started to read too much into it.\n\nLong story short, I left youth group in tears and didn’t respond to E and C’s texts asking where I went. I later returned after finally talking to E, where she told me I was only noticing the times everyone was saying things about me. I trust and love E and I don’t at all think this was gaslighting or anything, and I think I was reading too much into it. When I got back, everyone acted differently and a lot more gentle with me.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve broken down in front of these people. I love them and I’m afraid that I’m being a toxic friend and that they feel they have to walk on eggshells around me. AITA?",

I have met the one a few times but not the other. Everything was going well and the party was a fun time until these two new people decided I wasnt drunk enough for them and started pressuring me to drink shots with them. By this time I was at a perfect drunk for myself and didn't want to push my limits so I declined. They became annoyingly insistent getting everyone in the party to call me a pussy and other names and make the whole focus of the party on me drinking this nasty ass rum. Eventually I caved and drank a shot but that wasnt good enough either and these two people kept harrassing me to drink. A few more shots deep and I was at the point of no return and blacked out. I threw up and passed out and felt that hangover for two days.\n\nI know my drinking limits and I am very good at finding the right buzz for the occasion. I dont need to be told to drink and I was very pissed off both at myself for letting them pressure me and these people for forcing me to. \n\nCut to this weekend where I was invited to another predrink and bar night. I talked to Dave and discussed the plan and whatever. We had a two hour conversation catching up and I told him how I felt about his friends he invited and I asked who was all going this time and they werent mentioned. Cool.\n\nI show up and we are all having a good time but then Dave shows up with these two friends of his. Immediately they are on my case to drink. I flat out told them no and they wouldnt let it go. 5 minutes into them joining our party I am yelling at them to leave me alone. Dave knows how I felt about last time and he is just watching this go on and also at points is encouraging them. \n\nThis goes on the whole night. I told myself I wouldn't let them persuade me this time and they didn't but because of that night the whole night I was harrassed because I wouldn't drink with them. They tried every berating insult they could muster to the point people came up to me including Dave's girlfriend apologizing for their behavior. \n\nI ignored it the best I could and focused on making it a good night for myself. Well the next morning they're in one of our fb group chats mocking me even more and I am just done with these guys. \n\nI talked to our other friends and they agreed they didnt enjoy these guys' company and I called Dave and told them I didnt ever want to be involved in plans with them again. If he wants to hangout with them power to him but they're assholes who can't take no for an answer and I asked him to stop bringing them around me. He agreed and I thought the issue was over.\n\nCut to 10 minutes later he adds them to our call and asks me to explain why I dont want to hangout with them anymore.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I felt so betrayed in that moment that Dave would sell me out like that and force a confrontation with these guys I dont even know or want to further socialize with. I hung up on him and then called him back and tried to explain how mad he would be if I betrayed him like that. He didn't understand how I was mad and didnt think it was a big deal.\n\nI haven't talked to him since and we have an event planned this weekend that I have told everyone I wont be going to.\n\nAm I overreacting? Or am I justified in not wanting to see Dave for awhile.",

And they kept asking the cops if it was legal to call 911 on a homeless person asleep at a park because \"It scares me that they are spending so much time at a park where children play and I fear that they might attempt to kidnap my children or follow me home\" \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, we broke up into small groups and talked about the homeless most of the time. I was biting my tongue the whole time because I am sort of an \"imposter\" in the group. Like I am not a religious person/never been baptized or anything, and I'm not even sure where I stand on God and all, but I like to keep an open mind, and i have met some awesome friends though this meeting so i keep attending. But ot got to the point where I just couldn't keep it in any longer. Some woman said something along the lines of \"You always need to be so careful anywhere you go. There are so many terrible and sick disgusting men in this world. The rec center is the worst, but certainly never let your kids go to any trailer parks even if you are having a mommy and me play date. Like if you find out your friend lives in a trailer it would be best to never go to her house. Trailer parks are just disgusting. And the rec center is even worse because theres creepy old men there and the homeless go there to shower and shave since its cheap, and they spend all of their time in the hot tubs and just wait for the perfect time to abduct a child!\" \n\n\n\nAnd I shit you not. There was numerous stories about how the homeless were so scary and its just best if you never make eye contact and just bassically pretend they don't even exist.... \n\n\n\nThis is where I lost my shit. I interjected and let them know that I have spent so much time with the homeless population, and that I,myself, have actually panhandled/begged for money as well as lived out of my car when i was a young teen. I told them some personal stories and tired to show them that not ALL homeless people are looking for an easy way to support a drinking/drug habit, and I even encouraged them that it is totally possible to talk to a homeless person and not magically get abducted. But i certainly let them know that the gross judgement they were making was not only sickning, but also extremely non-christian. \n\n\n\nThey immediately changed the topic but i could still sense the tension, so AITA for sharing my opinion/experience when I was so pissed off that a group of women could be so judgemental?

            "input": "  \n\nBit of a long one here but bear with me. So this happened about 2 months ago and I have opinions from my friends but I wanted other peoples’ opinions on the matter. Over the summer my friend was at her annual army training for a month, away from her boyfriend, this has never been a problem for them because it would be her second time doing this while they were together, not to mention her leaving once a month to go on drill. Anyway she comes back and they begin having some relationship problems, mostly about what they want to do with their lives, I should also point out he is nearly 4 years older than her (almost 25 now). He has his life set and a career in front of him and she wants a career in the army which could send her basically anywhere in the world.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and they “break up” for the first time, so to take her mind off of it we decided to go out with a group of friends for some drinks, she planned to sleep on the couch at my house and her boyfriend did not like that fact (I am a guy and he has never been a fan of me). So when she left that was when they “broke up”. When we were out and she got some drinks in her it was like she never even was dating him, let alone the fact that they were together not hours earlier, but she was just all over any guy that would give her attention, especially other guys in ROTC with her.\n\nThis cycle continues a couple more times and one day when I was home over the summer she texted me saying she wanted to hook up with me and that she has wanted to for a while now, she was of course, absolutely wasted, and complaining that her boyfriend doesn’t pay any attention to her like she needs it. I texted her that she is going to regret what she is saying in the morning and she did. Then I get a call from her saying that she had gone home and slept with a bartender from that night and that she didn’t know what to do or how to explain anything to her boyfriend. This is when I tell her she has to be up front with him about it and take whatever he does on the chin or just break up with him.\n\nShe opts for neither and decides to not tell him anything for a while. I let it slide because I knew she was trying to figure some stuff out about her future. But then she started hooking up with the lieutenant that was in charge of her at school. For those that don’t know thing about the military this is a BIG no no. this went on for a while and it started to really irritate me because she would be late to meet ups with myself and other friends because she was “busy” with this guy. During this time, her and her boyfriend were going through a rough patch but they weren’t officially broken up yet. Eventually I confronted her about the whole thing and told her she was jeopardizing her future by doing this and a fling when you’re this young isn’t worth risking your career.\n\nShe takes my advice and afterwards it seems like she is going to cut things off with her boyfriend officially and just be done… until he came to her house crying one night because he missed her, and she bought the whole thing. I will point out she did tell him she had been talking to other guys during their rough spot but he didn’t care that she had been “talking” to other dudes.\n\nEventually I hit a breaking point, people had recently been not up front with me about important things and I didn’t think what she was doing to him was at all fair, so I told him, “I know you’re not my biggest fan but I am not one of the guys that she hooked up with”. This of course started a shitstorm of epic proportions, my friend even tried messaging the girl I had recently ended things with asking if she wanted to do “mean shit” to get back at me.\n\nI dint feel bad for what I did because if I were the guy I would want to know the truth about what is going on, plus from my point it was a generally unhealthy relationship on both sides (I really think he is just staying with her because he wants to be engaged with someone in less than a year) so big question, am I the asshole for doing what I did and exposing my best friend to her boyfriend?",

But my friends don't seem to understand that. \n\nWhen I first got it, I was sleeping around 20 hours a day. The cataplexy was so bad doctor's though my muscles had atrophied. I could barely lift my arms above my head. Since I was sleeping so much I couldn't eat as much, and I dropped down to 79 pounds (I'm 4'11, so it's scary but not like super life threatening). It's gotten better since then, but it still effects me greatly. A couple weeks ago I was hanging out with my friends and mentioned that the pharmacy fucked up my meds again and that I was genuinely worried about how I was going to handle myself until I got them back. I'm in college and I've already missed a lot of classes at this point because of my narcolepsy, even with my meds. Without them I cant function. One of my friends kinda laughs it off like \"you'll be fine\", another one says \"just drink coffee\". \n\nA little bit before that, I had sat down individually with my friends and told them what to do if I had a narcoleptic attack in front of them, especially in public. I can kinda feel them coming on, so I'm very very good at sneaking off to have sleep attacks in private. Because of this, none of them had even seen me have a full blown attack. Anyways, I told them to help me get to somewhere safe and private, help me take my meds and let me sleep for around 15 minutes before trying to wake me up. Simple stuff. \n\nSo I was real sick of them not taking my illness seriously. They don't need to baby me or anything, just understand that sometimes shit is really hard for me and it's scary. I was hanging out at one of my friends places with some other people about a week ago, and I got an idea. I wanted to see if they actually listened to what I told them before. So I dramatically stood up and collapsed onto the floor (my real attacks arnt that flashy, since I know how to deal with them).  My friends are confused. They don't know what to do, until one of them reminds the others I'm narcoleptic. So what do they do? Put a blanket over my body and leave me in the middle of the room. Fantastic. I stay down for 10 minutes maybe (trying hard not to actually fall asleep) before getting up and excusing myself home. It definitely made some of the people there uncomfortable. \n\nI feel manipulative for pulling this 'test' on them. \n\nAITA? ",

My manager has worked with me these past two weeks since the event, keeping my name on schedule, and open to ANY shifts I can make it too. She wants to help me no matter what and has left my name up, even when I went to jail for 3 days, she simply told me she's glad I'm okay.

She began this entire situation and can't be told anything she doesn't like. She's awful. She told me have a job, by the end of the week. I had this in a day. This job has nothing to do with the trouble I got in. That was in two entirely different cities, ACROSS a ferry system. This is a different place, I would go straight to work and back. Yet he wants to kick me out over it. I'm kinda prepared to let him no matter how hard things will be on me. I'm currently at my grandmas, thinking about what to do.

Plus 2 car payments, student loans, etc. You know, the typical bills everyone is overwhelmed with. My boyfriend makes close to 60k a year where I make closer to 35k. Our mortgage is roughly 1800 a month. We have a daughter together and I have 2 other daughters from a previous relationship. Currently, he refuses to get a joint account. I’ve tried to push combining our finances but he refuses at this point. I believe it’s because he distrusts me with money. So he currently pays for the mortgage, car insurance and his phone bill. I pay for everything else. The electric, water, both car payments, internet, Netflix subscription, daycare costs, our mutually shared credit card (that we used to pay for renovations in our home) and any other expense you can think of incurring. I foolishly wracked up over $6000 on a credit card by buying items for our home such as a new mattress and other household items. I can’t remember the last time I purchased something for myself, alone. Everything I purchase benefits all members of the family or is used by the family. I also have an agreement with my ex that I will claim the kids and give him a percentage that matches the amount time that he has the kids, so about 40% of what I received for the two oldest. \n\nNow, I did get a decent amount of money back this year. I was really excited at being able to pay my credit card off and having money left over for savings as it just makes me feel secure having it in there. Well, my boyfriend asked for his half of the return for the children since he provides for them also. So after paying off my credit card and giving him his portion. I now have only $300 in my bank account. Am I wrong for being pissed for having give this to him? Every pay period, I am struggling to keep my head above water with all the bills I pay. I’ve tried talking to him about how I understand he thinks it’s “fair” for us to pay 50/50 of the bills. But I think he struggles to comprehend that I also make nearly half of what he does. I’m constantly scraping by every month and never seem to be able save any money. \n\nAm I the asshole for being disgruntled and pissed off for having to give him half, leaving me with virtually no left over money for my own security?

She's 2 years older than me and she would always treat me like shit. Up until I was about 6, I adored her. I always wanted to be around her but she would always push me away. For example, at times she would just be playing on the computer and I would ask if I could sit in the room and play by myself so I wouldn't bother her. Then she'd hit me and yell at me until I would leave. Things like this happened on a daily basis. Eventually, I started having the same feelings towards her. I hated her and we would fight constantly. I've never been a big guy so she would always win, especially since she had 2 years on me. Basically, she made my childhood a living hell. I was also bullied a lot as a kid and she didn't do anything to stand up for me, in fact, she joined in at times. Specifically around 7th and 8th grade, I was bullied all the time because I was really small and a ginger, basically the easiest target there is. Going through puberty while being bullied by not only your classmates but also by your sister was really hard.\n\nTo give a little more background, my sister and I are polar opposites. She's an extrovert, she fit in with the popular crowd in high school and partied all the time. I'm very introverted as most of you can probably relate with. I like to stay in my room on the weekends and play video games. This was always something she used to make me feel bad. She would always call me a hermit and say I have no life. Any time she would get in trouble with my parents, she would try to take the attention off herself by bringing me up and saying things like, \"look at him, all he does is sit in his room!\" I always did that because I wanted nothing to do with her. I would insult her too, but rarely was I ever the first one to say something. I mainly just kept to myself so I wouldn't be her target.\n\nRight now, I'm a senior in high school and my sister is a sophomore in college. Within the past couple years we've tried to mend our relationship. We're on a lot better terms now than when she still lived with us. My parents kind of helped with that. My mom basically had to tell my sister how horrible she was to me as a kid because up until then, my sister thought it wasn't a big deal. When she was told that, she felt really bad and has been trying to get on better terms ever since, although at times she treats me just like she did when we were kids. This has been going on for the past 2 years, ever since she moved out. I still don't like her and haven't forgiven her for what she did to me. I haven't directly expressed this to her or my parents. Whenever I try to bring it up to my mom, she just tells me to get over it, and what happened is in the past. I find it hard to get over something that is still happening though.\n\nI don't want to make her seem worse than she is. My sister rarely treats me like shit anymore, but I think that has a lot to do with her not being around a lot. I don't talk to her often but when I do she's really nice. We go to movies together and talk a lot whenever she's home from college. Every once in a while though, she'll snap and everything will go back to when we were kids. Sometimes I snap too. I've said things that I regret, and I know my sister has too.\n\nI know my sister really wants to be on good terms, but I don't care to. I really couldn't care less if I don't see her for another 5 years. I still do care about her since she's my sister, but I really don't like her. It's a big point of contention in our family. Whenever my sister is around, problems start popping up left and right. My mom says it's because I'm holding onto a grudge. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Live together in a house we bought, have a dog, etc. I don't like beer, but always like to taste everything for science.\n\nLead up: Go out to dinner at a pub. Reviews said service can be slow. I order water, she orders random draft beer. I get my water right away, it takes her 15+ minutes to get the beer. We are sitting next to the bar and see those drafts going out left and right, seems like just busy. Joke around, speculate why it's taking so long, having a nice time. During this wait, we are sharing my water and since she drank it last, glass was on her side of the table. Waitress puts beer in front of me as from her perspective it made sense since I didn't have a drink in front of me. \n\nIncident: She walks off, we look at each other. A few seconds go by, fiance doesn't reach for her beer, I decide to do it for her and decided that while I have the beer in my hand(all about efficiency), might as well take a small(really small) sip to taste since I would do it at some point anyways. Put the glass on her side of the table and see her giving me a \"look\". Demeanor immediately changes and I start getting the cold shoulder. A bit confused, try to pry out what's wrong, but just silence. After a few minutes she asks me do I really not realize how rude I just was. I am still not 100% sure what I was rude about, but obviously something to do with me tasting her beer.\n\nConclusion:  Giving me cold shoulder for rest of the night, maybe 10 words exchanged max. Next day similar, again brings up that I was rude. I disagree. Me best guess is it's not that I had a sip as we share food all the time (see water above), but maybe it's because I had the first sip especially since it took so long to get to the table. I don't believe this exact argument has come up before in the 13 years, but she has expressed annoance if I try to eat off her plate at the same time as she has a fork in her own plate (so fine sharing as long as I am not disrupting her creating a \"perfect bite\") AITA for taking the first sip or overreaction on her part?

It’s kind of always been the agreement that C was mine and K was his. He’s going on a month long trip to Europe from Mid May to mid June, and I’ve already agreed to watch over both dogs for free while he’s gone, since he’s gonna pay rent for the whole month of May, but not June. I’m planning on getting a roommate mid-May or the start of June, but I don’t know who it’ll be yet so I have no idea if I’m going to have extra pets around or anything like that. When he gets back from his trip, he’s planning on moving straight back in with his parents, who live in a small suburb about 30 minutes from where we currently live. \n\nHis parents have a dog that doesn’t get along with any other dogs so he can’t take K if he moves in with his parents. However, he only is planning to live there until August, so he will move out and get his own place before the semester starts up again. He wants me to keep both dogs by myself until then. \n\nHere’s the thing- K is an extremely anxious dog. He’d get really bad separation anxiety when we’d leave and would bark incessantly, go through trash, destroy stuff etc.  He is also very emotionally attached to both myself and C. He can’t stand being locked out of rooms or separated from C in any way. C isn’t really the same way though, C is a very independent dog. I feel like if K spends from May-August with me and C, he’s going to get very used to that routine and be exponentially more anxious when it’s time for him to go live with just my ex. \n\nSo my ex is telling me that I’m ruining his living arrangements by telling him he needs to take K right when he gets back from Europe. I think he’s being irresponsible by leaving him for so long in the first place, but he’s telling me he’ll come do walks and play dates over the summer when he’s living with his parents. I just worry since they live pretty far it’s not going to be enough and it’s just going to make a stressful transition even more stressful. I love both dogs and don’t want to cause either undue stress. He said he’ll get his own apartment close by so they can still see each other though. \n\nK is also much more hyper than C. He needs significantly longer walks, needs more attention and is generally just more high maintenance. He also has very bad leash aggression so it’s really hard to walk both dogs at once by myself because of K’s outbursts at any dogs we pass on walks. So, I think it’s not fair of him to just leave me alone to deal with both of these dogs when I’m working and taking classes because it’s a burden on me as well. C is an emotional support animal for me so he is calm and easy to deal with. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying he needs to find a way to take K with him once he’s back from Europe, even if that means not moving back in with his parents?\n",

She was fun and I knew from that time she already struggled with anxiety to the point of not being able to do some tests out of nervousness, but it was getting worse each year.\n\nWhen school ended we both went to college we kept hanging out. We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\n\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoyed. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\n\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew her she wasn't well, but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \"I don't want to be your friend anymore\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\n\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\n\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\n\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness. I didn't lose lose any other friend because of this, but I'm sure they lost any admiration they ever had for me.\n\nAt the time I felt I really needed to do it but now I can't justify this behavior anymore.",

Gray and Blue are apparently close now, to the point where Gray goes off unhinged whenever Blue is upset in any way.\n\nOver the course of the summer, my friendship had been deteriorating with Blue and Gray slowly.

No one ever went out of the way to tell me something was wrong, and instead waited until the next day to tell me. I felt ashamed and disrespected because of it.

I agreed to drive him because I just wanted to get out of the situation and he was making me feel guilty. \n\nLater that night, he asked if I was sure I could drive him. I again told him that it was incredibly early and I’d be losing an hour of sleep—which is a lot, IMO when you already wake up at 5:30 AM. I didn’t want t drive him, but I sensed that he was still bitter and this was going to be a “thing” for him. I told him “let’s see what I feel like in the morning”, meaning that if I was too exhausted he would drive himself or take an Uber. He agreed to this. \n\nMind you he also knew that I hadn’t slept well the past 2 days either due to work and a little get-together on NYE. \n\nI woke up with him this morning at 4:30. I asked if he could call an Uber or drive himself because I tossed and turned last night and slept a total of 3.5 hours. He immediately started getting upset saying it was too late (he had 20 minutes until he had to leave—plenty of time to call an Uber). \n\nI gave up. He’d surely argue with me the entire time until he left and I’d be awake anyway, so I drove him. \n\nNow...to put my work schedule into perspective: I work 13 hour shifts. I’m on my feet all day long with little time to sit and also do some manual labor as part of my job. I get one 30 minute break at work. I’m a nurse, so I have to be clear-minded and able to think critically throughout the day. I am scheduled to work 3 days in a row like this...the first being the day he needed to be drive to the airport.\n\nI just got off the phone with him and he’s insisting that part of being in a relationship means that you sacrifice and do things like this for each other and I’m being unreasonable and selfish. \n\nI think *he* was being childish and selfish. I’m still mad about how he seemed to have manipulated me into driving him. \n\nAm I an asshole?",

They have massive self-worth issues, self-harms, drinks beer all the time, falls in and out of toxic relationships, and is, quite honestly, selfish. They never listen, and they never want to.\n\nI’ve yelled at Luke over text multiple times about what they do. When they wanted to get back with their ex, I basically said “Fine, go be destructive, I don’t care anymore, but don’t come crying to us when it doesn’t work out.” I’ve constantly told them that I don’t care because I’m just so emotionally exhausted from dealing with them. I mean, why should I bother or care?\n\nThe scary thing is that Luke’s been constantly saying that they’re going to commit suicide this year. And I mean CONSTANTLY. Every few days it’s been brought up, and in a kind of way that’s like “ha ha I only have a few months to live anyway lol”\n\nWe’re all worried about them, but it just feels...manipulative, at this point.

I did break his heart after all and I know he would be understandably sad and angry at me and I should let him.

O would always make sure to emphasize that she didn't fear X.\n\nOne night, we were having a bonfire and drinks when X pulled in. O jumped in his car for a \"talk\" in the driveway. As X pulled off and drove away O came back crying.\n\nX was acting crazy again and made threats. O downplayed it with her usual excuses for X. At this point, we already knew we were shitty friends for allowing this to go on in the first place. \n\nAbout an hour, the party had mostly broken up and it was just O, me and 2 others. X pulled up and O got in as usual. Then, O gets out of the car angrily yelling at X.\n\nAs it intensified, me and the two other 2 all agreed we should call 911.\n\nI have never called 911 before so we were shocked when two cops came running up out of nowhere and handcuffed both of them. \n\nBy this point, other friends came outside. O was still in handcuffs so I told the cops I called bc of X but they were both in violation and both arrested. O hurled insults at me as they took her away.\n\nO suffered some serious consequences. The cops found some illegal pill or something so charged her for drugs too. O lost a really good job. And had kids at home to support. \n\nI saw O the next day and she said sorry and i did the right thing but i never saw her again.\n\nI reached out a few weeks ago with a new phone number. When she asked who I was I told her and didn't get a response. I sent a few texts in the following weeks letting her know I miss her. A few nights ago, she finally responded.\n\nShe made small talk for awhile asking what I was doing and saying she was home alone and had been drinking. O then asked me to send a pic. I'm a guy so I responded with \"of what?\"\n\nMe being a homebody, O has seen me look my worst before, so I took a quick selfie and sent it with a sarcastic caption about how sexy I am.\n\nHer response: \nO: Uhh... wtf. I thought u were someone else.  \nO: Ur an ass!\nO: U called the cops on me. \nO: Fuck off\nMe: Ok but why?\nO: U were a great friend..b4 u called the cops!\nO: Goodbye \nMe: I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.\nShe has never responded. \n\nAnyone can claim that I was NTA due to an NC order and abuse in the first place. But it isn't so cut and dry. O didn't want an NC but by law it was auto. ",

I left the Christian faith after being kicked out of a church (and eventually getting my family kicked out) for being transgender. I am not open about this detail in my public life, but I am open that I do have a boyfriend, but my next most private thing is my religious belief.\n\nRecently at my convenience store work in a conservative Christian part of town, I’ve had a lot of people come up to me and try to ask me if I’ve heard the word of God. I tell them yes in some cases, but I left it for a personal reason, and then I get barraged with “Once you’re saved, you are always saved!” until I mention to them in the Bible that it actually says the one Unforgiveable sin is denying the Christian god and Jesus, and suddenly they tell me their life story and how much God has done for them, derailing the topic.\n\nThere are some instances where I just have to say “yeah I’m a Christian” so I don’t get lectured at work, or wherever I go in town. It’s pretty frequent I get asked this as the hours I work coincide with the services of 3 churches within a half mile of where I work. I’ve finally been able to tell certain people that on the clock, I have no religious or political opinion, but now when I come to my work casually, or in the area, it’s a lot harder to escape the question with regulars from my work who know that I am not a Christian.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I start telling people I’m not interested in their beliefs and told them kindly to mind their own business? I know a part of me is hugely afraid of rejection and what other people think of me, especially since I’ve already faced a mass community rejection once. I don’t want people in my life to know my business but I feel like an asshole for lying. I just wish I could have my belief without people trying to just change me. I don’t try to convert people and I love everyone for who they are and their walks, I just wish the same hand would be given to me.\n\nTLDR; I want people to stop trying to convert me to being a Christian after I faced mass rejection, but I feel like I would be an asshole if I told them to stop and that I’m not interested in their religion. \n\nAITA?

At the start of the relationship  (the first year was very difficult) it was really bad. With her, as a woman in her twenties, constantly needing to ask for permission to do basically anything.\n\n\n\nIt has improved a lot, with her becoming much more assertive and independent but one things still really bothering me. At the point when we had been living together around for around 7 months her parents  (who were in a longstanding legal battle with the US government over their citizenship rights) heard that the next hearing was going ahead and assumed they would win the case within that month,  despite me, my girlfriend, the lawyer,  and their oldest son trying to explain that this was only one step in a long process.\n\n\n\nWith this they decided they would spend their time before moving back to the USA  seeing the sights in Europe.  The problem was that they drained my girlfriends bank account to do it. (It was an account she made as a minor so her mom had access)\n\nWhen it came out that they won the case but another date was scheduled they exploded and blamed the lawyer and said it was his fault my girlfriends life savings were now non existent. \n\n\nAs I've said, over time she has gotten a lot more assertive and in return her parents have started treating her more like an adult. \n\n\nNow we're left being solely reliant on my income and savings and it honestly makes me furious.\nAny time I bring it up with her she says \"it doesn't matter\" and any time I voice my concern over feeling like I'm the only one putting resources into this relationship she blames her parents. But has not and refuses to ask her parents for the money.\n\n\nI know they aren't in the best position financially but it feels like I'm the one paying for it. Especially when at Christmas or birthdays she's lucky to get cheap low quality  clothes and socks, but her younger sibling (aged 21) who still lives at home is bought new phones/consoles and games even when it's not a special occasion.\nWith the excuse being \"well he works with your dad this is how we pay him\" even though he gets paid by their dad for the work he does. (Interesting side note: they pulled him out of school to start help working and now he's too old to finish high school and has no qualifications)\n\n\nSo, knowing that her parents are genuinely not in a good place financially, but they don't manage their money well, am I the asshole for wanting my girlfriend to demand the money from her parents because we shouldn't pay for their mistakes?\n\n\nWhenever we talk about it it always ends with me feeling terrible and just assuming I'm the asshole, but am I the asshole? \n\n\nAnd am I the asshole for expecting her to carry some of the financial burdens?",

I have never gotten along with our mutual parent as I personally feel they’re a hypocritical pile of shit and a terrible excuse for a parent.

They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would.

We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. The oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal ICU 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.

The friend in question is K.\n\nI met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating.\n\nThey saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals.\n\nBreakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours.\n\nOne of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing.\n\nAbout 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out.\n\nI had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y.\n\nI see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week).\n\nI think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway).\n\nA couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns. \n\nI'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care...

She decided that she doesn't want to throw away (???) the idea and the art after she completes the task, and wants to make a game. Us three have agreed to team up and work together. Now, this is important: during the initial meetup, L said things like \"this is **my** project\" and \"**I** have the rights for this idea\". I explicitly said that since this is her project, she will be responsible for the workflow and design, and I will only code and build. This will be a good practice for her, and the game is very simple, so this shouldn't be a big problem. We all agreed on that.\n\nI'm not going to go into the details, I'll just say that it's a simple mobile game. I also want to clarify that the basic workflow of making a game is as follows: take the idea you want to work on, make a game design document, make a prototype, refine, test, deploy (repeat 4 and 5 if necessary). It is generally considered a bad practice to freestyle things and work on later stages before the earlier stages. E.g. you make the music and high-quality models for the game, and then end up not using anything because the game gets reworked six times in prototyping.\n\nSo the next thing I talk about on this meeting is the GDD and the importance of making design choices in the beginning. I also mention multiple times that I, as a person who builds everything, need to know what needs to be done and how it should look/feel/work before I start working on the prototype. I ask her if she can compile everything into a single document as she did before, and advice her to use google and ask her teachers if she struggles with something.\n\nThis spring, L was making a project for her university entrance exam. The task was to basically design a game. This is important since she was capable of making a design document and other necessary things to show off and describe a game idea, therefore she knows what to do and how to do it. She periodically asked for help, and I helped where I could, without getting too involved, since this was her exam, not mine. Before that, I helped other people with their projects and ideas, all for free (there is a certain tendency here).\n\nThis time, I expected to be able to finally work as a part of the team. Not to do everything myself, not babysit everyone, just do my part and make a game. Oh boy. Was I ever as fucking wrong as this time. I mean, what can be easier than writing a few pages explaining the basic ideas? Core and meta, how to monetize, how should the menu look, what SFX and VFX we might need. The answer is, many things, but making a design document is not the most difficult part of making a game. Mind that is is also not final, you can and have to make changes to the GDD, but it's oh so difficult to work without it.\n\nWe \"started\" two months ago. L tried to make me write this thing a few times, and I kept sending her to google things and/or ask her teachers. She also kept feeding me with small, random, unstructured blobs of information, maybe hoping that I will compile them myself. I was close to doing this myself a few times but kept reminding myself that this time, I'm not the designer, she is the designer. Therefore, I was patiently waiting for her to write a three-page document. For two months. Last week I received two paragraphs with no useful info and replied that this isn't enough.\n\nI might have skipped a few details, I hope that it's nothing important, if you need clarification - please comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now the real story finally begins.**\n\nThis part will be biased since I'm still rather angry. I'm honestly trying to be objective, but it's hard.\n\nAfter our last dialogue, I was afk for a few days. I had stuff to do, personal stuff, and I honestly think I have a right to do my stuff whenever I want to. So, I return, power on the station, and get quite a shitpost from L *in our work chat,* that is supposed to be used for concept art, file sharing, and discussion. Anyways.\n\nI come back, and send her one of my own old design documents *as an example*. Why should I even do this, literally google this, please, it takes 3 minutes, and you have a whole faculty full of gamedevs! L responds, saying that it's my fault that she couldn't use google for two months, because \"if only I sent her the file a week ago she would've done everything earlier\". And she just keeps on fucking going on about how \"nobody is doing anything\" and \"you only do the code while I do everything else\" and \"it's such a shame that my amazing idea is getting lost because of you all\", and the best one is \"you are not helping me do my job\". I get it, you're a student, but I'm not supposed to teach you how to make games. I agreed to work for free. I think this is kind of enough of an investment.\n\nRegarding the code and stuff, it's a valid point, kind of. But we agreed on this initially, didn't we? Like, not taking into the account that code+build is 50% of the job, so it's a bit impolite to say this anyway.\n\nAnd here comes the fun part. She says, \"this is OUR game, it will only be MY game when I finish studying\". I'm honestly kind of taken aback by this. So, like, it's your game while it's easy, and then suddenly it's our game? What is this, some sort of conditional communism? Flip the switch and you're the boss, flip again and it's our job? So I'm confused and I ask her to calm down and tell her that if this load is too difficult for her, it might be a bad idea to continue studying/working in this field since it's only downhill from here (speaking from personal experience).\n\nNow, my opinion is that this is bullcrap. You can't call yourself the boss and then just shrug it off as soon as you have to do something. You also can't really say that you don't want to be the boss but keep talking shit. So I breathe in, breathe out, and logically explain to her that this is just workflow. You can't expect to get things done if you don't do them properly, and I have told her on multiple occasions what is the correct approach to this task. That I understand that this is difficult, that she also has to study, and maybe it wasn't the best idea to make a game at this point in time. If writing a small document is so difficult, maybe it's just not your thing, right? Fucken, wrong.\n\nAnd the shitstorm begins. If previously, the shit was just dripping from the ceiling fan, now the pipes of shit have burst full and wide, and the pressure is beyond imaginable. It's like Nurgle himself has arrived in our chat. \"You are lazy. You are a cunt. You don't do your job. You are not helping me. Oh, I'm just a beginner, and *this* is your motivational speech for me. Oh, I was hoping that you would do everything for me. You are acting so smug and grown up, why don't you guide me.\" You get the point.\n\nShould I spend my own time teaching and guiding a (basically) random person, because I know how to? Should I do L's job for her? Should I maybe do everything for her? Should I wipe her ass every time she takes a shit? Greatest minds of millennia still don't have answers to these questions. Keep in mind, M isn't really saying anything in this situation, and I understand that he is kind of between a rock and a hard place, and I don't blame him. I also want to point out that I haven't dropped the project yet, and I'm still waiting for the bloody design document.\n\nI personally feel like I should rush and help, as I always do, \"Take the wheel, Kuro!\" But I am so fucking tired. I help my friends and family because they are friends and family. I help my other half because she is my light and shadow. But I'm not there like a robot to complete requests from random people on a daily basis. I used to be stuck in this trap for a long time, doing things other people didn't want to do themselves, just because I can. Now I find it toxic, and I think it impairs personal growth and development in others. Am I the asshole?\n\nI might have missed things, but the general story is here. The post turned out to be twice as long as I expected it to be. I also might be completely wrong in my opinion that you're not supposed to talk shit to your coworkers, especially if they are working for free. I raise my glass to all of you who have finished reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** A person decided to jump over their head, I refused to do their work, got shit-talked and advised them to change the field of study, while it's not too late.",

All that lame girl shit: planning to be each other’s maids of honors, etc.) into a city she’s been living in for a while. It’s been pretty lonely, I’m not sure how to make new friends.. Jan’s really busy, working the work week and having extensive plans during the weekends with friends, keeping up with hobbies, etc. I was always excited to see jan when she came home, trying to squeeze in a few moments to chat or maybe watch something together. We’re both pretty “silly” people and so I thought we had a running bit about me play-annoying her. She loves the frozen franchise so I would knock on her door and sing the do you want to build a snowman song.\n\nI have a chronic pain disorder, so I warned her that when I moved in I might keep to myself more than she’d expect. Which I do. But she’s maybe in our apartment for an hour or two a day when she’s not asleep or has her door closed doing other things, etc, and she is my only true person to really see in person to hang out with. So, the other night, I was trying to chat with her about her day while she folded laundry in our kitchen and she said “remember when you said you were gonna keep to yourself mostly laughter I was looking forward to that.” And I said “I’m ... sorry?” And Jan replied “well I’m just trying to get some laundry done and here you are...” And I stepped back from the situation and apologized for bothering her while she was trying to get something done, because she was right. If she only has a bit of time to accomplish task while she’s home, it’s unfair of me to try and monopolize it for myself. It’s no fault of hers that I’m having a difficult time trying to make some new friends. I told her I’d be better at leaving her alone, and went into my room for the night.\n\nI miss her, but I decided not to bother her so I haven’t. I’ve really only seen her when she sought out to see me. \n\nWe’re from the same hometown, and she left earlier this week to visit her family for Thanksgiving. We had a rather awkward exchange about it this week, as she has complained rather frequently about going home for the holidays because of her extended family not being her favorite company. My birthday is around the holiday, so for the last two years we’ve spent thanksgiving together, so she kept mentioning that she hasn’t seen them in a while because of me, so she was going to go anyway. After weeks of this, on Tuesday I asked her to please stop complaining about going home to me, because my Thanksgiving plans included working many long hard hours (work in a Bakery) up until the day, and then going home at about 1 pm to be in an empty apartment by myself. She replied “well, you could have asked me to stay back with you.” But I don’t really feel I could have. She told me she “always” planned on coming back on Saturday “just for your birthday.”\n\nMy birthday is on Saturday but I got off from work so i decided I take the train to our hometown tomorrow morning. she keeps texting me asking what my plans are. I’ve responded honestly, that I’d like to spend it with my parents and my brother, being with my dogs at home, and she’s welcome to join us, and to come over whenever if she’d like. I won’t really have gifts this year, and I don’t plan on making a big deal out of it. It’s just nice to have a weekend off from work. She’s acting as if I’m avoiding her or being rude, and not making a specific plan is inconvenient for her. I told her if she’s busy she can pick a time and maybe a place for lunch or something and I’ll meet her there. This only seemed to upset her more? My birthday was never a big discussion point before the laundry debacle. I think I’ve just made her feel guilty, which wasn’t my goal and I’ve told her that multiple times. But I don’t know if my behavior reflects that. \n\nTl;dr: my friend told me I’ve been bothering her. I apologized, and stepped back. She’s upset that I don’t have a lot of interest in making specific plans for my birthday, which I wouldn’t ... anyway.\n\nAITA?",

And other song titles like that.  A part of the reason we brokw up is because we barley talked anymore(we go to the same school). We both agreed we would be friends thought.\n\n      Since september of last year till a few days ago i have been ignoring my ex boyfriend because he doesnt text me, he said that everything was cool between us but to me there wasnt. I would tell him and he would say everything is fine, i would talk to him in the halls but he would ignore me and i would shoot him a text and he would just see it and not replay for hours later but i would see he had been online at or a few momments before. It hurt me because he knew a part of the reason we broke up was because of communication and than he would say everything is fine.\n  Anyway i would get ignored so i decided to give him a tast of his own medition by ignoring him at school and not texting him, i do this for a while and my friend told me that my ex was confused why i was ignoring him. Me and my ex talked about it and agreed everything was fine but the same thing would happen, i would get ignored so i would ignore back.\n     Anyway FF to a week ago, everything is a bit better now. I was eating lunch with my ex and our friend and my friend ask if i seen his art recently and i havnt (we are all artist and showing each other our art is a normal thing to do so i was hurt i didnt see any of his) and than he says to my friend \"oh hey wanna go to my house later\" and im in tears because 1) he knows i want to text him and he doesnt text me 2) im kinda sad we arent close anymore. My friend ask if im okay cause tears are kinda running down my eyes and my ex does nothing. \n     Ff yesterday i stopped ignoring my ex because i wanna be his friend and act like eveything is okay because i want to be friends again, am i an asshole for what i did?\n( also sorry i have bad punctuation and grammer/spelling)",

My birthday started nice but the further the day went the more depressed I got.

The mood was ruined completely around 10 when E just stared verbally ripping into J making her run into a different room. \n\nE explained her reason for it ( mainly it had been 3 weeks since they broke up, how dare J be 'cuddling' others in front of her, J wasn't of meant to come that night anyway, and Js aplogise for growing apart wasn't good enough) it was pretty tense and that's when someone from the other room (kat) came to get J a drink. And E forbid it! Saying J should only have coke becasue E didn't want her drinking. \n\nI left the room and headed to the other, stressed as hell. I explain to K and F that E won't let Kat bring J some rum, J gets mad and tries to go sort it out. We stop her and then Kat comes in and passes just the coke then goes to get E some crisp  BUT then J butts in to say E shouldnt be eatting if she's upset. \n\nIt was a shit show. Everyone was done\n\nLater Kat threw up, K and JD had to clean it up. F was staring off into space. E was still going on about J and J was staying away. \nWe got Kat home and tried to calm everyone down. At around 3 I left K and F to sleep and headed for the couch where I found E, JD and JDs girlfriend still going on about the drama. I had to be up at 10 for a train. JD and her girlfriend have their own room. Only E is sleeping in the living room with me. I told them calmly I need to sleep, I had a train but they just kept going on and on.\n\nAt least use the hall way. JD went to bed at 4am, now pissed off because her girlfriend was more interested in E than helping her get J on the floor so she could get into her bed. J slept on the floor. \n\nJDs girlfriend finally went to bed at 5am and I was livid. I turned off the light went to sleep and.... was woken up every hour by E sleep talking/crying. \n\nMorning comes and I go to get dressed but the room my bags in is locked because K had a lecture. Ok. He'll be back in an hour to open the door I can just catch the next train I think. \n\nF wakes up and opens it instead and the guy looks like hell. He didn't sleep well thanks to the stress.\nI get dressed and decide I'll get the 1:41 train.. that doesn't happen \n\nF gets dressed, K gets home. JD wakes up and E has been walking around for an hour. \n\nMe, F, and K clean while E does jack shit. J gets up and also doesnt help. I need to leave now to catch my train but neither K or F can help me get to the train station till everyone is ready to go and time is ticking on. \n\nI say at least 10 times that I need to leave. K and F also say the same but apparently YouTube is more important. \n\nFinally F decides I should get a taxi to the station and say my good byes. Still pretty pissed off I bring up that I would of preferred no drama and a good amount of sleep and E and J go \" dont look at use like that.\" In pure defence like I'm the one in the wrong so I tell them again that I very rarely have the time to go out which really upsets them and the others. I didn't say it in a cruel way all i said was \"I came here to relax and hang out not deal with more unneeded stress. I also really need to leave\"\n\nI got on the train at almost 4. I won't get home till 7. My mother is end stage COPD and needs me there. I promised id get home early. They all know this. \n\nI rang someone who couldn't make it to the party and told them why i angry and they said I should look at it from Es point of view more. \nWhen I told them it looked like it could of turned violent and I was worried for Js safety  I was told I shouldn't say that and I sound like a dick. \n\nAnd then on the train I messaged K and asked if anyone was upset with what I said, he told me yes and \n\"I think everyone was annoyed and just doesn't really want to talk about it maybe?\"  \n\nNow i feel like the asshole for being upset over everything. \n\nMaybe I really should of took E perspective into account more?

We've been married about 8 years. More importantly, I don't know what perspective is the healthiest to take on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: tonight, my wife (47), mother-in-law, son (5) and I (45) are getting ready to have dinner. Like the previous poster, I do enjoy cooking; I like to experiment and hate using recipes. Sometimes, I lose- big time, but usually, I can do a pretty good job of making something delicious and healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, about a year ago, my son (5yr) was diagnosed Celiac, and about 6 months after, I figured out that my 30 year gut problem is an IBS caused by onion, garlic, and all kinds of other foods containing fructans. Those foods containing gluten (a protein) also have these fructans (a sugar), so wheat, barley, rye- my son and I both get hit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think my problem goes beyond serious, explosive, burning, toilet discomfort for a couple days, but my son truly will have problems if he ingests more than a sugar packet's worth of gluten in a year (put your knife in peanut butter, wipe it on your 'regular' bread, go back to the peanut butter jar with the knife, guess what's now in the peanut butter- whatever kind of bread you spread it on next).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about my son's celiac, I cleaned the house of gluten. Anything remotely suspect, I put in boxes intending to give away. Wife came home; within an hour most everything was back on the shelves. Perhaps I over-reacted, I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 8 months. We now often just prepare three meals for dinner. My son, being five, well he'd likely get his own meal in any case, not just because the gluten thing, but also, he's five.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife though, she insists on buying both regular and gluten-free, well just about everything.  So, we have gluten, and gluten-free peanut butter, gluten and gluten-free butter, gluten and gluten-free breads. Still gotta use the same toaster and all though. She made pizzas the other day using her bread-maker. One gluten-free pizza for the boy and I, a 'regular' one for her and our guests. Using the same bread-maker she'd been using for years. A sugar packet's worth of the gluten molecule, remember. But maybe I'm over-reacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway- things are settling to where I cook meals and my wife does dishes/cleanup (I hate dishes- hate it- and I do it 'wrong' anyway too often). She'll still make meals occasionally too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my wife has a thing with beef- I can't pin down her reason though, because it often changes. For years, the reason was that cows produce methane, take up too many resources, bad for environment, etc. But then I pointed out her milk drinking habit, and the fact that there were more buffalo in North America before the slaughter than there are cows now, and that they share a similar physiology, etc. So now her reason seems to have switched to that it 'makes her feel bad'. Though I still hear the environmental piece from time to time. She has no problem with other meats- birds, pigs, fish, not much a fan of lamb or goat though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she'll eat the beef pot pies her mother makes. And she'll eat beef other times at her parents' house, or at other's houses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, I go to make dinner for myself, my wife and my mother-in-law.  I decided to season some ground bison (having this onion/garlic thing, I've got to create all my own seasonings from scratch- EVERY seasoning mix has onion or garlic powder). Then I put it over rice and made a tomato-cucumber-corn salsa to put over top of that (because, again- I defy you to go find a salsa without onions or garlic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's good- it's really, really good. But my wife won't have any of it. Because I used the bison ground beef. She said last time she tried it, she had too much and it made her feel bad.  So instead, we just get in each other's way in our cramped kitchen while she prepares an entirely different meal using nothing I had prepared tonight except the rice. The meal she decided to have was my leftover veal-tomato-sweet potato crock pot disaster that I don't intend to have another bite of myself, I'm so disappointed with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, when the meal was over, my mother-in-law said, 'Thanks, that was good.'. And I said, 'Thanks, I'm glad somebody enjoyed it.\" My wife said, \"You didn't like it?\" I said, \"No, it was great!\".  She again said something about how last time she tried the bison she, 'Didn't feel good'. Then she proceeds to take another bite of the vegetables she'd picked out of the crock pot veal leftovers. Knowing full well that veal is cow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of behavior, is regular. When she makes me salads with the bitter, yucky plant leaves I just don't like, I eat them. I might complain a little, but I don't just make my own meal instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo folks, AITA for sitting here feeling bad because I live in a family that has to have three separate meals on a regular basis? Is this any different than the previous poster's situation with his fiance? Should I do more to cater to her choices of food items, when my son and I have diagnosed medical problems associated with foods that she refuses to adapt her own eating and grocery habits to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease ask for clarifications if you need them- I'm not looking for validation here- I really don't know if I'm an asshole or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Wife prefers not to eat beef. I make family meals and will use bison or beef (usually bison if I can find it) maybe once a week or every other week, but my wife won't eat it and just makes her own meal instead. My son and I have diagnosed/medical food issues, but she brings the offending foods home anyway. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We would still hang out a lot but it wasn't like the time we've been hanging out at school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into lots of arguments, as most of people in friendships do, which is very normal to me. I always approached him with what I didn't like and vice versa. The problem here is that I was always trying my best to not hurt him and avoid the things that would annoy him. He wouldn't do the same for me. He would try to provoke me every now and then even though he knew that certain things hurt me. I confronted him with this and he said that he's sorry and that he would stop it. He didn't. I learned to ignore it so it was fine after a while.  \n\n\nHe told me, that he really wanted to try weed at one point. I said that it's his decision but I advised him to thoroughly consider trying it in first place but also be careful where to get it from. So, one day he would invite 2 friends he met on the internet via online gaming to a sleepover LAN party. I got invited but I didn't really want to go at that point. So at the day, I was with another friend and he said 'How's Brian doing and I said that he was fine. He really wanted to see Brian so we called and asked if it was fine when we joined and he said he'd love us to come over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrive there and he's wasted af. The other 2 guys are listening to music VERY loudly while he is there lying on the couch looking really horrible. I'm concerned about him and ask what happened. He tells me that he tried weed and he feels miserable. After finding out that he hadn't eaten anything that day I decide to go to the kitchen and cook something for him as the other guys seemingly don't care. After that, I tell him to rest and the other guys to be quieter so that he can rest. We haven't talked about this day ever since, he didn't even say thanks for being there for me or anything like that.  \n\n\nOne day, I asked him about doing sports together. He is a good looking, athletic guy while I am overweight and have anxiety issues. I told him that it would boost my motivation if he went to the gym with me. He said that he didn't like gyms that much and didn't want to go. That was completely fine by me as I can't force anyone into anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, we would meet with 2 other guys (also met via online gaming) and have a nice time together. One of them proceeds to ask Brian if he wanted to join them doing sports at the gym and Brian immediately says yes. I'm obviously a little confused because our conversation about gyms was not that long ago. He looks me in the eye while agreeing and doesn't even ask me if I wanted to join as well. I'm really hurt but manage to forget it.  \n\n\nRecently, I asked him about something I wanted to buy and he told me that he knows someone who would get discounts and that he could ask them if I want. I agree. After one week of messaging him and him leaving my messages on read but not answering I decide to tell him that I don't want the discount anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really pissed because of the fact that all the time it was me trying to keep the friendship alive and to maintain contact. He would never message me on his own. All the times I confronted him with things that go wrong he would always reply with the same things, almost like a playback. I felt replaced.  \n\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I decided that I would act like him and not contact him anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole because I can't take this shit anymore and don't want to be hurt anymore?",

I’ve been playing it with my boyfriend since 2011 and it’s essentially been the backbone of our relationship and we’ve been together for over 10 years. I have countless great memories of me and him playing this game together, and I’d be playing it with him right now if I could. I moved out on my own for the first time a year ago, and it means I do not have any spare money, and certainly not enough to ever be able to afford a new laptop in the near future at all in order to play. As I’m typing this I hear the propane delivery truck outside and I already know there’s a 200$ bill stuck to my door. Since over a year since I’ve been able to play there been tons of new updates and whatnot, and I miss the game badly but there’s not really anything I can do. \n\nMe and my boyfriend have been playing Xbox games together since I do have a functioning Xbox. He has a functioning computer unlike myself so he technically can play the game i miss, but he doesn’t without me, and he doesn’t talk about it because there’s no point. We simply just have to wait however many years it takes for me to be financially secure enough in able to afford a gaming laptop ( or just one of any kind ) and he’s patient and nice about it. My best friend also use to play this game with me, and recently she decided to reinstall the game and play. I have no problem with that, all I did was simply as her if she could not talk about it with me as it saddens me I can’t play anymore, but she’s decided to be rude and sarcastic about it, taking my request in the wrong way. Specifically, I asked her the first time to please not talk about it as it upsets me. She decided she didn’t care and continued, so I got angry and was more stern this time. Now she’s being sarcastic about it and calling it “the game which should not be mentioned” to be a dick.... \n\nTLDR: I asked my friend not to rub in my face I can’t play a game and haven’t been able to in years, and she doesn’t care and keeps mentioning it.

I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn’t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie’s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn’t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie’s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for £350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn’t afford it Stephanie’s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back £60 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The £350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have £350, I do not have £60 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back £55 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don’t buy clothes, I don’t go out for dinners, I don’t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can’t afford the hen do, and that I just didn’t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or “sell a limb” to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was “being negative” that I would “upset her mum who offered to pay to be nice” and that I’m “ruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl”\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra £60 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can’t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I’ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I’ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can’t afford it and I’m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don’t want to hurt my finances but I don’t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend.

I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n",

            "input": "I guess like everything a little backstory and context helps. I have been with my wife for 3 years now I love my wife, she is with out a doubt \"the one\". \n\nShe has a group of friends that she grew up with and went to middle and high school with and she still has remained good friends with a lot of them. I think they are a wonderful group of people and generally everytime we get together it's a great time. They are a very welcoming and hospitable group and I had no problem falling in on friendly terms with a lot of them. The majority are over/out for dinner monthly.\n\nI have slowly started to notice that almost everytime we get together a subject (almost always jokingly brought up) is another one of our friends ( let's call him Jeff ) who has a, as some have referred to it \" the biggest dick they have ever seen\" \"not big, like freakishly huge\" \"you have your regular virginity, then your Jeff virginity\" type of endowment. \n\nThat being said it just seems like everyone in this group has some kinda fetish-worship about this guy and his hog, like I mentioned before, the jokes and stories they all share about different times they themselves have had sex with Jeff, or times they walked in on Jeff having sex with someone. I pointed this out to my wife after dinner Saturday about the cult like worship and her response was. \" I mean it is freakishly huge *laughs*\"\n\nMy problem with a lot of this is more complex than the way that everyone seems to obsessively talk about this guys hog. Some of it stems from the fact that my wife had a \"FWB\" relationship with him for a few years. ( 10 years ago, long before I ever met her) A lot of it I feel comes from the fact that everyone is comfortable OPENLY discussing this man's sex life.\nMaybe this is where I start to sound prude or like a baby but I don't openly discuss the kinds of kink my wife and I are into. I feel like everyone just being so nonchalant about discussing the first time they saw Jeff naked or the first time they saw Jeff fucking some random chick at a party is just.... too much\n\nThe whole thing just feels weird to me, with all of the different factors adding up, sometimes it just makes me reluctant to even agree to go out to dinner because at the end of the night regardless of where we go or what we do at some point this subject is going to be brought up and yet again I'm going to be forced to either confront the idea that my wife had sex with this guy for years or ignore it.\n\nI have tried to talk to my wife about it but at the end of the day, if the tables got turned I don't see any of it happening much less being so accepted. I would be mortified and embarrassed to sit across the table from an ex girlfriend as everyone else traded stories about having/seeing her having sex.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAITA for slowly over time wanting to exclude myself from group plans with my wife and her circle because of the constant inappropriate joking subject matter about her ex-bf/fwb's massive endowment",

I decided to work at this place because a couple of my friends worked there, this turned out to be a mistake on my part. I have social anxiety, which I have struggled with for years. I wouldn't say that it's severe, as I can have conversations and blend in relatively well without making any situation too awkward. However, I am terrible at starting convos and keeping them going. I often find myself at a loss for words, or I feel like it has run it's course. I am also prone to anxiety and panic attacks\n\nAs per most retail places where the goal is to selll, we had a quota to meet. As far as I know there was no real penalty for not meeting your quota, at least at this particular location, because I was never called out for it, and neither was anybody else. Nobody seemed to really care. \n\nIt would seem that my inability to keep conversations going hindered my sales goals. As I worked there for about three months and only met my goal four times. There were a few times where I barely missed it, but most of the time I made about 60 percent for the day on a four hour shift. I was very confused as to what to do most of the time, as I received conflicting information from my managers. Some of the managers wanted us to push ourselves onto the customer as much as possible, others wanted us to introduce ourselves and ask them if they needed help, and to let them do their own thing.\n\nSo one day, I'm just doing my thing and I make a sale after looking for a pair of shoes for about a minute or two, and afterwards one of the new managers, who we'll call Dave, pulled me aside and chastised me. Telling me that I need to get the merch out quicker, while also saying that my coworker who we'll call Victor, got shoes as quickly as twenty seconds.\n\nNow I think that was an unfair comparison, because at the time Victor was a manager and I was only working there for a month, he obviously knew the very large backroom better than I did. Next transaction, I bought out the shoes, made the sale, only to find out that Dave was timing me on his phone. He said it took me a minute to find the shoes and that it was too long of a time to take.\n\nAt this point my social anxiety started to take over and I was starting to have an anxiety attack. I went into the backroom so that no one would see and started hyperventilating. After collecting my thoughts, I went to Dave and told him politely but sternly that I was overwhelmed and that I wanted to quit. He told me to calm down and to not make any hasty decisions. \n\nI know it probably wasn't the best move to try and quit on the spot and I'm not proud of it in retrospect, but I still wasn't thinking too clearly at the time. He left me alone to do my job after this. AITA for putting him in a difficult situation and being unable to keep my composure in a professional environment?\n\n",

It was my birthday so we threw quite a big party, lots of people, booze, beer pong you name it. \n\nWhen we were out of booze, some of my flatmates suggested I could go to the liquor store 10 meters away from the flat to resupply. I was a bit taken aback by the request and calmly said I was reluctant (money wasn't and issue)\n\n They asked me why I didn't like this idea and I explained them: In the place i've been raised and in all the birthday parties I have attended (mines or friends), the person whose birthday it was didn't have to spend a single Euro on anything because it was entirely up to the guests to buy everything. (In a house party setting, if I was celebrating in a bar, I would pay for my own drinks unless a friend offered to pay me one.)\n\nThey basically told me, since they bought me the presents, I could at least contribute to the party in some way. I was flabbergasted by such an argument , thinking it was super rude to phrase it that way.\n\n There was a bit back and forth but since it was my birthday I didn't wanna make a fuss about it and act entitled so I just went to buy the beers (and it was freaking cheap anyway). I spent a wonderful night, got shitfaced, and got really nice presents from my friends so everything went well and all was forgotten quite fast. \n\nI wasn't sure if it was a cultural thing because one my fellow French flatmates agreed with the fact that you should also buy supplies on your own bday. Maybe it was the exchange student setting where even though it's  bday party, we organize it as a regular one anyway so everybody contributes, I dunno. Maybe you guys have the answer!\n\nSo, should I have been reluctant to buy booze on my own birthday party ? Did that make me TA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don't drive and my S/O does takes me to work on time, every day, about 30 minutes one way. \n\nI basically refuse to do any house work while I'm home or off, except for a few basic things like emptying the dish washer, vacuuming, taking out the kitty litter trash and cooking most nights. Everything else I just don't feel the need to do, since I'm gone about 6-9 hours a day. I do ask my S/O to do the chores since they don't have a job and are currently not looking for one. They are trying to get disability for mental health reasons, but basically sit at home and play video games or go hang with friends all day. I come home to a really messy house with dirty dishes basically every day. I then clean the pots I need to  use for dinner and cook for the both of us. I understand why its difficult for them to get started, but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with and some effort would be great to see.  \n\nMy S/O also has a habit of taking naps while I'm at work after staying up all night. I find this frustrating because I can't just take naps any time I want while I'm at work and feel tired all the time. I know this is a common symptom of mental illness and one I struggle with as well with my anxiety, but it also doesn't seem fair to me that I don't get to nap all day and come home exhausted mentally and physically all the time.\n\nI bring this up to them frequently and it always devolves into argument where I do get pretty extreme. Saying things like the time I'm at work they should be cleaning and not taking naps/playing video games ect. But honestly if they managed to clean and then decided to play video games after I wouldn't really care that much I guess. I also can go over board saying stuff like don't eat really good food without me. Like if someone is buying them food to save me some cause its not fair, since I'm not usually able to buy food like that on our restricted budget.\n\nTheir side of the argument usually revolves around how they have trouble being motivated due to mental illness and that if they weren't around I would have to go to work and do all the chores myself and expecting them to do it by themselves is basically just demanding a live in maid.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I work, my S/O doesn't.

Long flight, no sleep, and I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time so I was just sick and cramping. The photographer and his assistant knew all of this. I was bloated, and my wedding dress didnt fit me properly, so it was unzipped in the back and I had a wrap on to hide that fact so I was feeling pretty shitty about myself.

It's been a rough couple of days for my medical conditions so I took off a little early from work.  I got home and my wife was deep into her T.V. show.  Instead of bugging her, I went to take a nap, later got a snack, watched youtube videos for a while.  Eventually I mentioned to her that I wanted to talk about my new position.

Sorry for wanting to have a 15 min conversation with my fucking wife.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes and we've been sitting in silence since.  Am I the Asshole?

            "input": "Trying to accurately represent both sides here. So today is a national holiday where I live and my husband got the day off from work. This is special because a) I also work M-F and he works weekends, so it's rare we have a day off together; and b) our 7-month-old was sick recently and he was the one who stayed home with her for, so he hasn't had a day off in a month as he has been catching up since that time.\n\nSince it's a holiday and also my birthday tomorrow (but he'll have to work tomorrow), I wanted us to go out to lunch as a family. To exemplify how rare this happens, the last time we were able to all three go out together was in October. Yes, as in 2018. And *that* was our first family outing... so suffice it to say family time doesn't happen often and I want to take advantage of today.\n\nHe is refusing to go because he said he's tired from work, and has a toothache. Okay, so this is a legit toothache, but here's the thing. He has had problems with the tooth for a year. He does nothing about it (actually, he has to get it extracted and a whole bunch of dental work that we can't afford has to go along with that, so we're just waiting for the magical day we can save the money for that surgery until he can get the tooth out). \n\nSo while I understand that having a chronic toothache sucks, as does working all the time, I also think it's important to spend family time together. It's not like I'm asking him to take us on a huge excursion or anything. It's lunch. At a cheap café. Like, soups and coffee sort of deal. And he can't be bothered/tooth hurts too much.\n\nThis is the only thing I've asked for for my birthday, because we can't afford presents now that we have the baby and all. If we don't go today, who knows when the next time he'll have off will be. Could be months down the road before a day off for each of us coincides again on the same day and we can do something with our daughter.\n\nI should add that he is an *excellent* father - at home. He does more than his fair share of babycare, housework cleaning, etc... But it all stops at the door I take her to daycare and pick her up by myself M-F (b/c it's on the same side of town as my workplace), I take her to playdates, I take her to baby classes and the park and basically all of her socialization outside the house is just her and me alone, whether or not I'm tired from working all week, whether or not I'm sick or have a headache or something. It's like at home we're this great family unit but outside the house I'm a single mom.\n\nSo who's the asshole here? Am I being unreasonable for insisting he go to lunch as a bday present to me (and to spend time with his wife and kid) even though he's understandably tired, and has a legit toothache? Or is he making a mountain out of this toothy molehill?",

            "input": "Ok this one is a little complicated but I've tried my best to explain it. \n\nI've been seeing this girl for a couple months now so I know her pretty well but not completely. Basically, my girlfriend at this point but we haven't made it official. \n\nI'm back home visiting my family so the other day, I sent her a picture of me and my cousins hangin out, expecting her to say something like \"aw that's a cute pic\". But she proceeds to nitpick something about the picture, the details of which are not important to the story. I was a bit annoyed saying these little details she's nitpicking on aren't important, just focus on me and my cousins. This wasn't such a big deal to me, these things happen. \n\nHowever, she said she did say it was a cute pic. So I scrolled up thinking I missed her comment but I saw no such message. I took a screenshot of her non-message and sent it to her. I was expecting her to send a screenshot as well with her message but she didn't. So I asked her to send a screenshot of her message cause I just had to see it for myself. I know it's not really trusting of me to ask that instead of just taking her word for it but that's what I did. She ignores it completely and keeps on with the convo. I asked her again about the screenshot and this time, she seems or acts confused. I told her I asked for a screenshot and she said that she didn't get that message and sent me a screenshot with that message missing. At this point, alarm bells are going off in my head. Is it possible that she deleted the message I sent asking for the screenshot, took a screenshot after that and sent it to me? How is it possible that two very convenient crucial messages didn't go through? One supposedly that she sent that didn't go through (her saying it was a cute pic) and another one that I sent asking for the screenshot. By the way, the message that I sent asking for the screenshot is showing up as 'Seen' so she MUST have seen it right? \n\nI called her out on this and she was shocked and completely plead ignorance. She said her phone's been acting up and that I should believe her over a phone. I should also say that I'm overseas and my internet connection is not very fast. I pressed her a bit more about sending me a screenshot of her initial message and she finally sent it to me. The message that she said she sent (cute pic) wasn't in it. And then she said that's probably because it didn't go through or that maybe she typed it out and didn't actually press send, which sounded like complete bs to me. So after a back and forth of asking her to admit it and her not admitting it and sticking to her story, we're pretty much at a stalemate and still fighting about it. I know it sounds like I'm the one being petty here but the evidence against her is there. I don't put anything past anybody and I feel like people are capable of anything. I had an ex, for example, who would log into my fb account and look at my messages. It might not be fair to compare this girl to that ex but I can't help but operate on my history. Part of me wants to believe her but there is clearly another much bigger part that simply can't let this go. AITA?",

Recently it’s escalated and became obvious that they’ve liked each other for a while. They’ve been flirting more and it’s on a sexual side now. \n\nOne thing he said was “so you can be my sub and I can be your dom, that makes you mine”. He said this at like the beginning of them starting to flirt more sexually, so it was still new for them. She said “okay but if I’m yours does that mean I’m only yours? because if it does than that has to mean you’re only mine” Basically implying that they’d be exclusive or she doesn’t want a relationship with him, sexual or not. \n\nThen, he said “that’s where it gets tricky”. So of course she was upset thinking he didn’t even want a relationship. The next day he explains that he has more subs and she wouldn’t be the only one.. he said some manipulative stuff making her believe she would still be the most special one. I don’t doubt he said that to all of the other girls. \n\nFast for award to today, he tells her this: \n\n “Well I'm polyamorous idk if that makes any difference to you but I feel like why cant I make more than one person happy or satisfied  and i just simply feel like I would want to do that with you because it would make me even happier. And because of that the absolutely worst thing and what I definitely dont want is to hurt you so this is why communication with me is super important Idk how I would be able to explain that more but I'm not saying I feel like something is missing from my other sub it's just that I want to have you as a sub that's happy with the way things are. Idkkkk how I could exaplain it in a way that makes sense and its driving me nuts” \n\nTo me, it looks really manipulative and like he’s guilty tripping her into being okay with it. I brought that up and she said she doesn’t know what she wants. I told her how it sounds like he’s trying to justify having more than one girl at once. Especially since he doesn’t REALLY expect them to be all together at once, he really just wants to be able to talk to all of them  at the same time and the girls don’t have contact with each other. He says he wants 3-4 girls. \n\nThe reason I’m questioning my friend is because a few days earlier she told me she really liked him and might want a relationship with him, and how she doesn’t want him to be talking to other girls. \n\nBut now it seems like he’s been slowly incorporating this idea into their conversations and making her think this is what she wants. \n\nMy friend and I have been best friends since 2012. She’s been completely honest with me about this situation with him and even she is getting a feeling that it’s sketchy. But, she’s been getting defensive because she’s liked him for a while and doesn’t want to accept that he’s doing this. \n\nSo AITA for trying to make her see that he’s bullshitting her?  AITA for assuming he’s not being honest? ",

I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn’t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out.

Now I don't know if this has to do anything with it, but I was a rough child. my mum had to give up a job, as she had to constantly go to the kindergarden or school, whenever I misbehaved (fighting and doing dumb shit). I got diagnosed with ADHD and my mum decided to resort to medicine (I don't blame her). It worked out and I behaved well. Fast forward a bit and I'm 14. We're on a vacation to see my dads parents who I haven't seen in 12 years (so never really). My dad was also there at that time with his new daughter, about 5 years old. I really liked her as she's been the kind of little sister I've always wanted. My little sister was never on good terms with me, dunno why tbh. \nFast forward 2 days and we're still there. A stupid family arguement breaks out with two sides. The agressive A-Holes including my father and his bitch sister who claimed that my cousin punched her son (she didn't) and the ones that wanted to talk, including all of my family, my cousin, my grandparents and some other cousins. My dad goes to attack one of the male cousins with a pipe which he blocks. fight ends as soon as my dads older brother arrives. He tells us to leave for our own safety (in a kind way, gave us money for a hotel) and apologised for his siblings behaviour. This incident was the last time I saw my dad. \n\nI also need to add, that I am still playing piano and if it wasnt for me learning the piano, I wouldn't have got to known the most amazing person I've ever met, who made my life so much more joyable. I know that she would've wanted me to meet up with my dad as well. I'm grateful to my dad that he gave me this gift.\n\nNow here comes the thing:\nMy mother has been badmouthing my dad forever, and tbh most of those things I would say sound like things he'd do. But I don't hold grudges against people, as life is simply to short for that. My mother on the other hand still hates him and I understand. \nHe contacted me and my sister in November 2018, if we wanted to meet up every two weeks again. My sister instantly said no. I don't blame her, She barely got to know this man, only a few times and he just jelled and had a pipe in his hand. I on the other hand agreed. Now I do have the right to see my dad and my mother or anyone else can't do anything against it. She got pissed at me for saying yes, calling me a \"betrayer\" (haven't heard that for the first time) and saying \"do you know what I had to go through, do you know how much therapy I needed to get past his abuse?\"\nWell I said no but I still wanted to see him. \nWe somehow ended the arguement and left it open. My dad contacted me last week, saying he wanted to meet me. How'd he get my number? I didn't care. All I cared about was if he's the real guy. So I asked a couple of questions which he got right. He told me his wife got a second child after the first one and they want to meet their big brother. Now, he did contact my sister but she instantly blocked him. I didn't tell my mum. Instead I told we'd meet at a café and I'd bring along a friend. Time comes and we're at the meeting and talking about how things are. He invites us to his place and we meet the girls. They are lovely and I love both of them. The wife is also very kind and caring. I left with a positive attitude.\nI went home and told my mum that \"oh yeah, today I met up with dad\"\nshe just asked \" what do you mean\" so I told hee the same thing I just told you guys. Shw gets furious, screaming at me that she told me not to do it and even if, I needed her permission. \nThe incident spread throughout the family in an hour and I got threats from different family members. One said he'd take away my laptop, console and piano (all things I paid for with my part time job money) to which I replied he can go ahead, as I wont back down about meeting him regularily. He took the laptop and the console. well I wanted to go to the police about it but my mum said she'd not file a complaint (I needed parental confirmation or some shit like wtf) \nThe piano stayed as my mum convinced her brother/my uncle to stop it).\nI'm in this situation where I don't know what to do. \nI understand my mothers worried actions, but she needs to understand how I feel too (which is always last priority in this family).\n\nAITA, does ESH or is NTA?",

I had a dentist apt at 2.30 at home and I was gonna get the bus to college after that apt and me and my gf were free all morning (she had work at 4), so she went into the city to do some shopping and I met up with her in there. We were together for 30 min which she spent shopping for clothes (it was her only chance to do some shopping) and I had just bought a pizza slice and say down with her when she said she had to go meet her friend to buy her friend some clothes for the event they're both going to, and gave me a few kisses and left. I was pretty annoyed that she just got up and left because imo she didn't have to meet up with her friend at all she just chose her friend over me. She says she's not superwoman but I don't think I'm unreasonable for expecting my gf to spend more time with me. AITA?",

It being a higher level class that doesn't always take attendance, many people decide not to show up to class, so there are often empty seats around me. However, I always sit next to my friend and there is always someone sitting in front of me.\n\nAn assignment for the class is to write an Op-Ed, basically a short opinionated article. As part of the assignment, everyone in the class was randomly assigned two others to peer review their article.\n\nOf the two I was assigned, one was pretty good. They had a few grammatical errors and their points were a little confusing at times, but overall decent. I also didn't know too much about their topic to begin with.\n\nThe second one I reviewed was a train wreck at best. There were so many grammatical errors that I couldn't even read through the paper once without having to make corrections. Their sentence structure was so bad that I had to stop and try to parce out what it was supposed to say. I also knew a lot about this topic since I had written a paper on it a semester ago. They had the basic idea about the topic, but they left out a huge part of it that was really important to their point they were making.  All of that I left in my review that had my name attached to it online, but I didn't know who the person really was.\n\nAs class was ending the other day, my friend and I's conversation drifted to the Op-Eds that we had reviewed as people were packing up to leave. It turns out that he had looked at the first one I reviewed for fun and he had liked it as well. The other one he reviewed had some issues, but was ok overall. I told him about the topic that my second reviewed Op-Ed was about and what the person had left out. I reffered to the grammatical errors and bad sentence structure as a \"hot mess\" as I complained.\n\nI started to hear someone near me saying \"hey\" to get my attention and I looked up at the person who sat right in front of me. They informed me that I was talking about their paper and then walked away. My friend and I got real quiet and he gave me a 'you really screwed up now' face. I said that I stand by what I said, since basically all the things I mentioned were in my review online that had my name attached to it anyway.\n\nNow I'm not sure if I should feel bad about trash talking someone's paper and them calling me out for it.",

Here's where the problem starts, my mom is doing this event thing and she wants my friend to come over to our place for a bit so she can take pictures. I think this is a great idea i'll get to show her my room and stuff but she says it'll be awkward. It wasn't a no but I was feeling pretty mad at it and i asked her what she meant by awkward and she said \"well i've never been there and there might not be enough things to do and stuff\" and my mom got upset too she was talking to me about it and she said \"I don't get it, why can you come over and have fun but the moment you mention even slightly coming over to YOUR house she doesn't even have to think to say no?\" of course my mom was exaggerating but i kinda felt the same way. My mom lives in an apartment building, she owns a hair shop and is going to get a house soon but for now the salon and her kids are her priorities right now. Am i an asshole for being upset? ",
