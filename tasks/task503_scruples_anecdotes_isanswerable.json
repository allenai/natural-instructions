            "input": "I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \n\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \n\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\n\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\n\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \n\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\n\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\n\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \n\nThanks in advance.",

One day she excitingly texted me about how she bought a \"really cute sundress\" with sunflowers on it. \n\nFlash forward to this past Sunday, when she wore that dress. It was a very flattering dress on her, but it wasn't overly sexual. It covered up everything that needed to be covered up and it went down to her knees. She told me that her dad made some really rude remarks about how short the dress was before they went to church. Saying that it showed too much up top and down low.\n\nAfter church she texted me extremely upset because apparently someone complained to her parents that her dress was too short. Her father went as far to say that some of the comments he heard made him feel \u201cembarrassed.\" She said that basically the entire way home, they scolded her for how short her dress was.\n\nI told her it was bullshit. That she could wear whatever she wanted to. That she shouldn\u2019t be shamed for what she wore and that her parents were wrong for getting embarrassed about those \"comments\" and that whoever complained to them was a \"f\\*cking idiot\" so on and so forth. I even went as far as calling her parents inappropriate names. I used a lot of words I really should not have said, but these comments really upset me. I have a sister and know that if someone ever commented negatively on her outfit, it would really trouble her.\n\nLast night, I got a text from said friend reading \"well this is discouraging\u201d and then a long text basically saying \"She is 16 and can not wear whatever she feels like if it is revealing. Modesty and purity are extremely important to us and and I am extremely disappointed in this whole conversation.\" Her mother took her phone, read our messages, and texted me on her phone.\n\nI was taken back, and didn't want to cause anymore drama so I just told her that I was sorry and was trying to stand up for her.\n\nShe responded with another long text saying how she wants to protect her from \"pervs and anyone else that would want to take advantage of someone so pretty and awesome\" and then said that her and I would speak more later.\n\nI've been struggling with this all day because I've had friends tell me IWTA because I overstepped my bounds by telling her that she could wear whatever she wanted and that people were idiotic to complain about it. I know I used language I shouldn't but I was just infuriated at the whole situation.",

Today is Valentine\u2019s Day and my husband (29M) and I (22F) typically just do something really small like dinner and small candy gifts. \n\nMy husband has a history of not getting me any gift at all for things (Christmas, my birthday, our anniversary etc.) because he typically forgets. Sometimes he\u2019ll get me something retroactively, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t. An important detail is that our birthdays, Valentine\u2019s Day, and our anniversary all fall around the same time of year so it is kind of a lot all at once. \n\nThis year we were talking about our birthdays and I said \u201cdon\u2019t bother getting me anything.\u201d He argued that he would like to get me something so I said \u201cI want you to make me a nice dinner.\u201d (This is something I have asked him to do for the last 4 holidays and it still hasn\u2019t happened.) He said he would do that. Then I asked about Valentine\u2019s Day and he said \u201cWe\u2019re definitely doing something.\u201d \n\nToday, I arranged to have a bakery make a small personal sized cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and a chocolate heart for him. I got off work an hour early and came home to surprise him with it. He stayed home from work today because he is recovering from a fever and cough, but he was 90% better today and went out for errands. He wasn\u2019t home when I got home, which was strange so I tried calling him. He didn\u2019t answer, so I waited about 15 minutes and called again with a follow up text. No answer. I started to get really worried and called another 3 times in a row and still no answer. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later he calls me back and says \u201cI was getting a haircut, but I\u2019m coming home now. Is everything okay?\u201d I said yes and see you soon. \n\nI thought he would be bringing something back for me for Valentine\u2019s Day. But he came home empty handed, and seemed genuinely surprised that I got him something. I then expressed that I was a little hurt that he didn\u2019t get me anything and his response was \u201cWell, I had planned to get something on the way home but then you called me so many times I thought you were mad I wasn\u2019t home so I just came straight here.\u201d \n\nTo me that feels like a BS excuse and he forgot to get me something. I clearly told him on the phone that everything was good and I was just worried about him not answering for so long. I feel like he\u2019s trying to flip it on me, like it\u2019s my fault he couldn\u2019t get me a gift. \n\nSo I took the chocolate covered strawberries for myself and I\u2019ve been kind of snippy with him tonight when he asks me what I want to do. \n\nAITA for being upset that he didn\u2019t get me a Valentine\u2019s Day gift?

I must have been 17 at the time, and I'm 29 now, but sometimes when I try to go to sleep this situation still bothers me. \n\nFlashback to when I was about 17, a friend I knew middle school sent me a message on Myspace, or something like that. She had moved about 8 hours away, but said she was coming back to my home town for a little bit and wanted to hook up. Nearly all of her messages were sexual from the start. Being single, I figured \"why not\". We dated for a few weeks in middle school, but I figured we were past that since it was kid shit anyway. Given her approach, I figured it was going to be a no-strings-attached kind of thing, since she was just visiting.\n\nShe gets here, we meet up and hook up for a couple nights. I tell her I was kinda dumb for breaking up with her in middle school, since that decision was mostly made based on the opinions of my friends at the time. I was in no way saying I wanted a relationship with her then, just kind of reflecting on how stupid I was when I was 13. \n\nSo messages me on AIM when she's supposed to go back to where she lived. She asks me where we are at, and I just say,\"What do you mean? You're going back to (place where she lives) and I'm gonna be here. I thought you just wanted to hook up, and I don't wanna be in a long distance relationship.\"\n\nIt's kinda hazey, but I think she said she was moving back to my home town and was expecting that we would be together based on the fact that we hooked up. I told her it was a misunderstanding, and that I didn't wanna be in a relationship, and then I get mutual friends calling me and saying she's crying and that I'm an asshole.\n\nIf you ask me, she tried to manipulate me into being in a relationship with her, but I still kinda feel like an asshole.",

She was complaining about how her current girlfriend was out getting high, and L was sure she was cheating on her.\n\nWhen I offered comfort, she exploded on me. Saying I ruined her love life and that I was horrible to her constantly. I felt disgusted by it for a week before I told K, and he let it simmer until I claimed it really bothered me, instantaneously deleting all of her hate and banning her.\n\nShe attempted to shoot me a friend request in October, in which I politely told her to screw off.\n\nLooking back on old messages, I don't think I'm in the wrong.

However, all of our mutual servers are now dead and gone, so there's no way I can retrieve anything from there.\n\nIs it really my fault or did she just overreact?\n\nTL;DR - Girl I was into turned out to be into me, calls me a bitch when I date someone else even though \"I knew\" about her being into me.",

Over the summer my friend was at her annual army training for a month, away from her boyfriend, this has never been a problem for them because it would be her second time doing this while they were together, not to mention her leaving once a month to go on drill. Anyway she comes back and they begin having some relationship problems, mostly about what they want to do with their lives, I should also point out he is nearly 4 years older than her (almost 25 now). He has his life set and a career in front of him and she wants a career in the army which could send her basically anywhere in the world.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and they \u201cbreak up\u201d for the first time, so to take her mind off of it we decided to go out with a group of friends for some drinks, she planned to sleep on the couch at my house and her boyfriend did not like that fact (I am a guy and he has never been a fan of me). So when she left that was when they \u201cbroke up\u201d. When we were out and she got some drinks in her it was like she never even was dating him, let alone the fact that they were together not hours earlier, but she was just all over any guy that would give her attention, especially other guys in ROTC with her.\n\nThis cycle continues a couple more times and one day when I was home over the summer she texted me saying she wanted to hook up with me and that she has wanted to for a while now, she was of course, absolutely wasted, and complaining that her boyfriend doesn\u2019t pay any attention to her like she needs it. I texted her that she is going to regret what she is saying in the morning and she did. Then I get a call from her saying that she had gone home and slept with a bartender from that night and that she didn\u2019t know what to do or how to explain anything to her boyfriend. This is when I tell her she has to be up front with him about it and take whatever he does on the chin or just break up with him.\n\nShe opts for neither and decides to not tell him anything for a while. I let it slide because I knew she was trying to figure some stuff out about her future. But then she started hooking up with the lieutenant that was in charge of her at school. For those that don\u2019t know thing about the military this is a BIG no no. this went on for a while and it started to really irritate me because she would be late to meet ups with myself and other friends because she was \u201cbusy\u201d with this guy. During this time, her and her boyfriend were going through a rough patch but they weren\u2019t officially broken up yet. Eventually I confronted her about the whole thing and told her she was jeopardizing her future by doing this and a fling when you\u2019re this young isn\u2019t worth risking your career.\n\nShe takes my advice and afterwards it seems like she is going to cut things off with her boyfriend officially and just be done\u2026 until he came to her house crying one night because he missed her, and she bought the whole thing. I will point out she did tell him she had been talking to other guys during their rough spot but he didn\u2019t care that she had been \u201ctalking\u201d to other dudes.\n\nEventually I hit a breaking point, people had recently been not up front with me about important things and I didn\u2019t think what she was doing to him was at all fair, so I told him, \u201cI know you\u2019re not my biggest fan but I am not one of the guys that she hooked up with\u201d. This of course started a shitstorm of epic proportions, my friend even tried messaging the girl I had recently ended things with asking if she wanted to do \u201cmean shit\u201d to get back at me.\n\nI dint feel bad for what I did because if I were the guy I would want to know the truth about what is going on, plus from my point it was a generally unhealthy relationship on both sides (I really think he is just staying with her because he wants to be engaged with someone in less than a year) so big question, am I the asshole for doing what I did and exposing my best friend to her boyfriend?",

My husband has proposed a ban on all the older shows and movies, but I think that\u2019s a bit silly, especially since she likes to watch them, and I think it\u2019s a kind of teachable moment. I think it\u2019s better to have conversations with her about the content than to just eliminate it entirely. Writing this out feels kind of dumb, but my husband is legitimately pissed at me, so am I the asshole?",

She takes hard classes, is a double major, and is upset with anything below an A on her work. She'd usually spend a few more hours doing homework than I would, and was usually the best student in class. We lived together for a few years before I got married and moved away. However, we still talk frequently and hang out online as we're both gamers. The problem is that because of her schoolwork, we hang out once or twice a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand school is important to her. She picked a hard field and has been selected for a couple of great opportunities such as being a lab assistant and a few internships. I'm really happy she's enjoying her university life and doing what she wants to do. My problem is with her time management. She often talks about how busy she is and how she has no time to hang out or talk. However she often goes out of the way to make her work take longer than it needs to. For example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) She often does homework while watching tv. Even if we had the same assignment, she would still take 2 hours more to do it for the same grade, because she'd get distracted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Opting into extra assignments she doesn't need or want. She had 2 internships and then signed up for 2 more, when she was already stressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) When writing a paper with a set limit, She will write over the limit and then spend the next few DAYS cutting it down to the required length. When I say 'over the limit' I'm talking writing 13 pages on a 2 page assignment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3 is what our most recent disagreement was about. I understand everyone has their own method, and I know people write over the limit and then edit it to the length it needs to be. But writing THAT much more is insane. I asked her why bother writing it that way if it was just making more work for her for no benefit, and she freaked out and started yelling at me saying that shes sick of people calling her a \"tryhard\" and that this is just the way she does it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got irritated that she was snapping at me when I wasn't trying to attack her. I told her that if that's how she wants to do it, fine. No one can tell her how to get her shit done. But also don't complain about being overwhelmed when a 2 hr paper is instead taking you 3 days because \"that's how you've always done it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know we see school work differently and I don't know if I'm just an asshole, or if she's being unreasonable and is going out of her way to make things difficult for herself and then expecting her friends to listen to her complain about the work she made, all while not spending time with us or talking to any of us more than a few times a month. I love her and shes my best friend, and at this point it's something I've accepted will be part of our relationship. I'm just wondering...AITA?",

She\u2019s blond, kind of short and good looking, she\u2019s a bit nerdy and the type to say sorry to a fly after she squashed it she has the \u201ccute girl next door\u201d look.\n\n**Mark:** My friend. He\u2019s tall has dark hair and glasses, he\u2019s very funny a bit dorky but one of my very best friends. He\u2019s a country boy and usually dresses more practically then anything else.\n\n**Michael:** Me. I\u2019m blond, average height, pretty good looking (if I do say so myself) though rather skinny and usually wear a dress shirt and some nice pants.\n\n**Background:** \n\nFrey, Mark and I all started in the same class some years ago. Mark and I quickly became friends as we have the same kind of humour. The first time I talked to Fray was in German, we had to work in groups, Fray and I were paired. a bit later we got to catch up at a preparty and ended op kissing at most of the night at the party the day after I really didn\u2019t know what to text her as I had only been in one previous relationship, while I was pondering she ended up texting me a bit later we ended up discussing what we actually where, after being asked by almost all of the school, we came to the conclusion that she would like to be my girlfriend and I would very much like to be her boyfriend. \n\nJust before we began in school my little sister was diagnosed with cancer and she was in the hospital for over 9 months only coming home a handful of times. It really took a toll on me and I got kind of depressed thought I did my best to hide it from everyone, I hate talking about my problems and didn\u2019t want to make it even harder for my parents or my little brother if they also had to worry about me. Fray was exactly what I needed, finally something good happens to me. I don\u2019t know if it really played a role, but I thought I would include it just in case.\n\nThe relationship for the next long time went great, she loved me, and I loved her more then anything, until she ended it. I followed her to her bus almost every day (a 20-minute walk) there we could talk, complain about school, hold hands and I could get a goodbye kiss. One day she wouldn\u2019t hold my hand, she kept her hands in her pockets, I didn\u2019t think anything of it as it was cold. The day after that again she wouldn\u2019t hold my hand and I could the something was bothering her, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me what, when her bus came, I said \u201cgoodbye, I love you\u201d as I always did, her response? \u201cmmhhmm\u201d this broke my heart, it wasn\u2019t a big deal but damnit that hurt. The day after our school held a large party (the same kind that we hooked up at) and I hosted a preparty at my house for the class, she would avoid me the whole day I just drank some more and tried to have fun. When we got home to me after the party and went to bed, she would lie almost over the edge of the bed aka. As far away from me as possible. By this time, I had begun to see what was coming and just wishing she would just rip the bandage off and get it over with instead of this torture. The next morning, she said we had to talk and she broke up, she began crying so I did my best to comfort her while dying inside I send her on her way home and just sat thinking why she broke up, she never gave me a reason, so I felt I was something I had done or said but I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I had difficulty sleeping as I felt guilty because of whatever I had done, and it didn\u2019t help that I had to see her every day in school. Just to say the breakup was very hard on me, I still loved her, but I knew she didn\u2019t feel the same way anymore.\n\nTime went and I started getting over her. After a rather large party I hosted an after party for a small group of friends, Mark asks me if its okay he invites Fray, I couldn\u2019t see a reason she shouldn\u2019t be aloud to come so of course I say she could. Half an hour after she arrived her and Mark were not to be found anywhere, I had just emptied my last beer, so I headed down to my room to fetch my Gin for a Gin n\u2019 Tonic. Then I open my door the first thing I see is Fray and Mark in my bed, they weren\u2019t doing anything just lying side by side talking, I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just said hey got my liquor and went op to the others. I know I wasn\u2019t a lot, but it really got to me seeing my ex, with my best friend, in my bed, the same bed I used to be with her in. some days later another good friend told me he saw it too and asked what I thought about it.\n\nI noticed them beginning to talk each other more and more I school, I even felt happy for them both. \n\n**Now to the reason I write this in the first place.**\n\nsome time ago I got invited to a small house party by one of the girls in the class, she lives in the country and I in the middle of the city so it was a good bit away so I arrange with my mother that she would drive me home when I called, she was happy to do so but of course it would take some time. All the girls invited arrived a couple of hours before so they would have some girl time before the guys came, but as the only dude Mark was also invited to come early, I thought it was strange but maybe transport would be easier if he came early. When I arrive, I was greeted by everyone with a hug, apart from Mark and Frey as Fray had leached on to Marks arm, I give him a handshake and a pad on the shoulder. The party went smoothly and it was fun to let loose, talk and play drinking games with all the others. Most of the party leave early and take a taxi to the dance club, I can barely eat with a fork let alone dancing especially drunk, so I thought Id stay a bit see what happens and maybe call my mother soon. We ended up being only Mark, Fray, the girl who hosted the party and me. We sat in the sofa watching Die hard and eating leftover pizza from earlier and let me tell you Mark and Fray did not watch any of the movie, they were cuddled up exactly the way we always used to when \u201cwatching movies\u201d aka. Making out. This really fucking hurt! I called my mom and she came after like half an hour.\n\nIt might not true seeing I was drunk, but I swear se glanced at me all the time, I tried to ignore it as I didn\u2019t want to course any drama.\n\nThe day after I text Mark something like \u201cHey, listen I don\u2019t get to say who you can and can not be in a relationship with, but you have to see this from my angle and understand it isn\u2019t easy seeing my ex being together with my best friend. If you really like each other of course you should be allowed to, but damn it hurt watching you and Fray yesterday lying exactly as we used to. I think you deserve to know how I feel and I hope you respect me enough to have this in the back of the head when I am near\u201d he said he was happy I texted him and of course he would.\n\nSince this they slowly stopped talking as much as they did before, I don\u2019t know If I really did end their relationship before it started, however I feel like shit knowing it\u2019s a possibility, so I must ask am I the asshole in this situation? \n\n**TL-DR:**\n\nMy long-term girlfriend broke up with me and quickly after start baking on my friend, so I text him that it hurts seeing them together. Since I did, they haven\u2019t talked as much, AITA?",

In September he had a stroke and this exacerbated things with his health even more so. \nHe is currently bed bound un able to walk but still has his mind and wits about him, even though he\u2019s a little slower. \n\nWe always had a family plan and he paid for my grandmas phone bill also, but I always paid him for my portion. Through the years he\u2019s given me several small loans for things, and we had a book to keep track of it. I always paid it down and kept up to date with it. Closer to me taking over his finances and basically entire life, he wasn\u2019t tracking things as much or not really worried about me paying him right away or anything. \n\nI switched the phone account into my name so I could make necessary changes but kept the bill to his account. Since taking over I haven\u2019t paid it back in several months, but keep diligent track of all other transactions. \n\nI set him up on state disability, social security, take care of all his insurance issues, found him an assisted living place, and am currently getting his house ready to rent (insane amount of work) so he has more income coming in when disability runs out. I brought my roommates over to help clean out his house and took them out to dinner and paid with his card to say thanks.\n\nHere\u2019s the AITA part. I\u2019m doing all I can for my dad, and have his best interests in mind, but I also don\u2019t want to take advantage of the situation. He\u2019s absolutely fine on money and did a great job setting himself up for retirement, but I\u2019m also not trying to feel entitled because it\u2019s his money, not mine. I asked my mom about it and she said I shouldn\u2019t worry cause I\u2019ve already saved him a ton of money anyway and it\u2019s a \u201ccost of doing business\u201d type of thing. But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a bias with me being her kid. \n\nAdded info, mom and dad are separated but still good friends, also am an only child.\n\nTLDR: Haven\u2019t paid back my dad for phone bill, but have complete POA and am helping him out with his entire life.\n\nEdit: talked with him about it. Go figure, the simplest conclusion didn\u2019t cross my mind.\nHe said not to worry about it and to keep my conscience guilt free.",

He used to live in the south and his family and the people in his small town weren't very respectful or accepting of his gender identity/sexuality/general existence. I wasn't in a much better place financially, but after much begging and pleading on my part (he didn't want to move across the US to live in the Pacific Northwest initially because he'd never lived so far from home, which is understandable) he finally let me buy him a plane ticket to get to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe moved in with me in July of 2018, and I already had a job waiting for him when he got up here. Through no fault of his own, he was laid off a week later (the job had been for a temp agency in a volatile position that depended entirely upon the work load the company had, and the temp agency had hired too many people for what the job required). A couple of weeks later, he found another job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, we were living in a shitty little 1 bedroom apartment with a third roommate (J), who had approved of and helped with the decision to move A in with us, but J had made it clear he was moving out at the end of the lease. Come October, I'd been laid off from my job for the same reason as A (we'd been working in different departments at the same company), but found another job within a day of being laid off. He was working too, but was getting less and less hours. He eventually decided to quit...a week or so after we moved into our new apartment (this is important, as it sets a precedent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely managed to convince him to wait until he had another job lined up, because I would have had to pay all of our bills (which doesn't amount to as much as some people's I know) on not enough income. But it didn't matter anyway, because he ended up getting laid off from there too. Fast forward two and a half months, and he's finally gotten another job (after I've had to pull some shady shit to get our bills paid for which I already know I'm the asshole). I had to beg and plead with him to actually put in applications in the first place and I dragged him to the Subway he got a job at to put in his application. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Subway doesn't do 'full time' (40 hours a week minimum) for anyone who isn't management. Their 'full time' is no more than 30 hours a week, as it is dependent upon the company's policy what their definition of full time is. Minimum wage here isn't enough to survive on, as in most places, especially not if you're only making part time. I was ecstatic for him when he got a job, because the stress of having to pay all the bills and buy our groceries was killing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got an email from the recruiter of the temp agency I work for now that my site is hiring for 3 more positions in my department. I don't make amazing money here, but it's more than minimum wage and is guaranteed 40 hours a week. Not to mention that the only skill you need to have is the basic understanding of how to use a computer and talk on a headset, and it's temp to hire (hired on permanently after 90 days). I'd talked to A about this in the past about possibly getting a position here and he agreed that he would be interested. I told him about the position and he immediately said that he wouldn't do it because he'd just gotten hired on with Subway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had three separate conversations (read: arguments) with him about this, trying to get him to understand why I'm so anxious and upset about him taking this part time food service job over a full time temp to hire position that is so much more secure and has consistent hours. And he comes back at me saying that I need to stop bothering him about it and that it's starting to piss him off that I'm not respecting his decision. I'm frustrated beyond belief, and I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to make rent if he's not getting consistent hours. It's putting strain on our friendship, and I'm too much of a pushover (not a humblebrag, i'm the fucking worst about this) that I'll never be able to kick him out, especially since he literally has nowhere to go. He couldn't even get back home to the south if he wanted to because we have $0 in savings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLogically, I think I know I'm not the asshole in this situation, but I am constantly doubting myself about everything I say and do because I'm not a terribly confident person, and I'm anxious about everything and anything I do. Especially when it comes to roommates, as I've had pretty much this exact situation happen in the past. You'd think I'd learn, but that's where that pushover bit comes to bite me in the ass.

I decided to work at this place because a couple of my friends worked there, this turned out to be a mistake on my part. I have social anxiety, which I have struggled with for years. I wouldn't say that it's severe, as I can have conversations and blend in relatively well without making any situation too awkward. However, I am terrible at starting convos and keeping them going. I often find myself at a loss for words, or I feel like it has run it's course. I am also prone to anxiety and panic attacks\n\nAs per most retail places where the goal is to selll, we had a quota to meet. As far as I know there was no real penalty for not meeting your quota, at least at this particular location, because I was never called out for it, and neither was anybody else. Nobody seemed to really care. \n\nIt would seem that my inability to keep conversations going hindered my sales goals. As I worked there for about three months and only met my goal four times. There were a few times where I barely missed it, but most of the time I made about 60 percent for the day on a four hour shift. I was very confused as to what to do most of the time, as I received conflicting information from my managers. Some of the managers wanted us to push ourselves onto the customer as much as possible, others wanted us to introduce ourselves and ask them if they needed help, and to let them do their own thing.\n\nSo one day, I'm just doing my thing and I make a sale after looking for a pair of shoes for about a minute or two, and afterwards one of the new managers, who we'll call Dave, pulled me aside and chastised me. Telling me that I need to get the merch out quicker, while also saying that my coworker who we'll call Victor, got shoes as quickly as twenty seconds.\n\nNow I think that was an unfair comparison, because at the time Victor was a manager and I was only working there for a month, he obviously knew the very large backroom better than I did. Next transaction, I bought out the shoes, made the sale, only to find out that Dave was timing me on his phone. He said it took me a minute to find the shoes and that it was too long of a time to take.\n\nAt this point my social anxiety started to take over and I was starting to have an anxiety attack. I went into the backroom so that no one would see and started hyperventilating. After collecting my thoughts, I went to Dave and told him politely but sternly that I was overwhelmed and that I wanted to quit. He told me to calm down and to not make any hasty decisions. \n\nI know it probably wasn't the best move to try and quit on the spot and I'm not proud of it in retrospect, but I still wasn't thinking too clearly at the time. He left me alone to do my job after this. AITA for putting him in a difficult situation and being unable to keep my composure in a professional environment?\n\n",

I go inside, make my drink, grab my bag and head back out.

We are both 23 years old and we have always been good friends but I can't help feeling like I was a little *too* straight up with what I said to him. I went a little too far but I felt it needed to be said. Anyway, here we go.  \n\n\nSo this guy, I'll refer to him as Steven, doesn't have a job and isn't actively looking for one either. He gets money from his parents as a type of 'allowance' because they don't work either and get government money because of medical reasons. He basically lives in his room most days watching Twitch and makes videos on YouTube in his free time that basically only me and one of our other friends very occasionally watch. Fair enough, he has an interest and he enjoys doing it which is completely fine with me, but I always just lightly and in a peaceful manner remind him to keep it as a hobby and to keep an eye out for something to support himself and to which he agrees. Only he never does anything about it.  \n\n\nHe always tells me how he is having a hard time and he never has the money to do anything with, to which he never really tells me *why* he is always so short seeing he literally gets given money for doing nothing. He would always give me a vague reason but I always just believed him, he was my friend why would he lie to me I guess? However just this weekend it was finally revealed as to why, and this was how it happened.   \n\n\nOn Saturday me and Steven were hanging out so we went to the movies to see Overlord (which was fairly average really) but surprise surprise as we got to the ticket booth he was a little short on cash so I stumped up for his cinema ticket once again. I am mostly used to it at this point but for some reason on that particular day it really got to me how I have probably spent more on Steven than I have my own Mother over the years. After we got to our seats I asked him what happened to his money seeing he told me on Wednesday night his parents gave him his 'allowance' because there was no chance in hell it was already gone, it had been two days. I looked him dead in the eye and just waited for the response, to which he finally and rather sheepishly told me he has used it all by donating it to god damn Twitch streamers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally sat there for a good 10 minutes speechless. All this time I have been paying for this guy over so many years for anything we do has all been because he has literally given away any money he has ever had. Every single last penny. I finally after staring into thin air trying to comprehend what he has just told me asked him why? Apparently he would rather, and I quote, 'let them have it and not give it to big companies because they have enough money as it is'.   \n\n\nThat was the last straw for me. I knew I had to say something because I felt like he not only had been mooching off me for so long but also his parents. It all suddenly became so clear to me that the reason he never has money is because he *gives it away.* I presumed he was using it to buy things like groceries or I don't know, maybe to pay bills with, is that too much to presume? Thank god the room we were in was empty because I couldn't keep it in. I told him that all this time he has been wasting his money on complete strangers he doesn't even know, and has basically been coming up with excuses as to why he never had money. I told him right there and then that is the last time I'm ever paying for him again. He doesn't like to give his money to big companies but he gives it away to strangers? He is happy enough for me to use all of my money on him to give to these companies? No. Enough. I told him how stupid he has been getting his money for nothing and using the money that his parents have given to him and wasted it, money they could have used on themselves for things they actually need to get by. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was saying this something in me clicked again and this is where I feel I went a little too far, but I told him that he is never going to get by in life if he doesn't get his life together and get a job, quit making YouTube videos that no one ever watches apart from me that from now on I won't be. He needs to get a job and to stop living like an ignorant child. If he doesn't accept that he has to get on with life and live in the society of the current world he is going to be on the streets once his parents are gone. I know that last part was a little over the top, but I want him to realize this is no way to live, this isn't normal. If he continues on like this much longer he is going to have it hard for real. I see him completely differently now, and I feel like I don't want to be around him anymore. All this time I thought he was using his money to support himself, but no. He was wasting it and using both me and his parents. He got up and walked out, I haven't seen him or heard from him since. Frankly I don't want to.  \n\n\nTell me Reddit, am I the asshole?   \n\n\nTL;DR: A friend/now ex friend of mine was always short on money even though he gets it from his parents for doing nothing so I would always spot him some or pay for him. Find out after years of knowing him the real reason he never has money because he gives it all away to Twitch streamers. Tell him he has basically been using me and wasting his own money and what I think of it, end friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "I grew up poor in one of the shittiest cities in the US.  Despite that, I was always fed and always got gifts on Christmas.  I only recently learned that my mom was putting herself into debt to always make sure my little brother and I had plenty of presents.  I'm thankful for her generosity, but it needs to stop.  At this rate, she's going to die in debt.\n\nShe's always bought for all my cousins, too.  And since my first cousins are having more and more kids, the number of people she wants to buy for keeps increasing.  I've pleaded with her for the past few years to just not buy gifts, trying to convince her that holiday shopping is not obligatory, that the kids all have plenty of toys and games already, that my brother and I don't need anything, and that that money would be of so much more use going towards future expenses.  She never listens though...saying that she needs to because my first cousins have always bought gifts for my brother and I, and that it will make her happy to buy the gifts/sad to not buy the gifts.\n\nI should add that I'm 2.5 years out of college, and I have a decent job (65k+ in an area with relatively low cost of living).  Ever since getting this job, I've helped my mother financially as much as possible. She works at a school and doesn't get paid when the kids are on break, and I fully support her during those times.  I bought her a car and pay for all maintenance and sometimes gas.  I help her at random times when she won't be able to make ends meet in a given month. I've bought Christmas and birthday gifts, and I buy my brother things he wants and needs in her stead. I intend to pay off her credit cards over the coming few years.\n\nI could buy all the gifts, but I just don't think it's necessary,  especially when I'd rather put it toward helping my mom and doing things with the people I would be buying for.  I take my brother to concerts and I'm taking the oldest cousin-once-removed skydiving next year.  I'd rather do more things like that and buy gifts that matter at some point in the future than add to their piles of stuff. In my family, the Aunts and Uncles all buy the kids cheaper things, and their ideas for gifts come from the parents telling them \"so-and-so needs an xmas idea\" and passing whatever they said along. Call me a Grinch or Scrooge, but the gifts that come from that are meaningless.\n\nI write this as I wait for my mom to come over because she wants me to go Christmas shopping with her, and I'm incredibly frustrated.   If she didn't buy gifts this year, she could save that money for the next time she would need to \"borrow\" from me, meaning I could save what I set aside for her every month and could pay off her debt sooner.  But she just won't listen and sounds a bit like her heart is going to break if I wear her down. AITA for being so upset with her?\n\nTl;dr: My mom can't make ends meet without my help, but insists on buying a lot of Christmas gifts.  I want her to stop, but she's very emotional about it.  I'd rather help her with her debt than buy gifts in her stead.",

I'm one of the few who switches between morning and night shifts, as I'm trained for both routines. There's not a lot of people who work in the department, probably around 10 total. Because of this, usually someone will work until a certain time and then someone else comes in to take that person's place.\n\nNow, I have this one coworker I'll refer to as \\[REDACTED\\]. \\[REDACTED\\] is always late. Always. That's not an exaggeration. Every. Single. Shift. He runs from 15-30 minutes late. I'm not sure why. I would think if there's a problem that causes him to be late he would had fixed it by now so I'm just assuming he doesn't care. The only reason why he isn't fired yet is because he's one of the 3 people who knows how to close down the department fully and does it the best.\n\nAnyways, this Sunday I was working a whopping 11 hour shift from 5am-4pm because a good amount of staff are college students and are taking spring break off to go back home/see family/ect.  I wasn't super excited because that's 10 1/2 hours on my feet (only get one 30 minute break) and my longest shift I've ever worked in any of my jobs. I also have bad insomnia so a opening shift means probably 4 hours of sleep for me.\n\nAs the end of my shift was (thankfully) approaching, I ran over to the schedule to see who was taking over for me. It's \\[REDACTED\\].  A bit later it gets to 4pm (the time I was scheduled to leave) and to no one's surprise, \\[REDACTED\\]'s no where in sight. At this point my feet feel like they're withering away from the pain of being on my feet since 5 that morning and I'm seriously debating cutting off my feet as I'm sure that would hurt less than the state of my feet in that moment.\n\nAt roughly 4:20 (hehehehe) and STILL no sign of \\[REDACTED\\], I go over to one of my coworkers and say \"Fuck this, I'm leaving\". He starts to say something but I speedwalk toward the terminal and clock out, grab my jacket and backpack, and book it out of there, too emotionally and psychically exhausted to deal with anyone else.\n\n2 days later I come back into work and my coworker I talked to before practically running out of there was working.  He comes up to me and basically says what I did was a dick move and I need to wait for \\[REDACTED\\] or whoever's coming to replace me before leaving. I argued that I would normally wait but 1) I worked a 11 hour shift that day and 2) \\[REDACTED\\] is always late, and, to be frank, that's not my problem. He didn't have a comeback after that but was still pretty rude and blunt to me the rest of the shift, as well as another one of my coworkers who saw me rush out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I've been probably overthinking this and feel pretty guilty. But Reddit, AITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

When I first heard about the trip, I told my spouse I had planned on attending. The first thing they asked me was if plus ones were invited. I told them I wasn't sure, but I'd let them know when I found out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward three weeks later and I now know plus ones are invited. I just revoked my RSVP and I feel like I'm going to crush my spouse's feelings for doing so, since it seemed like they wanted to come on this trip (it was the first thing they brought up when I told them about the trip).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to attend the trip without my spouse if other SOs are invited, because my spouse may think I'm excluding them for bad reasons (e.g., they're going to think I don't want to hang out with them, or I want to be away from them, etc.). I went on an overnight trip with my coworkers from a previous company two years ago and my spouse was having some trust-issues regarding a certain coworker who I'm good friends with, and I don't want him to have these issues again with my new set of coworkers, so I'd rather just have none of us attend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thought-process / reasoning below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'd feel bad if my spouse took a spot that a coworker could have taken\\*\\*. I know, I know, other people are inviting their SOs so I shouldn't feel bad, but all of the other plus ones being invited are people that we (coworkers) know. They come out to our company's happy hours, holiday parties, etc. Even though I've been at the company longer than a lot of the people inviting their spouses, not many people coming on the trip have ever met my spouse. My spouse doesn't attend our events mainly due to noise-anxiety (tinnitus-related) &amp; the fact that we live a bit farther from the office than the others (30-40 minute drive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my spouse knew the rest of my coworkers, I would feel comfortable bringing them along. Yes, this would be a great opportunity for them to get to meet my coworkers, but it's also a trip with a limited number of spots. Our happy hours and events happen frequently, do not have a guest-capacity, and some (the monthly ones) are tolerable as far as noise-anxiety and loudness are concerned (according to my spouse).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'm also afraid of putting my spouse into an uncomfortable position regarding tinnitus and sleeping\\*\\*. This is less of a concern because my spouse is an adult and clearly if they knew there was a risk they wouldn't attend the trip, but I still can't help but worry a bit. My spouse struggles to sleep at night due to their tinnitus. They often sit in the kitchen with the faucet running in order to fall asleep. My spouse wouldn't have that option in a shared cabin with coworkers. They've struggled with sleeping on overnight trips in the past  and it would be difficult if they felt trapped on this overnight trip that's about 4 hours away from home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR- My spouse was looking forward to attending an overnight trip with myself, my coworkers, and their SOs.

Shit had hit the fan because last semester I joined a business fraternity where I had became friends with many people. Beforehand, my girlfriend had occupied so much of my time, we'd talk 6-8 hours a day and had led me losing any of my close friends. When the semester started, I loss touch with her, I became more involved with my fraternity and shit had hit the fan because she became jealous of other girls that I was getting to know (not flirting or anything, but becoming friends with), so as the semester ended we tried fixing my issues of lack of communication and openness. \n\nCue the end of December and my fraternity announces a retreat to Tahoe, to potentially party, have very fun moments and really develop bonds with other people in the fraternity I haven't got to know. It is on the same date that my girlfriend and I had originally planned to go on vacation together, and I was torn in between these two events. For one thing, I had never had gone on such a trip with friends and for another thing it's from what I hear something people in my fraternity won't forget. So I am allured to that idea. I feel like going on a trip with my girlfriend is so expensive FWIW (Each of us are looking at $500 which is not really wise for both of us who are in college, in comparison to $55, but I can't bring her). I also feel like there may be fights and horrible experiences just because are relationship is just pulling itself back together. In fact, we just started planning this 2 days ago when it should have been 1 month ago minimum. \n\nDeep inside I just wanted to have fun on a trip that I may not be able to experience again, and I was hoping my girl can trust me, but she can't because I had deleted a text to another girl saying Happy thanksgiving\" when I told my gf I wouldn't reply back. It seems crazy and childish, but a lot of trust was lost because I was replying to other girls texts before her. I wasn't trying to get with any of these girls, it just feels so great being friends with people. In other words, I've been in a controlling relationship and I just started having these experiences.",

I had to get up to go grab it. \n\nAte a few different kinds of meat and finished our side dishes. Server took forever to replace our side dishes (we had to ask). Took forever to refill my drink. After our 3rd plate of meat, we ordered one last plate. Server decided to bring a WHOLE plate and immediately threw it all on the grill.

I've been annoyed by how often my roommate rants about even the most slightly controversial things (she's always been doing this somewhat regularly but it's been daily since last week). For example, last night, my friends and I were watching a movie and there was a scene where a woman takes off her bra but her breasts weren't on-screen (the movie was rated PG-13) and she whined for a solid 5 minutes about how sexualized breasts are and that they should be revered as \"life-giving and sacred,\" then ended it with how bras are \"designed by men to oppose women/women should 'free their nipples.'\" She does this with other things she sees and reads about, and although she's entitled to her own opinion, I hate how out-of-the-blue and constant it is. Every time I try to counter her with an opposing opinion or become visibly irritated, everyone calls me rude. I just think they're overreacting. The fact that I'm never taken seriously since I don't talk and act like they do has bothered me since day one, but I kept my mouth shut about it since they're--apparently--good people. \nIt doesn't end here though because what really set me off was another one of my friends saying that everyone in Wisconsin is racist--and they all know that I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I then explained that from personal experience, that's not true, but they ignored me anyway. Overall, they claim to be accepting but treat me like I'm from another planet and aren't afraid to personally offend me when I'm right in front of them. I've been considering drifting away from them and making some other friends instead, yet I'm afraid to at the same time since I need to pick my roommate for sophomore year next month. Am I as inconsiderate as they say I am, or am I just a bad friend? \n",

Last night we were hanging out with some friends at my place and it was hitting 2am, so I wanted to go to sleep soon and started to wind down the get together.  My boyfriend insisted that I come back with him since his roommate wasn\u2019t there for the night, and I kind of didn\u2019t want to. He got visibly upset with me so I agreed to come back with him. He hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep the night before, so it was strange to me that he wanted to initiate sex being so tired. \n\nWe had some pretty great sex imo, but he wouldn\u2019t finish. I tapped out after 15 minutes and he dragged it on for longer, and then, out of the blue, he asks for anal. We had never done that before, and I wasn\u2019t even sure about how it felt nor was I mentally prepared. He had completely stopped what he was doing and kept insisting for it, so thinking that it might get him to finish sooner, I say yes, with a very clear boundary that if I said to stop, it meant we were stopping. I had read about it before hand so there was some preparation. \n\nHe was respectful throughout the whole thing, took it very slow, he said he was enjoying it a lot, but again, he wouldn\u2019t finish and I don\u2019t know why. He just kept going until I felt nauseous and told him to stop, I was out, I was exhausted and I couldn\u2019t continue any type of intercourse at this point. \n\nHe stopped, cleaned up, and was very upset because he didn\u2019t finish. I asked him why he wasn\u2019t able to finish and he said he was holding back cause he really wanted to keep going, but I find that extremely hard to believe, going on for a little over 45 minutes at this point. He asked for a blowjob and I tried that but he was just taking way too long, at this point I felt like he wasn\u2019t into me, nothing I did got him to finish and he ended up falling asleep very upset with me. I cried and I left on my own, and messaged him at 4am that I was hurt and didn\u2019t want to talk for a while. \n\nHe messaged me and I told him my thoughts and he said that I was being petty and if I wanted to feel sorry for myself then to take as long as I want. I feel humiliated, I feel like I\u2019m no good at sex and I\u2019m still hurt and upset.\n\nAm I over exaggerating my feelings?

            "input": "Okay, long story folks. They'll be a tl:dr at the end. Sorry for formatting, on mobile. \n\n\n   So here's some backstory, I (16m) come from a lower-middle class family in a suburban neighbourhood, but I am not exactly privileged when it comes to my family situation. I was a mistake child, as well as my brother (18m), and we were born into a family with a submissive pushover mother(50f) (she most likely has Stockholm Syndrome)  and an physically and mentally abusive father(55m).\n\n\n   I won't go into all the details about what me, my brother, and my mother have gone through, but here is the jist: Choking, beating, spanking (with fists), kicking, slamming against walls, getting punished to get at my mom, slamming glass, purposely keeping us up at night with loud music, burning our favourite toys, chasing me around with a needle... You get it, I don't have a very good father.\n\n    Furthermore, my mother earns more than my dad as a manager, yet does all the work around the house (laundry, cooking, cleaning, filling up gas in the cars, literally every chore). Yet, my dad works in labour, does jackshit around the house, and claims that he is the only one holding the family together.\n\n   So flashback almost exactly a year from now. I woke up at around 6am on the living room couch to my father yelling at my mother, and this was normal. So I got up, and I stood at the kitchen door kinda just watching them argue and yell at each other. Well, my mom starts walking down the hallway to their bedroom to pack her stuff and leave for her parents house. This is when my dad came up behind her and started trying to strangle her on their bed. She was on her back, and he was on top with his hands around her neck.\n\n   At that moment, after years of submission and built up anger against my \"father\" I broke, and went into a fullsprint jumping on to his back and began pounding his head in with my fist. I got a good 20 full force hits, and if it wasn't for my mom ripping me off of him I would've gouged his eyes out. After that, he realised \"oh shit I really fucked up\" and began saying how much he loves all of us and how he couldn't believe I'd do that to him, y'know, the standard narcissistic thing. Me, my mother, and my father were pretty much arguing about how awful of a person he is. I reminded him of all the awful things he has done and he would deny literally every. Single. Instance.\n\n   After a few days of tension, nothing really happened, but I decided to go into no-contract with him and no longer address him as my father, but by his name. He knew how I felt about him, I called him all the names he called us when we were kids right to his face (garbage waste of space, cunt, etc.) And going back to the beating, I rushed him so hard that when I kneed him in his back I broke a rib, and he was too embarrassed to go to the hospital. I hurt him so badly I caused him to lose his job and basically become disabled as he spends literally every waking hour in his bed playing World Of Warcraft in his bedroom. So that went quite well for a few months, until he, and my mother, began demanded that I give him respect.\n\n   They have (and still do) have this rule where I have to say goodnight and goodmorning everytime I wake up/go to bed. I didn't want to, or needed to talk to my father for obvious reasons. This pissed him off, because requoting him through my mother it \"made him feel like he was a piece of shit in the corner\" Which is funny, because that's exactly what he is. They threatened to punish me, and tried to force me to apologize to him. Fuck. That.\n\n   So after a few months of tension, my father gets pissed off at me for a irrelevant reason and we get into an argument. He bagan threatening me with violence, calling me a libtard, and said he was proud of choking my mother to the point of blacking out. I actually threatened him back, and he backed off. He realised he can't take on his 6'4 slightly muscular teenage son when he is at grandpa age and has troubles getting up to use the washroom. After he ranted for a bit more about the gays, libtards, and women that was the end of that ordeal. And since then I've continued to do the same, no contact. My only form of communication has been through him bitching about me to my mother.\n\n   Fast forward to today, and he is getting moody again. He wants me to say goodmorning/goodnight everyday. And I refuse. Here is the thing, my mother and my brother on his side. They say that he has \"changed\" in this past year, even after the decades of abuse. They say that I need to learn to forgive, and not be \"stuck up\" to my dad. I on the other hand want to go down with dignity when I get kicked out the day I turn 18, I want to make him feel like what he is. A piece of shit in the corner.\n\n\nTl:Dr - abused physically and mentally by father, father strangles mother, and I beat the shit out of my dad causing him to lose his job. I go into no contact with him, refuse to call him my father, and refuse to give him any respect. My family is against me saying I'm taking it too far.\n\nI'll provide more information if you really think you need it to decide if I'm in the right or wrong here. So,\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

I can't excuse myself though. I currently live much further away, I can't drive so it's a 4 hour train journey and I need to take a couple of days' holiday and arrange for cat care to get home, and my partner and his family, and my job which is going well and which I could progress in and would like to progress in are here. I'm 40; I have no, and can't have, children, I live alone with my cat but my partner and I are happy and very much in love as we are which is living separately (for irrelevant reasons). But, my dad passed a couple of months ago so my mum is now on her own in the seaside town we both grew up in. She's doing really well; she has a lot of friends, she's making a lot of good progress in terms of adapting her life, my sister can visit more regularly than I can and does so and also has her children who want to see their grandma. But, the town is dead- there is no work there, it is run-down and younger (than me, but it was the same when I was 18 or so) people have to leave to find better work; my friends I grew up with have all but left- there is nothing for me there, unless I took a job at a supermarket or something and tried to work up which would be in stark contrast to the job I have now in the city I live in, which is nearly management level but still ok-but-not-great-paid but the benefits are good.

But, my mum's on her own and it's difficult to get down to her as often as I'd like- the train fare is about 1/10 of what I earn a month, I need to take holiday to make (just the journey, I'm not meaning this in relation to seeing her) worth it otherwise I'm there and turning back round to go to the station, and I just keep thinking go home, go and live with her, don't leave her on her own... but, I also think she wouldn't want me to leave my job and be working minimum wage (I'm not exaggerating about that; there is NO decent, prospective work in the town I grew up in), and to not be with my boyfriend like I am now because I'm 40 and I don't want to start again with that and she really likes him and she knows we're happy together, and I now it's all relatively new because it's only been a couple of months since my dad passed and we're all still adjusting and it's probably too soon as my long-term family friend/uncle has advised me, to think about any big thing anyway, and I've only come back from seeing my mum today so I'm probably just feeling raw about it, but AITA for not thinking immediately and rightly- I should move back to my dead-end home town to be with my widowed mum?

I love my family, I don\u2019t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we\u2019d all get to be together. \n\nI did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.\n\nIt\u2019s getting closer to the date, so my sister\u2019s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she\u2019s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn\u2019t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.\n\nMy mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she \u201chas some concerns\u201d about doing that, since sister\u2019s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he\u2019s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. \n\nI sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out.

I'm currently a senior at a 4 year university and until recently I was living with my parents because it financially makes sense. It only takes me 30 minutes to make the drive to campus so I've been fine making the daily commute. Over winter break, a friend of mine invited me out to the bar for a few drinks. We've been friends for a good 4 years and he's also my old roommate freshman year. While we were having a good time and catching up he told me about his living situation. He told me how his parents pay for an apartment on campus but due to his grades not being so great, he had to move back home. His parents are Asian and super strict so that really didn't surprise me. After his parents forced him to move out they couldn't find anyone to sublease so they were stuck with an empty room. He then offered to let me move in for free since he can't live there. Thinking this was too good to be true I asked him if there was a catch. I was at least expecting to pay half rent or something but he said not to worry. Shocked by his generous offer I accepted. This was probably the kindest thing anyone's ever done and I was planning on doing something really nice for him over the summer. The next week I went to visit the place and met all of his roommates who were all super cool with me moving in. I then spent the next week packing and moving all my stuff over. It's been a month now and everything couldn't have been better until my friend who offered me the room texted me asking for rent money. I was a little taken aback by this and I really didn't know how to respond. I would have never agreed to move in if I had to pay rent because I simply can't afford it. Also I'm paying for my own tuition so I can't afford rent on top of my tuition payments. I would have just moved out but I already moved everything over. My bed, furniture, and clothes are all there. Also I canceled my university parking pass and spent money getting an apartment parking so if I move out I'm out a serious chunk of money since I have to buy my university pass again. I honestly think I shouldn't pay rent because he promised me I didn't have too. I'm going to tell him that I won't pay for anything. Is my roommate being an asshole for demanding rent after he promised that I could live there for free? Or was I just naive?",

Whenever I smell smoke wafting up into my suite I simply close my patio door or bedroom window and it prevents stinking up my suite.\n\nThe incident \nI was assembling IKEA furniture at 5PM. I hear a ton of banging on the floor. I adjust to work more quietly and finish entirely within 20 minutes. \n\nThe fallout \nThe next day I come home to a mild smell of cigarette smoke in the entrance to my apartment. I see an envelope on the floor under my doors mail slot, and when I pick it up it reeks of cigarette smoke. I open it and read a strongly word letter from the tenant downstairs, complaining of loud banging at 5PM the day before, threatening to contact the tenancy board and pursue further action of this nature. I put the letter in a zip lock to contain the smell. My apartment smells nice and my air freshener doesn\u2019t need competition. \n\nMy take \nThis dude is over sensitive to noise, irritable in general and gross. I wait on it a few days and think on how to respond.\n\nI decided:\n- I really don\u2019t want to interact with this person. It will be very very unpleasant between the predictable stink and the likelihood of a unpleasant exchange. \n- instead, after a week, I wrote a note to the landlord saying I normally ignore the eccentric irritability of the person downstairs but now that they are leaving stinky letters in my entrance I have to address it. \n- I included the stinky letter in the ziplock bag for the landlord to read and presumably smell.\n- I told the landlord I will be ignoring this tenant going forward as best I can. I also mentioned that my neighbour to my right has never complained of noise and even told me he likes living next to me because I\u2019m not loud or obnoxious and as a bonus I\u2019m not a smoker.\n- my call to action with the landlord was that he simply ask the tenant downstairs to be more tolerant of noise during daytime hours and to cease putting anything in my mail slot.\n\nJudge me \n\nAm I the asshole for:\n- avoiding the tenant downstairs entirely and just tattling to the landlord\n- avoiding conflict not because I\u2019m afraid but because I just genuinely think the tenant downstairs is stinky and passive aggressive and his letter gave me all the insight I needed on both.

I moved up two year levels from year 9 to year 11 (level one) and she moved up one year 10 to 11 in math 2 years ago, ahead of her, then she stopped competing over math, and at the end of last year dropped back a year to do calculus, as originally she'd gone into statistics (I was in calculus so we didn't worry about class over lap). All was good until this year I joked about visiting her physics class to confuse the teacher. She didn't know it was a joke, she wasn't listening fully, got really serious and said \"**Don't.**\" after I told her it was a joke she relaxed a bit and I laughed it off. She said it some more times over the next couple days about not doing physics, at that point I had no intention on doing it.\n\nRight now I'm in 13 calculus (level three) I'm ahead of the year 13's and working on my own thing, my year 12 calculus teacher came up one day said I should move into year 12 physics (level two), I dismissed it because of my sister but wanted to do it. The next day I had my second science lesson, the first one was boring. I found out it would be recap for at least half a term and probably more, I just felt constrained. I thought about moving up to level two physics and possibly level two chemistry. That evening on the way home I casually mentioned moving up in science, my mum was immediately hooked and started sorting out the details with me. Up until this point I hadn't seriously thought about moving up, just some maybes in my mind. My mum sorted out the class changes and I got moved up into the subjects (my mum is a teacher) and it turned out there's only one physics class and one chemistry class so I'm in two of her classes. I attended one physics lesson when my sister was sick and that's all I've had.\n\nToday I went with her to her job interview to calm her a bit she was thankful. When we got home, because I thought she would take it better when she was happy with me, I just out right told her. I didn't want to just show up one day in her class. Now she's furious with me and I don't know what to do. I don't want to make her sad, but I didn't do this to piss her off, so I'm kind of annoyed she got upset. Am I the Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My one year older sister really didn't want me to move into her science classes and told me repeatedly not to after I joked about it, but my classes weren't teaching me anything and I felt restrained with learning, so I did. I ended up with her in two classes, she's now furious and I don't know if I'm in the wrong.",

            "input": "On mobile, very sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo for context: I\u2019m -15- 16, I live with my mom and visit my dad every other weekend. This last year I\u2019ve had an increasingly tense relationship with my dad, I feel like he is being overbearing and he thinks I should be more responsible and social. He tends to say he wishes I would be more open and honest with him, but it\u2019s difficult since I can\u2019t argue my view as well as he can and usually end up feeling like shit. It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but I\u2019d prefer not to get into the specifics of our dynamic. He got me a MacBook last year for my birthday, but it didn\u2019t work and said he would replace it(but still hasn\u2019t). \n\nSo, my 16th birthday was last week, and this weekend I went to my dad\u2019s house to celebrate. On Friday, my dad had said he thought I would really like it. When I asked him if it was a new computer, he said I already have one, referring to the desktop that is not mine and I can only use for max four days out of a month. \n\nSo today was when I opened my presents and, still being an absolute child, was super excited to see what he had gotten me. Mind you, I figured it wasn\u2019t going to be a computer because of the chat we had had Friday. However, I was still extremely disappointed to see that I had received a Snuggie. And not just any Snuggie, but the same one (albeit with a different color) he had gotten me for Christmas, not even two months ago. I know I looked disappointed, cause my dad asked if I liked it. I knew I had to say yes, since my stepmother was sitting right next to me and she\u2019s really sensitive. In fact, during Christmas my dad had said to just act like I liked my gifts even if I didn\u2019t. So I smiled and said \u201cyeah, I do like the blue.\u201d And just hung around until I could talk to my dad alone. \n\nSo, I had a little while to think about why, specifically, I don\u2019t like this gift. \n1. I already have one. I don\u2019t really need another one, except maybe for convenience of not taking it back and forth to my dads house. \n2. It\u2019s passive aggressive. My other Snuggie had been at my moms house for a while. I hadn\u2019t even been using it, just forgot to bring it back to my dads. I feel like getting me another Snuggie is just him passive aggressively telling me to keep his gifts at his house. \n3. It\u2019s unthoughtful. I think that, by getting just a copy/paste of my Christmas gift, it shows that my dad didn\u2019t really want to put any effort into finding something else I\u2019d enjoy. It seems like he was really banking on the fact that I liked the gift the first time, so why not get another one? \n4. It wasn\u2019t really relevant to me. I like having a blanket with a hood, sure, but I really think gifts should be a way to show that you really know and care about someone, not just an obligation to buy something. If it had been slightly more relevant, maybe. For example, I had told him that I wished the Snuggie had arm holes, so I could play on the computer without having chilly arms. I think that would have been a more relevant gift than the same thing as Christmas. \nHaving these reasons, I felt like a badass and was kind of excited to share my thoughts with my dad.\n\nWhile my dad drove me home, he asked me if I actually liked my gift, as I had been a little \u201coff\u201d since after dinner. I answered honestly, no, I don\u2019t like it. It feels lazy on your part to get me the same gift as Christmas and I wish I had gotten something more thoughtful. He seemed really hurt and I said I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s how I feel. \nHe starts telling me that the concept of not appreciating a gift is so foreign to him, because he grew up needing to get food stamps or go to soup kitchens, and implying,  but not directly stating, that I should be grateful for getting anything. I think this is unreasonable, since we\u2019re probably more of a middle class family and can probably afford gifts, especially since I prefer homemade, thoughtful gifts anyway. I didn\u2019t say that though. \nHe also said that he and my stepmother had actually puta lot of thought into getting me another Snuggie, since they knew I had one at my mom\u2019s house and they wanted me to be comfortable at their house as well. I think this was more of a selfish thing, but I\u2019m biased. I think they just want to make sure they see me using my gift. \nHe brought up the whole \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d thing but I still wasn\u2019t convinced it took a whole lot of thought to get the same thing as Christmas. I said that it doesn\u2019t just matter that someone is giving the gift, it also matters how thoughtful and personal the gift is. I said the Snuggie wasn\u2019t very personal and didn\u2019t seem very thoughtful, and that was pretty disappointing to me. \nOf course I was feeling attacked (unironically) by the part about being ungrateful, and started crying there. I know, teenagers and their silly emotions. This is usually the trend when I have a conversation with my dad, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m faking it for attention, or if I can\u2019t take anyone criticizing me. Overall he definitely won the conversation, but was he right? Before talking to him I thought I was definitely NTA, but now I\u2019m not really sure. Am I the ungrateful asshole?",

This is about a video game so it\u2019s no big deal or anything, just something that\u2019s bugging me a little. \n\nSo this morning I had some extra time before my classes started, and since I usually spend my evenings reading I decided to start up Overwatch and play a competitive game of three. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, Overwatch is a FPS multiplayer, and the competitive mode in Overwatch involves two teams of six either pushing a payload or getting control of a certain point in the map.  If someone leaves the competitive mode of this game, no new players are allowed in so you\u2019re left facing a team of six with five players. You get penalized if you leave a competitive match, you lose 50 points and you\u2019re not allowed to play in that mode for 10 minutes. \n\nDuring my the second game, everything was going fine until one of the members of my team left the game. My team tried but there was just no winning, so everyone except for me left. I wasn\u2019t sure of the extent of the punishment I would receive for leaving a competitive match, and since there was only about 4 minutes left I figured I would just stick around and lose this game so that I could play again immediately after the game. No malicious intent on my part at all. \n\nAt first the other team was sympathetic, but then two or three of them started complaining that I was punishing them by wasting their time because I was salty for my loss. I wanted to explain that this wasn\u2019t the case, but then I figured that no matter what I say they will believe what they want, and there was only a minute left anyway. The messages got rather nasty and I was accused (among other things) of being a bad person and I\u2019m pretty sure they reported my account. I didn\u2019t get mean in my responses to them, just said it wasn\u2019t my fault my team left either and that they were getting a free win, not how you\u2019d want to play a game but not bad for them either. \n\nMy reasoning was that they just needed to wait for a little while and get a free win, and we could all be on our merry way, but after thinking about it I\u2019m feeling guilty. Maybe I should have just left and copped the admittedly mild punishment, and not wasted anyone else\u2019s time. \n\nSo I want to ask the benevolent members of reddit, was I an asshole for not leaving the game?

I agreed before saying that it's not their fault and it can't be help. I explained that my parents are from China and only moved here shortly before I was born, and back there homosexuality was still considered a mental illness up until around 10 years ago.

The older generations as well as other cultures are from different times/worlds and it's not entirely their fault for believing what they believe. I believe that just because people such as my parents are homophobic doesn't mean they are shitty people.

As a young man of 19 years of age, having my cousin offer to be a doner was huge for me however things haven't quite worked out that well.\n\nFor context, my cousin is is a few years older than me, she's long since been the 'golden child' due to her being the oldest and only girl of 4 grandchildren.  At family meals her and her mother would hog the attention of my nan and grandad much to my dad's annoyance leading to a few small spats here and there but an otherwise happy family unit.\n\nThe problems arose with her several months into her vetting process to get her ready to be a doner. On this specific day she had text me roughly 9AM asking for some contact details for a nurse at the hospital. Admittedly, I checked the message, clearly showing her I had read it but did not answer right away. I had some dialysis supplies being delivered and they would take a significant amount of time to organise.\n\nAs fate would have it, that day I had been accidentally booked in for an appointment at a specialist hospital a roughly 1.5 hour drive away. The hospital transport arrived and I had no choice but to go with them and have this appointment. I had no mobile data on my phone and could not contact my cousin whilst I was on my way to the hospital.\n\nI arrived at the hospital and waited in the transport vehicle whilst the driver went to figure out the specifics of the appointment. The hospital I was at had a free wifi connection and so I connected to it to inform my immediate family of where I was as I had been home alone at the time. Almost immediately I saw that I had a message from my cousin and it was honestly one of the most repulsive messages I had ever read. It oozed sarcasm, was overtly condescending and proceeded to remind me of how much she had done for me whilst still having the gall to end with \"I love you (OP name) but I don't love what you're doing right now\".\n\nAll from leaving her on read for under 2 hours.\n\nAt the time, I saw huge flashing danger signs in my head. This woman was supposed to be giving me a kidney, how could I trust that she wouldn't hold that over me for the next 20 or so years a kidney transplant can last? I left that comment on read too whilst I formulated a response. Me, my girlfriend and my dad all chipped in that evening to write an admittedly condescending message that boiled down to \"Stop being childish and I can't have you donate a kidney to me in good faith\".\n\nSince then, she hasn't said a word to me or my family. Her family as well as my nan and grandad blocked all of my family and other than some less than friendly emails between my Dad and Nan there has been almost no contact. Neither side has shown  interest in trying to resolve the issue, this was well over 8 months ago.\n\nSo, AITA Reddit? I won't lie, I feel an immense amount of guilt. Whilst he won't admit it, I fear that my dad misses his mum and dad. They were a big part of his life and I can't help but feel responsible. I could also be living a somewhat normal life by now if I had just taken the message on the chin and not valued my pride so much. The stress I've put on my family with my declining health could have all been avoided. Apologies for the long post but this has been good to get off my chest. Thanks for reading \n\nTl;dr: Potential kidney doner gets annoyed after being left on read. She is removed by me from my potential doner list for being immature and this causes a rift in the family.\n\nP.S: That appointment? The one I spend nearly 3 hours both ways in a hot transport vehicle to go to? It never existed. It was supposed to be the week after but the transport company messed up. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\n\n\n\n\nStay",

Anyways, for some background context I have three best friends, each who I love for different reasons and really value their opinions/advice. Well two of them are super open and understanding, one of them (call her L) can be very judgmental when it comes to topics such as sex, alcohol use, etc (raised super religious). It\u2019s the type of passive judgement that kind of feels worse then direct judgement. So recently I\u2019ve been talking to a mutual guy friend of ours and our relationship has turned somewhat sexual, nothing too serious just very casual. I told my other two best friends about it as I was seeking advice on the situation and they were completely understanding and not judgmental at all, in fact they fully supported me. However, now I feel awful about not telling L due to a fear of being judged/condescended but I\u2019m also scared that if I don\u2019t tell her now she\u2019ll find out later and it will make the situation worse. Also, I have every single class with her (I\u2019m in high school) so I feel like if I tell her I\u2019ll never hear the end of it. I\u2019m pretty conflicted. Am I an asshole for not telling her?",

It's taken a serious toll on me as we both work a lot so we don't get to spend a whole lot of time together during the weekdays. I told her how this makes me feel and she's stopped going for that long a while ago, but now this weekend she wants to leave to go to her 6 y.o cousin's bday party today (saturday) and then stay all the way thru sunday night and have me pick her up again on monday. I'm really trying not to be a controlling boyfriend and try to understand her POV but it is just infuriating to me that she always does this. We have a home. We have a place to live.

This is mainly due to the fact that all my friends have gone back to university due to classes starting on the 7th on January. Because I am on a co-op term, I have to stay in my home city which is hours away from my university. Basically, I'll have no friends to hang out with this year. \n\nBut y'see, I joined this nifty online Discord community so I thought that I would still be able to spend time with some close online friends. Unfortunately for me, many of them are also busy with school and exams and whatnot. However, one of my closer friends, let's refer to her as Sam, doesnt study a lot and spends most of her time playing League of Legends, which I also play with her often. So my birthday hits, I finish work and get home at 7pm where I expect to find Sam online. I see her playing some League of Legends as expected and I ask if she wants to play with me after I finish dinner. She agrees so I promptly head out to dinner so I can finish quicker and have time to play with her. Note: I sleep at 10:30pm due to an early work schedule and Sam is aware of this fact.\n\nSo I finish my birthday dinner and am heading back at around 8pm. I message her to reconfirm that she's available to play with me once I get home. She confirms this fact and I head home. So I get home at around 8:20 and I give Sam a call. She doesn't pick up so I wait in the empty call by myself for a couple minutes before me messages me saying that she will be home in a bit. I'm a bit taken aback by this because I wasn't even aware that she had gone out. So I just so \"ok\" and go watch some youtube for a bit. So fast forward half an hour and Sam has not messaged me since. I ask her what's up and she says she's still not home yet. At around 9pm, she finally msgs me to tell me she's home so I give her a call and get prepared to spend the rest of the day playing some League of Legends with Sam. Before she picks up she messages me \"if ur too tired you can sleep and we can play another time\". I'm completely dumbstruck by that statement and I got the impression that she lowkey didnt want to play so I quickly hang up the call. She notices that and tries to recover by saying \"Oh unless you want to play today\" but I'm not having any of it. Her lack of apologies for being late, lack of notice for her absence, and implying I sleep off my birthday pissed me off. I log off discord and am in such a bad state that I go to get some alcohol. It seems a bit pathetic but I was lonely and bored so I didn't really care at that point that I was drinking alone. Sam calls my phone a couple times and I ignore them and continue drinking because at that point we would only be able to squeeze 2 or 3 games in and in the mood I was in they wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I spent the rest of the day drinking my sorrows away.\n\nI wake up today and log back in on discord and I get a message from Sam saying \"let's play league today!\". I tell her I wanted to play league yesterday but she replies saying that it was my fault we didn't play League because I ignored her calls and whatnot. We argue for a bit with her saying I misunderstood her message and me just getting pissed at her for what she did yesterday. She puts the blame on me and gives a sarcastic apology for her actions such as \"sorry I cant teleport home\". AITA for jumping to conclusions quickly and having too high expectations?",

I\u2019ll even listen to reddit readings on YouTube while I\u2019m doing other things. My mom happens to be a NICU nurse (for those who don\u2019t know that means she takes care of sick and/or premature babies), so I\u2019ve had plenty of discussions on this subject. However, I\u2019ve only ever discussed it myself with people who hold the same opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I was browsing my Facebook feed this morning and happened to see that my childhood friend\u2019s mom shared an article titled \u201cWhat You Didn\u2019t Know About the Aborted Baby Parts in Your Vaccines.\u201d I was shocked because I hadn\u2019t expected to see something that looked like it came straight out of an anti-vax subreddit video on my own Facebook, much less from someone I\u2019ve known for 18 years, but there it was. I skimmed the article and, of course, found it filled with claims like aborted fetal matter being in the chicken pox vaccine, that you can\u2019t be pro-life and pro-vax at the same time, and lots of religious overtones (I am religious myself btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI commented on the post, asking her to please not share \u201cfake news\u201d and concluded with \u201cdon\u2019t fall into the anti-vax trap.\u201d I was a little harsh in my overall reply, but not rude. After commenting, I decided to message the friend whose mom it was that posted the article. I opened with \u201cyour mom is sharing anti-vax articles on Facebook,\u201d expecting a funny convo or at least an interesting conversation. I wanted to know how she felt about it, but her response surprised me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, her mom has always been anti-vax and my friend hasn\u2019t been vaccinated either. I wasn\u2019t expecting this, and it threw me for a loop because I had assumed she was pro-vax and had started off the conversation with an already negative undertone concerning anti-vaxxers. She asked what I expected her to do about her mom posting stuff like that I told her that I didn\u2019t expect her to do anything, I just don\u2019t like that false and dangerous information is being spread so casually. I told her I just wanted her take on it and she said that it\u2019s her mom\u2019s business and even if she didn\u2019t agree that she would appreciate it if I didn\u2019t come after her about it. I apologized and told her that I just have very strong views on the subject. She tells me off by saying that even if I don\u2019t agree with something, I shouldn\u2019t come off so aggressively, especially since it has nothing to do with her. I apologized again, saying that I didn\u2019t mean anything rude by it and the conversation was left at that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis exchange totally ruined my morning and I feel really shitty about the whole thing. I don\u2019t regret commenting on the Facebook post and I still feel very strongly about vaccines, but I feel really bad about unintentionally involving my friend because I didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t pro-vax like me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation??",

I basically had 2 metal bars put into my chest (nuss bars if you want to google it) and had to stay in hospital for like a week afterwards\n\nEventually when school started in August I got sick and went back into hospital (too complicated to fully explain but basically got very unwell). About a week after I got out of hospital I started to go back into school more.\n\nHowever there was 2 people, Bill and Bob (won\u2019t use their real names) who kept shoving the other into me. Since it\u2019s a pretty big school that\u2019s not a surprise but the thing that annoyed me was the fact that it was the same 2 people 5 times within the space of a month. Normally I wouldn\u2019t be annoyed with that but since I had had the surgery it hurt like hell whenever someone bumped into me never mind someone landing on top of me. The first 2 times it happened I had to go back into hospital for an x Ray to make sure the bars hadn\u2019t moved (if they had moved I would die)  and had to be on pain medication for a few days afterwards.\n\nSchool told them to stop but they kept doing it until I wasn\u2019t able to go into school anymore (various reasons) so that (sort of) ended that.\n\nFlash forward to last summer where I got sick again and spent another month in hospital. Was very sick at one point but got out and just had to take some meds since then.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of being out of hospital one of my friends told me that they were in an Xbox party with bill (the guy who kept shoving bob into me) and he was taking the piss out of me for being in hospital and saying that I should just go back in.\n\nFor that and several other reasons my friend who was in the party stopped talking to them so things were good for a while.\n\nExcept about a month ago they and someone else (his name shall be Steve) somehow found my WhatsApp number and reddit account (they aren\u2019t linked in any way at all aside from me saying about my reddit on group chats and stuff).\n\nI tried blocking them but they just made new accounts\n\nThey ended up sending some wierd messages (calling me a retarded cunt, faggot and n*gger among other things) and they also sent porn (it was Hitler porn and shit) and threatened to kill me.\n\nAfter a few days they stopped talking to me completely. I thought that was the end of it but no.\n\nA couple of days ago Steve started messaging me on WhatsApp saying that I had asked him for a fight and stuff. I hadn\u2019t (Iv never wanted to have a physical fight in my life). He then started messaging stuff like \u201clove you *kiss*\u201d and other stuff.\n\nSo anyway I told my friends about it and stuff and most of them agreed with me that they were dicks and stuff (obviously) except one said that I should just keep talking to the guys and that \u201cthe stuff they said wasn\u2019t bad\u201d and got annoyed at me for not wanting to talk to them\n\nMy question is AITA for not wanting to talk to those guys?\n\nSorry for the massive amount of text.",

I didn\u2019t want to decide until we kissed because that\u2019s the easiest way for me to figure out how I feel about someone, if I\u2019m attracted to them or not.  \n\nEventually when we started kissing he kissed really hard and used a lot of tongue and I thought it was gross.

I am not a super good liar but I tried to make it convincing because I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.

The model in question was actually 22 or so in those shoots though so definitely not underaged. \n\nShe did kind of have a youthful face, I guess, soft, roundish face, small chin and relatively wide midface.

They even scream in the car, and it's a fight to get the volume on anything playing under 50. From 7 AM to past midnight, it's a constant barrage of pointless noise that makes actually spending time with family either very stressful or nearly impossible. I have approached family members asking them to please be more quiet, offering solutions and compromises, but I get told \"Well OP, the world can't change to suit your needs.\" And I get that, but I kind of wish that I could at least be met halfway at the family home where I am supposedly always welcome.

I told him at the time I wouldn\u2019t know what my schedule would be like, so don\u2019t book for me. It would be 4 weeknights, and I\u2019ve just started my post grad and am on the job hunt, so I\u2019m trying to keep myself available. \n\n\nAbout 2 days ago he tells me his parents have booked the hotel for 6 people (parents, my partner and I and his brother + brother\u2019s girlfriend) and asked if I wanted to come. I have 3 pieces of assessment due over those 4 days, so I told him I wouldn\u2019t be able to come even if I wanted to.  The next day we got into a big fight about it, since his parents already booked for me and he\u2019s upset that I don\u2019t want to do this with his family/I\u2019m not making the effort for him. We\u2019ve had similar arguments before regarding my commitment to his family/events. He\u2019s very extroverted and has a lot of family that he wants me to meet and be as close to as he is, but I\u2019m extremely introverted and my family consists of my parents and my 1 uncle I see about 4 times a year, so, although I've been trying my best, it\u2019s been a huge change for me. In addition to this, he knows I hate weddings and I really have nothing in common with his family. I can\u2019t help but feel as though unless I\u2019m attending every single event, AND being happy about it, it\u2019s not enough. (FWIW I\u2019m always polite and friendly with his family, and I'm good friends with his brother.)\n\n\nI ended up venting about it to my parents, and my mother told me that being anti-social and admitting that I don\u2019t get along with his family would ruin our relationship and that I wasn\u2019t making enough of an effort. When I asked her if I should lie and say \u201cI wish I could go\u201d she said yes. \n\n\nI\u2019ve had some time to reflect on the situation, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just being immature for not wanting to go to this event, and if maybe I should just suck it up because that\u2019s how relationships work. I don\u2019t want to lie to my partner about my wants and needs and the kicker is: I wasn\u2019t even invited to the wedding. Neither was his brother\u2019s gf. His parents just hoped that we could show up under the pretence that \u201cwe\u2019re already here\u201d. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been told I can be unempathetic and cold before, and I thought I'd worked on that, but I'm worried that I'm too dumb to see what I've done wrong, so I really need some sort of outside perspective. I never really thought our difference in social needs/family would have such an impact on our relationship, but it seems to really be grating on him. I\u2019ve made no requirements for him to get to know my family, so it feels like a double standard, but his family is clearly very important to him, so I can see how that\u2019s a false equivalence.

I just don\u2019t know if my behavior makes me an asshole.\n\nI recently moved in with a dear friend of mine (my best friend, really. All that lame girl shit: planning to be each other\u2019s maids of honors, etc.) into a city she\u2019s been living in for a while. It\u2019s been pretty lonely, I\u2019m not sure how to make new friends.. Jan\u2019s really busy, working the work week and having extensive plans during the weekends with friends, keeping up with hobbies, etc. I was always excited to see jan when she came home, trying to squeeze in a few moments to chat or maybe watch something together. We\u2019re both pretty \u201csilly\u201d people and so I thought we had a running bit about me play-annoying her. She loves the frozen franchise so I would knock on her door and sing the do you want to build a snowman song.\n\nI have a chronic pain disorder, so I warned her that when I moved in I might keep to myself more than she\u2019d expect. Which I do. But she\u2019s maybe in our apartment for an hour or two a day when she\u2019s not asleep or has her door closed doing other things, etc, and she is my only true person to really see in person to hang out with. So, the other night, I was trying to chat with her about her day while she folded laundry in our kitchen and she said \u201cremember when you said you were gonna keep to yourself mostly laughter I was looking forward to that.\u201d And I said \u201cI\u2019m ... sorry?\u201d And Jan replied \u201cwell I\u2019m just trying to get some laundry done and here you are...\u201d And I stepped back from the situation and apologized for bothering her while she was trying to get something done, because she was right. If she only has a bit of time to accomplish task while she\u2019s home, it\u2019s unfair of me to try and monopolize it for myself. It\u2019s no fault of hers that I\u2019m having a difficult time trying to make some new friends. I told her I\u2019d be better at leaving her alone, and went into my room for the night.\n\nI miss her, but I decided not to bother her so I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve really only seen her when she sought out to see me. \n\nWe\u2019re from the same hometown, and she left earlier this week to visit her family for Thanksgiving. We had a rather awkward exchange about it this week, as she has complained rather frequently about going home for the holidays because of her extended family not being her favorite company. My birthday is around the holiday, so for the last two years we\u2019ve spent thanksgiving together, so she kept mentioning that she hasn\u2019t seen them in a while because of me, so she was going to go anyway. After weeks of this, on Tuesday I asked her to please stop complaining about going home to me, because my Thanksgiving plans included working many long hard hours (work in a Bakery) up until the day, and then going home at about 1 pm to be in an empty apartment by myself. She replied \u201cwell, you could have asked me to stay back with you.\u201d But I don\u2019t really feel I could have. She told me she \u201calways\u201d planned on coming back on Saturday \u201cjust for your birthday.\u201d\n\nMy birthday is on Saturday but I got off from work so i decided I take the train to our hometown tomorrow morning. she keeps texting me asking what my plans are. I\u2019ve responded honestly, that I\u2019d like to spend it with my parents and my brother, being with my dogs at home, and she\u2019s welcome to join us, and to come over whenever if she\u2019d like. I won\u2019t really have gifts this year, and I don\u2019t plan on making a big deal out of it. It\u2019s just nice to have a weekend off from work. She\u2019s acting as if I\u2019m avoiding her or being rude, and not making a specific plan is inconvenient for her. I told her if she\u2019s busy she can pick a time and maybe a place for lunch or something and I\u2019ll meet her there. This only seemed to upset her more? My birthday was never a big discussion point before the laundry debacle. I think I\u2019ve just made her feel guilty, which wasn\u2019t my goal and I\u2019ve told her that multiple times. But I don\u2019t know if my behavior reflects that. \n\nTl;dr: my friend told me I\u2019ve been bothering her. I apologized, and stepped back. She\u2019s upset that I don\u2019t have a lot of interest in making specific plans for my birthday, which I wouldn\u2019t ... anyway.\n\nAITA?",

They've always been conservative, but they've fallen HARD into all the shit that's going on today. We have a family rule not to talk about politics at family gatherings because it always ends in an argument, but my grandfather always finds a way to inject some racist remark into the conversation. It's gotten to the point where no one even enjoys getting together anymore because everyone's tiptoeing around each other trying not to set someone off. My entire family is being held emotionally hostage because no one wants to say something that would trigger grandpa and get him ranting about some racist , xenophobic shit.\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for four years, and we've lived together for almost three of those. Everyone in my family knows except my grandparents who would throw a fit if they found out. It's to the point where if we're spending the night at my parents on a holiday we put our things in separate bedrooms to keep up a facade that we're not going to sleep together.

We were in the process of calling everyone in our family to announce our engagement. As expected everyone was very excited and congratulatory, then we get to my grandparents. The first words out of my grandfather's mouth were \"well you better hurry up!\" as in, \"you better do it soon or we won't be around to see it\".\n\nMy fiance and I laughed it off, but on the inside I actually thought to myself for the first time \"good\". There's a lot of other shit going on in our lives right now, so we were planning on a long engagement anyway. We're not planning on having the kind of traditional wedding they'd be happy with, so I'm sure they'd have something to say about that, and I really just don't want what's supposed to be a fun celebration sullied by their bullshit.

All I hear all day long is pregnancy jokes, comments, or baby talk. Especially now as her due date is around the corner.\n\nI am happy for her, but I have had 3 miscarriages within the past 13 months. The last one I had major complications with and there is a chance I won't be able to get pregnant again as a result. My coworkers are aware of the last one because it happened later in the pregnancy (22 weeks) and we had announced. \n\nI'm genuinely happy for her, I really am. And I try to be supportive. But, I cannot make myself be enthusiastic. \n\nThe office manager confronted me about it this morning because I'm the only person not constantly asking the pregnant coworker how she's feeling, etc and the manager noticed. She feels I should be over what happened or at least be able to pretend enthusiasm. Again I have always been supportive and kind to the pregnant coworker, I just don't gush over her or start conversations with her that involve her pregnancy or child. \n\nI thought I was doing fine, but this confrontation by the office manager makes me wonder if I'm really being an asshole? I don't talk about my miscarriages with any of them anymore, not since I was finally over the medical complications and even that was just because I couldn't do things at work that I normally do without risking a trip to the ER. I'm a very private person and I while I was open with saying \"I'm not ok, but I'm doing better than yesterday.\" I never opened up to anyone in the office about what I was going through beyond just \"this happened and as a result I can't do X until my doctor clears me for that type of work\". \n\nI honestly don't know if I can fawn over my pregnant coworker at this point. I feel horrible about it after what my manager said, but its all I can do sometimes to just smile and nod to the conversation regarding her pregnancy/baby instead of crying. I don't expect everyone to treat me special by any means, but am I really the asshole for not pretending to be ecstatic about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "Hey everyone, I mostly need to vent, but please smite me with your judgement if you feel like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Let's start with some background.**\n\nI am a freelance game developer with multiple years of experience, and I work full-time on my own projects. I have a friend, who currently studies VR and UX design in uni, let's call him M. He has a girlfriend, who is a first-year gamedev student, let's call her L. L and M are also artists, kind of. We are all about the same age, around 20. I also want to emphasise that 'friend's GF' is not necessarily equal to 'my friend' in this case.\n\nL has a task for this semester - to make a game trailer. She decided that she doesn't want to throw away (???) the idea and the art after she completes the task, and wants to make a game. Us three have agreed to team up and work together. Now, this is important: during the initial meetup, L said things like \"this is **my** project\" and \"**I** have the rights for this idea\". I explicitly said that since this is her project, she will be responsible for the workflow and design, and I will only code and build. This will be a good practice for her, and the game is very simple, so this shouldn't be a big problem. We all agreed on that.\n\nI'm not going to go into the details, I'll just say that it's a simple mobile game. I also want to clarify that the basic workflow of making a game is as follows: take the idea you want to work on, make a game design document, make a prototype, refine, test, deploy (repeat 4 and 5 if necessary). It is generally considered a bad practice to freestyle things and work on later stages before the earlier stages. E.g. you make the music and high-quality models for the game, and then end up not using anything because the game gets reworked six times in prototyping.\n\nSo the next thing I talk about on this meeting is the GDD and the importance of making design choices in the beginning. I also mention multiple times that I, as a person who builds everything, need to know what needs to be done and how it should look/feel/work before I start working on the prototype. I ask her if she can compile everything into a single document as she did before, and advice her to use google and ask her teachers if she struggles with something.\n\nThis spring, L was making a project for her university entrance exam. The task was to basically design a game. This is important since she was capable of making a design document and other necessary things to show off and describe a game idea, therefore she knows what to do and how to do it. She periodically asked for help, and I helped where I could, without getting too involved, since this was her exam, not mine. Before that, I helped other people with their projects and ideas, all for free (there is a certain tendency here).\n\nThis time, I expected to be able to finally work as a part of the team. Not to do everything myself, not babysit everyone, just do my part and make a game. Oh boy. Was I ever as fucking wrong as this time. I mean, what can be easier than writing a few pages explaining the basic ideas? Core and meta, how to monetize, how should the menu look, what SFX and VFX we might need. The answer is, many things, but making a design document is not the most difficult part of making a game. Mind that is is also not final, you can and have to make changes to the GDD, but it's oh so difficult to work without it.\n\nWe \"started\" two months ago. L tried to make me write this thing a few times, and I kept sending her to google things and/or ask her teachers. She also kept feeding me with small, random, unstructured blobs of information, maybe hoping that I will compile them myself. I was close to doing this myself a few times but kept reminding myself that this time, I'm not the designer, she is the designer. Therefore, I was patiently waiting for her to write a three-page document. For two months. Last week I received two paragraphs with no useful info and replied that this isn't enough.\n\nI might have skipped a few details, I hope that it's nothing important, if you need clarification - please comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now the real story finally begins.**\n\nThis part will be biased since I'm still rather angry. I'm honestly trying to be objective, but it's hard.\n\nAfter our last dialogue, I was afk for a few days. I had stuff to do, personal stuff, and I honestly think I have a right to do my stuff whenever I want to. So, I return, power on the station, and get quite a shitpost from L *in our work chat,* that is supposed to be used for concept art, file sharing, and discussion. Anyways.\n\nI come back, and send her one of my own old design documents *as an example*. Why should I even do this, literally google this, please, it takes 3 minutes, and you have a whole faculty full of gamedevs! L responds, saying that it's my fault that she couldn't use google for two months, because \"if only I sent her the file a week ago she would've done everything earlier\". And she just keeps on fucking going on about how \"nobody is doing anything\" and \"you only do the code while I do everything else\" and \"it's such a shame that my amazing idea is getting lost because of you all\", and the best one is \"you are not helping me do my job\". I get it, you're a student, but I'm not supposed to teach you how to make games. I agreed to work for free. I think this is kind of enough of an investment.\n\nRegarding the code and stuff, it's a valid point, kind of. But we agreed on this initially, didn't we? Like, not taking into the account that code+build is 50% of the job, so it's a bit impolite to say this anyway.\n\nAnd here comes the fun part. She says, \"this is OUR game, it will only be MY game when I finish studying\". I'm honestly kind of taken aback by this. So, like, it's your game while it's easy, and then suddenly it's our game? What is this, some sort of conditional communism? Flip the switch and you're the boss, flip again and it's our job? So I'm confused and I ask her to calm down and tell her that if this load is too difficult for her, it might be a bad idea to continue studying/working in this field since it's only downhill from here (speaking from personal experience).\n\nNow, my opinion is that this is bullcrap. You can't call yourself the boss and then just shrug it off as soon as you have to do something. You also can't really say that you don't want to be the boss but keep talking shit. So I breathe in, breathe out, and logically explain to her that this is just workflow. You can't expect to get things done if you don't do them properly, and I have told her on multiple occasions what is the correct approach to this task. That I understand that this is difficult, that she also has to study, and maybe it wasn't the best idea to make a game at this point in time. If writing a small document is so difficult, maybe it's just not your thing, right? Fucken, wrong.\n\nAnd the shitstorm begins. If previously, the shit was just dripping from the ceiling fan, now the pipes of shit have burst full and wide, and the pressure is beyond imaginable. It's like Nurgle himself has arrived in our chat. \"You are lazy. You are a cunt. You don't do your job. You are not helping me. Oh, I'm just a beginner, and *this* is your motivational speech for me. Oh, I was hoping that you would do everything for me. You are acting so smug and grown up, why don't you guide me.\" You get the point.\n\nShould I spend my own time teaching and guiding a (basically) random person, because I know how to? Should I do L's job for her? Should I maybe do everything for her? Should I wipe her ass every time she takes a shit? Greatest minds of millennia still don't have answers to these questions. Keep in mind, M isn't really saying anything in this situation, and I understand that he is kind of between a rock and a hard place, and I don't blame him. I also want to point out that I haven't dropped the project yet, and I'm still waiting for the bloody design document.\n\nI personally feel like I should rush and help, as I always do, \"Take the wheel, Kuro!\" But I am so fucking tired. I help my friends and family because they are friends and family. I help my other half because she is my light and shadow. But I'm not there like a robot to complete requests from random people on a daily basis. I used to be stuck in this trap for a long time, doing things other people didn't want to do themselves, just because I can. Now I find it toxic, and I think it impairs personal growth and development in others. Am I the asshole?\n\nI might have missed things, but the general story is here. The post turned out to be twice as long as I expected it to be. I also might be completely wrong in my opinion that you're not supposed to talk shit to your coworkers, especially if they are working for free. I raise my glass to all of you who have finished reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr** A person decided to jump over their head, I refused to do their work, got shit-talked and advised them to change the field of study, while it's not too late.",

O almost always gave in. O would tell us how the \"talks\" were just him begging.

At this point, we already knew we were shitty friends for allowing this to go on in the first place. \n\nAbout an hour, the party had mostly broken up and it was just O, me and 2 others. X pulled up and O got in as usual.

My sister refused and started saying \"Fuck you\" over and over and telling my mom that she can't live here anymore.

            "input": "Okay, this is complicated, and I've been getting mixed responses from the friends I've shared with, so I think I need a neutral set of eyes to look at the situation. I'll try to keep this brief, but knowing me it'll be a novel, so be prepared.\n\nHere's the backstory - my sister is 17 now, and I'm 26 (almost). Because of our age difference I helped to raise her in some ways, and as kids we often spent time together. And I swear, I've never loved anyone more than I loved my sister. To say that for most of her life she's been my entire world would be an understatement. She was my everything, we influenced each other a lot when she was younger. She got a great sense of humor thanks to me (a trait the two of us share but neither of our parents does), as well as a love for videogames, anime and other nerdy stuff. Some of my best memories were spent with her, playing games side by side, or her watching me play through something that's too difficult for her, or me helping her beat her first game. \n\nAnd then she entered high school (this was a few years ago, when she was 13), and things changed. She suddenly matured a lot, both in terms of her personality and body. She started getting interested in make-up, fancy shampoos and clothes, which I (despite being female) never quite cared about, these things have always been a means to an end rather than something to obsess about. She got her own group of friends her age for the first time (she's often had 1-2 close friends but has never been part of a group). Eventually she found a boyfriend too. And you know what? That's fantastic and perfectly normal. I was a loser in high school, the weird kid everyone bullied and made fun of, but she's a popular girl, a cheerleader and overall highly social. Which is great, and I genuinely could not be happier that she's having fun in school.\n\nThe problems started to emerge when her personality shift suddenly made me second fiddle. Obviously our relationship could never be the same as it used to be, she's a teenager and I'm in my 20s, with a job, I get that we wouldn't be able to spend too much time together. But we barely spent *any* time together at all. Every evening she brought along her group of friends to girly scream all night, which sucked considering the fact that I was trying to sleep. Requests to do this less often were rebuffed by both her and my mother (who considers me the disappointment of the family and is beyond happy my sister is turning out so different from me). This ultimately led to me moving out. \n\nAfter that, whenever I tried to initiate contact with her I'd usually be rebuffed. Half the time whenever I said hi to her on Messenger she'd leave me hanging on \"seen\", and when I asked her about it she used the excuse of \"Oh, the messages are not showing up for me\" (bullshit). Whenever I asked to hang out, either at my place to play something or watch a movie, or maybe hang out at the mall or go for coffee (I try to meet her halfway, interest-wise) she'd say yes, and then when a day before the date or sometimes on the date itself she'd message me saying she's made plans with a friend of hers and won't be coming. I'd invite the family to dinner at my place, and last-minute I'd get a call from my mother telling me my sister doesn't feel like coming.\n\nGradually we lost touch. The first time this happened we didn't speak for about a year, and us getting back in touch was mostly orchestrated by my mother. She was overjoyed to have me back in her life, and I was too, and for a while things were great! This lasted maybe a month, maybe two tops, and then she was back to her old self again, and the same thing happened, we stopped speaking. And that brings us to our current situation. A few months ago she messages me out of the blue and is like \"Let's hang out\", so I say sure, why not, olive branch and stuff. We hang out, it's super fun, and she off-handedly mentions that her boyfriend has a D&amp;D group that he refuses to let her into, and she'd really like to play. I say \"Don't worry, I've ran D&amp;D games too, I'll invite a few friends over and we can play.\"\n\nI organize everything, invite her, her boyfriend and three of my own friends to play, and it was without a doubt the worst D&amp;D session I've ever had in my life, mostly because of her. Her character was completely wrong for the setting (she wanted to play Connor from \"Detroit\" in a fantasy setting), she had almost no usable skills, and despite the fact that a few days prior we went over this and told her to make a paladin with certain skills, even going over the character backstory together, she listened to none of that. Halfway through she completely refused to participate at all, just sat quietly on her phone while the rest of us played. Surprise-surprise, after the fact she whined to her boyfriend about how \"left out\" she felt, and he happily invited her into his own D&amp;D group. The three friends and I planned to continue playing, and I invited the boyfriend over with us since he seemed to have fun, but he said my sister told him he wouldn't be a real man by her if he went. So he refused. And it's really hard for me not to see this whole thing, with her suddenly getting back into touch, as a plan for her to get what she wanted and couldn't have, namely a place on her boyfriend's group. \n\nI'm thoroughly disgusted by her behavior in front of my friends and cut contact, and she doesn't try to contact me either (I haven't blocked her anywhere but neither of us write). Very recently I happened to adopt a kitten, the sweetest, most lovable snugglebug in the whole world. My mother came over and fell in love with her, and she regularly comes by to play with her while I'm at work. This week she took my sister along with her, and apparently my sister really loved the kitten. Right as rain, today I get a call from my sister out of the blue saying how sorry she is for the D&amp;D and asking to come hang out. And I wasn't mean, I wasn't rude, but I honestly explained that we're not really friends anymore, we've grown too far apart, and this has been working out for me. It's amazing to not have someone who treats you like you're nothing most of the time, it really is. And she said \"Okay, I'm sorry\" and burst into tears. \n\nAnd now I feel like an absolute ass. Because on one hand maybe she contacted me out of the blue, like before, to get something she wants - namely time to spend with the kitten. After all why contact me now, of all times? She had plenty of time before. Not to mention even if her intentions are 100% unrelated to the kitten, what's my guarantee that she won't start treating me like dirt in 2-3 weeks? After all this behavior is nothing new, she's been doing it for years, and I doubt she's matured enough in just a few months. But on the other, what if this was a genuine attempt for her to try and change our relationship for the better? What if she truly wanted to turn over a new leaf and I shut her down? I'd love to have her as a friend, I really would, but only if she was willing to put in the work to be my friend rather than making me do it all. If she's planning to go back to her old tricks, or just uses me as an excuse to come pet my cat, then I don't really need her in my life. \n\nI don't know her intentions and this is really the source of my conflict. Should I have given her yet another shot hoping she'd matured and learned from her mistakes? Am I the asshole for rejecting her?",

He's put down deposits and requested people send him cash so he's not out of pocket for long.  We're talking about $2000 USD total for the week per person.  No problem, I look at the breakdown of costs to make sure I'm not overpaying as I don't want him to owe me money at the end of it as I suspect it's going to be a bitch to get it back from him.  I notice that they overcharged me $150, innocent mistake, I bring it to their attention and they tell me, np just pay us $1850.  I send it.  Incidentally right after I send payment, the other organizer says that the amount was for contingency / incidentals, but no big deal we'll just settle at the end.  A few days later, he brings the subject up again saying it's not fair to the group that I didn't pay the extra $150.  I explain that he said it was fine and I also let him know that the banker has been a notoriously slow payer to me and I don't want to have a balance owed to me by him by the end of this.  He disagrees as my issue with my friend has nothing to do with the group (which I don't think makes any sense since a balance will likely be owed one way or another).

Perhaps everyone else knew that she used bases and I was just out of the loop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later she shows another piece of art and Sam compliments the anatomy. That was a red flag. I felt that these people didn't know that she was using bases. I guess it ticked me off that she was basically claiming that all the art was her's.

We always got along well and we'd message each other every day just to chat and all that kind of stuff. At the back end of the year his grandma passed away and she was someone that he had been close to all his life, he basically hasn't really been the same since. However that was never an issue for me, I would always let him know that I was there to support him and always be able to give him someone to talk to when he had any issues. We would still always message and hang out after school, played on the same sports team and just overall had a good strong friendship.  \n\n  \n\nEverything seemed to be turning around again until he had a big crush on a girl. To cut a long story short he was always interested in her and they would hang out as friends but he always saw her as more than friends while she didn't feel the same way. When he asked her out and she declined he started to really struggle mentally again and couldn't get over it. Around this time he started to cut a lot of people out of his life and completely removed all forms of social media he had and stopped talking to a lot of his other friends. He would talk about how he trusted nobody and that everyone was just fake and hated him.  \n\n\n\nEven currently after almost 6 months he still can't seem to get over her. I've always been there to help him with his troubles and I've always been there to support and help him but recently things have just gotten worse. Last Tuesday the cops arrived at his house and after he told me that he had attempted to kill himself. I continued to be there to listen to him and make sure he understood that I was on his side all the way and that I would help him in any way I could.  \n\n  \n\nHowever over time and especially lately It's just become increasingly draining to me mentally. For starters he has mentioned in the past that he \"feels that he should be a priority and not an after thought\" and seems to always be needing to rant to me. Additionally he seems to be rather insensitive to my needs and while i'm always willing to help him I don't feel he returns that favour to me and things are always about him. The final thing that is maybe the straw that breaks the camels back is the fact that he doesn't seem to hold back in insulting me and making fun of me at times, often being condescending with the way he handles any help I try to offer him.   \n\n  \n\nI don't feel like it would be right to just cut off with him especially during such a tough time for him but personally it is really taxing on me and I just don't feel like this is a true friendship anymore. In a way it seems like its all about him and I just have to be there to take of his issues. Maybe I just need to toughen up and stick through but I'm really not too sure.  \n\n  \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?",

I know 100% I didn't cheat and since I've been with my new GF, we've lived together for just about every day of our relationship and I kinda would have noticed she was cheating and why would she have told me..? Also my new GF had an STD test in October and it came back clean...\n\nSo I'm really confused as to how this happened but when I asked my SO to go get tested, she had a shit fit and it was not a fun time (obviously)...",

She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I\u2019m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don\u2019t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21.\n\nFast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it\u2019s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can\u2019t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid.\n\nI just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it\u2019s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don\u2019t think I can be that, I\u2019ve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you\u2019ll have for your kid but I just never had that.\n\nSo WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get\u2019s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don\u2019t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I\u2019m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he\u2019s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective.\n\nTLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he\u2019s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption?",

We started dating after she had finished her clinical. Fast forward few months, she applied for and got a job on the unit I worked on. Because it was different shifts and my old role required travel we rarely saw each other. Fast forward to now (at this point now dating 1.5 years) I tried out for US Navy and got medically DQ'd at basic (still dating GF). Came back and basically told all my former employers what happened and that I'm looking for work. The unit my GF works on (where I used to work) immediately told me they would hire me back, only this time we would work similar shifts and roles(so likely work together closely). I really want to take this position over other offers I have as I love the unit, the management is great, and the colleagues are amazing. It's also much safer than other hospitals I have worked at (I've always worked in psychiatric care and this is the best workplace I have had). I was very forward with management about relationship and they said HR okayed us working together and they are cool with it because of my good work history there and professionalism. Only my GF doesn't want me to work there, she says she feels this way because she doesn't want to mix her personal/professional life, she feels it's \"her workspace\" now, and is worried about other coworkers talking about us/watching us under a microscope.

As we got older our relationship became more faceted and I think his hatred for me grew deeper. I can only assume he hates me based off of what he's said to me, and I can't really blame him. I was the nightmare little sister, his parents were divorcing as he was in the womb and he was only about a year and a half old when his dad remarried to his step mom and had me. I know it must've been hard and with two parents bidding for his love with video games, and tech, and toys rather than love it would've hurt.\n\nI always knew he hated me, ever since I was little I could play with him, and I can still interact with him, it's just I know he hates me, it's always been a part of our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day my dad announced we were going to the beach and I had an anxiety attack, it was the first time I'd ever had one which made it scarier and it was because of something that had happened the last time I was at that lake. We called the trip off, I didn't intend for this to happen I just knew I'd never go back to that lake again. After this was decided my brother walked into a room I was in and proceeded to tell me that I was ruining the family and was the reason our dad had depression. He told me he knew I would just go crying to our mom and that I shouldn't tell her what he said, I didn't for a long, long time.\n\nMy brother came into me and my cousin's at the time room to tell me that he was such a good person, because he had so much dirt on people he could ruin anyone's reputation at any time and he didn't. I mentioned to my cousin after he left the room that what he said was something a sociopath would say (I know that's mean spirited but at the time I was just in a bad mood and wanted nothing to do with him.) He came back into the room to tell me that he was so empathetic he knew exactly what people wanted to hear and he knew how to destroy people as well. He told me I was extremely unempathetic and it showed, I'm someone who prides myself on compassion, so hearing that hurt and I'm still afraid to this day that he was speaking truth.\n\nMy brother came home from his mom's one day and gave me a hug telling me he learned that he should appreciate family, but the hug felt empty, it was like it was just there for show and I'm still not sure if I'm just paranoid or not, I just know I can still feel his contempt for me. (P.S I can't remember if the 2nd paragraph incident occurred before or after his supposed revelation about family.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this was so long\n\nI've vented to my friends about his issues before, speculating that the trauma combined with his behavior, and the fact that our dad has NPD might be a sign of a personality disorder, I have a therapist I just sometimes can't hold it in, and that's my fault.\n\nSo AITA for speculating that my brother might have a personality disorder?",

She used to invite me to go out with her but since she moved in with her boyfriend recently, she's just been coming to my house and going out with him and other people, until I asked her why she didn't want to hang out so much. I thought she was spending extra time with her partner and had, you know, forgotten her other friends still exist. She said no, it was cos she didn't want to invite me to things if I might be upset that I couldn't come if I wasn't well. I explained that I was upset cos she seemed to not want to hang out as much and could she please not decide for me what I was well enough to do or not, just invite me and let me decline, as she knows my health changes day to day. \n\nAnyway. This weekend I wasn't feeling well and I asked her if we could hang out, she said yes and came to my house. I wasn't sure how far I could go out, so we went to the beach right nearby.\n\nAfter about an hour she was texting loads, then announced she was gonna go to the pub with her boyfriend and his friend - both of whom are my friends too - for st Patrick's day and she was gonna wear a green top I gave her. She said she was feeling bored on the beach.\n\nShe made no move to invite me to join them until I asked if I could come if I want to and she said yes I could come. I decided it would be too far for me to go in the end. We left so she could go join them. I felt a bit shit about not being able to go but way worse about apparently not being welcome. \n\nThen stupidly, I emailed her asking why she didn't invite me at first, and if it was cos of my health could she, again, not decide for me what I can do, and if it was cos she didn't want me to come then that's her choice. Then I felt like shit for asking her to justify her decision not to invite me cos she doesn't have to invite me or explain. \n\nBut basically my best friend said that she was bored of me and was gonna hang out with our other friends instead, after an hour on the beach, when I was expecting an afternoon with her - looked like she was bored of me not just the beach. And I felt she was only there to help, not cos she wanted to see me - it's hard to be great company when you're not very well but I'm hardly a charity case.\n\nShe didn't reply to my question (I immediately wrote again to say sorry for asking and she doesn't have to answer). I think I've either lost a friend cos she doesn't like me anymore, or I've lost a friend cos I'm being stupid about whether she likes me or not.\n\nIs she the asshole for excluding me from our mutual friends?

After my mun was pregnant with me, my dad said he wanted to teach me piano (he was a music teacher at a local school). My mum agreed. As soon as I was born, my dad showed his bad sides, gambling, drinking, smoking a lot. When I turned 5, he taught me to play the piano, well taught would be wrong, as he more or less beat the lessons into me. My mum didn't know about it as I didnt say anything. during the span of one year, he became more and more violent, hitting my mum and even attacking her with a knife once whilst drunk. My mum decided to leave him in a rush, for the sake of our safety. Now I don't know if this has to do anything with it, but I was a rough child. my mum had to give up a job, as she had to constantly go to the kindergarden or school, whenever I misbehaved (fighting and doing dumb shit). I got diagnosed with ADHD and my mum decided to resort to medicine (I don't blame her). It worked out and I behaved well. Fast forward a bit and I'm 14. We're on a vacation to see my dads parents who I haven't seen in 12 years (so never really). My dad was also there at that time with his new daughter, about 5 years old. I really liked her as she's been the kind of little sister I've always wanted. My little sister was never on good terms with me, dunno why tbh. \nFast forward 2 days and we're still there. A stupid family arguement breaks out with two sides. The agressive A-Holes including my father and his bitch sister who claimed that my cousin punched her son (she didn't) and the ones that wanted to talk, including all of my family, my cousin, my grandparents and some other cousins. My dad goes to attack one of the male cousins with a pipe which he blocks. fight ends as soon as my dads older brother arrives. He tells us to leave for our own safety (in a kind way, gave us money for a hotel) and apologised for his siblings behaviour. This incident was the last time I saw my dad. \n\nI also need to add, that I am still playing piano and if it wasnt for me learning the piano, I wouldn't have got to known the most amazing person I've ever met, who made my life so much more joyable. I know that she would've wanted me to meet up with my dad as well. I'm grateful to my dad that he gave me this gift.\n\nNow here comes the thing:\nMy mother has been badmouthing my dad forever, and tbh most of those things I would say sound like things he'd do. But I don't hold grudges against people, as life is simply to short for that. My mother on the other hand still hates him and I understand. \nHe contacted me and my sister in November 2018, if we wanted to meet up every two weeks again. My sister instantly said no. I don't blame her, She barely got to know this man, only a few times and he just jelled and had a pipe in his hand. I on the other hand agreed. Now I do have the right to see my dad and my mother or anyone else can't do anything against it. She got pissed at me for saying yes, calling me a \"betrayer\" (haven't heard that for the first time) and saying \"do you know what I had to go through, do you know how much therapy I needed to get past his abuse?\"\nWell I said no but I still wanted to see him. \nWe somehow ended the arguement and left it open. My dad contacted me last week, saying he wanted to meet me. How'd he get my number? I didn't care. All I cared about was if he's the real guy. So I asked a couple of questions which he got right. He told me his wife got a second child after the first one and they want to meet their big brother. Now, he did contact my sister but she instantly blocked him. I didn't tell my mum. Instead I told we'd meet at a caf\u00e9 and I'd bring along a friend. Time comes and we're at the meeting and talking about how things are. He invites us to his place and we meet the girls. They are lovely and I love both of them. The wife is also very kind and caring. I left with a positive attitude.\nI went home and told my mum that \"oh yeah, today I met up with dad\"\nshe just asked \" what do you mean\" so I told hee the same thing I just told you guys. Shw gets furious, screaming at me that she told me not to do it and even if, I needed her permission. \nThe incident spread throughout the family in an hour and I got threats from different family members. One said he'd take away my laptop, console and piano (all things I paid for with my part time job money) to which I replied he can go ahead, as I wont back down about meeting him regularily. He took the laptop and the console. well I wanted to go to the police about it but my mum said she'd not file a complaint (I needed parental confirmation or some shit like wtf) \nThe piano stayed as my mum convinced her brother/my uncle to stop it).\nI'm in this situation where I don't know what to do. \nI understand my mothers worried actions, but she needs to understand how I feel too (which is always last priority in this family).\n\nAITA, does ESH or is NTA?",

My family stopped celebrating birthdays when I was in elementary school; we would receive a gift and be told happy birthday but there was no party or cake or anything like that. So I have tried to work on my birthday every year since I turned 14.\nI have been married for 7 years and my husband and his family celebrate birthdays like normal people. I have never asked to do anything for my birthday or even ask for a gift but they always get me gifts and usually want to go for dinner if we can. This year I asked to go to lunch and the movies with my husband. I also worked up the courage to finally ask for a couple things that I've been wanting. My husband decided we were going to celebrate our anniversary on my birthday (he had to work on our anniversary weekend). I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went with it. My birthday started nice but the further the day went the more depressed I got. My mom wished me a happy birthday when I  called her the day before my birthday so she wouldn't have to call me on my birthday. One of my sisters posted a video of her kids saying happy birthday on Facebook but didn't call or text me. My oldest sister never contacted me and the rest of my family didn't either (even though my cousin liked my sister's Facebook post). I asked my husband if he got me anything and he responded \"you said you didn't want anything\" (I specifically asked him for a couple things). When we got home my MIL gave my an envelope. I started getting a little excited but when I opened it it was just a couple pictures for my son to color. \nI cried myself to sleep the past 2 nights and I have felt so depressed. I started getting angry and lashing out at my husband. I feel like my birth is nothing to celebrate.\nI told him today that I don't want to celebrate mother's day, I  don't want any gifts on Christmas, valentine's day, or our anniversary,  and I don't ever want anybody to acknowledge my birthday ever again. I can't be disappointed if I know I'm not getting anything and I don't celebrate. He seems mad at me and now I feel like I'm overreacting but I still want to cry whenever I think about it. AITA here?",

That said, we've were raised in a very traditional Catholic home. Our mother would always force us (sister, brother, and I) inside a shitty cramped car every Sunday and we used to hate it. I even remember I got us all in trouble once for licking a page in the Bible as a dare (from him). Eventually though, we all grew up and found our own path to God outside of our parents -- except for my brother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him, but he's always been the testy one. He's the one who would argue with my mother nonstop about trivial things like a bedtime even though she was just a single mother at the time with only the three of us. He's only really seemed to care about himself and his own sense of justice for most of our lives. He  told my mother that he is atheist about a year ago, and she took it a lot better than I thought. While not approving completely, she told him he was free to do as he wanted and that he was an adult capable of making his own decisions. But recently, her birthday came and she wanted all three of her children with her in church, as it happened to fall on a Sunday this year. Only two of us showed up, and you can likely guess who didn't. They got into a massive argument after that and he said things like \"that book is responsible for the death of my childhood.\" I think that's such an overstatement, as we had a much better childhood than we could have hoped for. \n\n  \nNot just that, but we've gotten into near-fistfights on multiple occasions because he's so damn resistant to anything remotely religious. I reached out to him with a scripture after our estranged father passed away and he threatened to block me. I was just trying to help. Then last week, after the whole birthday thing, I told him it'd be better if we didn't talk anymore. I think I'm going to try to convince my sister and mother not to talk to him anymore either, as I can't help but to view him as a threat to our happiness. I'm just doing what it takes to protect what family I have, and he's only given us negative experiences as of late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't hate atheists or harbor any ill will towards them, but I believe that you shouldn't really associate with people that are this tormented. He has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I think he'd benefit from going to church as part of it may be to a lack of God in his life. I'm sure this will get downvoted as Reddit tends to dislike anything even slightly religious, but if at least a couple people leave honest replies, I'd be fine with that. ",

I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

I just wanted reddits opinion. \n\nLast week, my friend (Rob) and I visited Victoria, B.C., and we came back to Vancouver on a ferry that was absolutely full. It was the most popular crossing time back home and throughout the duration of the crossing, the steward kept making announcements to please remove jackets and bags from seats because people have no where to sit. Stupidly, my friend and I decided to eat before finding a seat. Once we were done, we walked around the ferry, all levels, trying to get a seat with no luck. Finally, we came across a row of seats that were empty, with 2 books taking up seats right in the middle. In my brain, this meant that those 2 middle seats are \"reserved\" by someone, so my friend and I took the seats on the sides (aisle and window). We both thought this would be fine, as we left the \"reserved\" seats empty. 20 minutes later, a couple comes by. I was reading, Rob was sleeping. I heard them talk (not English) so I looked up at them and then they asked me why we took their seats. I haaaate confrontation as I have pretty bad social anxiety. I politely told them that my friend and I were looking for seats and we took the 2 that were empty. They are welcome to return to the 2 seats they reserved. Then they told me that they had in fact reserved all 4 seats and that their friends are coming back. I apologized again, but I said I wouldn't move because:\n1. Only 2 of 4 seats were \"reserved\". \n2. There were 4 people in their party, they couldve left someone behind to guard their seats. They brought their food and drink over to the seats so it's not like they just went to eat in the cafeteria area of the ferry. They were going to eat in their seats. \n3. Rob and I walked over 20km that day, I wasn't going to walk all over the damn ferry again. It was too cold to sit outside. \n\nI would appreciate your opinion. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, am on mobile. \n\n",

Nat is a foreign student from Benin and is very intelligent, he is almost 19 and in his fifth year out of six so he skipped quite a few levels. We became very good friends last year because I had some trouble getting into the groove of studying and he helped me out a lot. Over time I befriended some of his classmates.\n\nSo last semester Nat failed his first exam here. I've failed before and its devastating, but you get two chances to rewrite and that helps you in the long run in my opinion, because the learning material is a but fresher in your mind. I didn't find out til the weekend before he was supposed to write, but when I did I played him a visit. He seemed really down and was seriously doubting his ability to pass and stay in the school. I spent several hours consoling him before I had to leave. \n\nThat same weekend my class left for a four week community posting in a rural area with awful connection, I had to walk several kilometers to make my calls. I tried to call him everytime I went which was at least twice a week. He wouldn't know the results til we came back and was seriously stressing over it. Sometimes we would talk about it and sometimes we would joke, but he wasn't his normal self. \n\nAfter two weeks he stopped answering my calls and wouldn't respond to my texts. Because of the mood he was in I was concerned, so when we got back to school another two weeks later I stopped by his room but he wasn't there. One of his good friends told me he went to stay with his host family a bit, so I let him know to tell Nat to contact me when he had the chance.\n\nNat eventually got back to me about a week later and I let him know I asked his friend to tell him to contact me because I hadn't heard from him in a while. He got really angry with me and said I betrayed him by going to his friend. He said that I could always talk to him directly and that he's disappointed I didn't try harder. \n\nI see no betrayal in this. If he won't answer my class or texts and I'm worried about his mental health what am I supposed to do? I told him that but he kept focusing on how I didn't care enough to come to him directly. I realised it was no use arguing with him and apologised. This happened three weeks ago and we haven't spoken since, I'm still worried about him but idk if I really did something wrong. \n\nSo, AITA?",

AN told me that TT had literally asked AN if he could ask me out. I message TT, clarify that I have no interest in \"homie hopping\" and that we're just friends. TT acquiesced, but a few weeks later blows up on me for something random, says some rude shit in front of our friends. Eventually apologized but it was clear why he was upset. \n\nTT and I were friends for a while (about 6 months) while AN and I navigated our increasingly complicated relationship.  We had lots of meaningful conversations. \n\nEventually shit between AN and I reaches a boiling point &amp; things are ended. Shortly after things are ended, TT and I hang out. I joke that I need some rebound sex. TT literally says to me, \"You're trying to get laid, I'm trying to get laid...\" I cut him off there- him and AN are still friends, I know AN had feelings for me, I'm not comfortable getting between two good friends. Besides, I told him we were never going to be more than friends. He agrees. The next day he texts me and tells me he was an idiot for suggesting it; I tell him it's alright, I understand why you brought it up. \n\nSuddenly we stop talking as much. Days go by without communication, when previously we would at least share memes or music daily. \n\nAnd again, out of nowhere he BLOWS UP on me over messenger. He said some unbelievably hurtful things. He used insecurities I've confided in him against me. My self esteem took a massive blow; I cried myself to sleep several times (which is very out of character, I'm not a crier) and I even relapse into self harm. \n\nIt took a lot of work to get over what he said, I was already in a very delicate state because of AN's treatment of me. My current boyfriend helped me trust men again because after those two, I felt like I was worthless aside from my looks. \n\nI've avoided TT since, and generally moved on. Despite my best efforts, he's always around my other friends and I ran into him; he asked if we could talk. He \"apologized,\" by saying he \"was very stressed out about being in the middle of AN and I's 'break-up'\" (which, to be fair, we did put him in the middle of) and I happened to be who he blew up on. I told him I have moved on but I want nothing to do with him. \n\nNow some of our friends think I'm being an asshole, while to me it's clear TT was just waiting for good chance to get in my pants, and never really valued my friendship. They think I should move on. \n\nTl;Dr: AITA for wanting to avoid an ex friend who devasted me and gave me a flimsy non apology? \n\n",

I grew up with extreme trust issues and to this day I\u2019m constantly scared that I\u2019m the odd one out in every friendship group I\u2019m in. \n\nI\u2019m now a Sophomore in high school and I attend a youth group every Tuesday with some friends. These friends are a group of Grade 12s (Seniors) along with Sophmore and one Junior. They\u2019ve all been a group for a little bit and I recently joined in the summer.\n\nThese friends are all really awesome and I\u2019m especially good friends with the Junior (let\u2019s call her E), who is the girlfriend of one of the Seniors (let\u2019s call him C). I\u2019ve known C since I was young, but since he\u2019s older I didn\u2019t talk to him much before now. We\u2019re now good friends.\n\nAnyway, last Tuesday I had a breakdown at youth group. Me and this group were watching Hereditary and someone asked if the dog died, and asked someone to google it, so I did. They all got \u201cmad at me\u201d for spoiling the movie, and I got upset because they asked me to find out (I found out later they were joking). I have a social disorder and I can\u2019t tell when someone\u2019s being serious or not, as well as anxiety and depression, so I took it seriously. This isn\u2019t the first time this group has made jokes making fun of me; C pretends to bully me and I\u2019m fine with it, but I\u2019ve started to read too much into it.\n\nLong story short, I left youth group in tears and didn\u2019t respond to E and C\u2019s texts asking where I went. I later returned after finally talking to E, where she told me I was only noticing the times everyone was saying things about me. I trust and love E and I don\u2019t at all think this was gaslighting or anything, and I think I was reading too much into it. When I got back, everyone acted differently and a lot more gentle with me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve broken down in front of these people. I love them and I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m being a toxic friend and that they feel they have to walk on eggshells around me. AITA?",

I share my apartment with a friend from high school ( each with out own room), but he\u2019s chill with the situation and gets along with her too. There have been no problems with the situation so far, but she does have her own apartment which she doesn\u2019t really use. \n\nRecently we both came back home for spring break, but she went back earlier than I did. I let her keep the keys to my place so that she could sleep there and cook and well chill, I get in 2 days after her with my roommate. This has happened before where I let her live at my place for a bit without me and it wasn\u2019t an issue. Last time she also wanted to have a friend over and had asked me with a good amount of time letting me know. I wasn\u2019t super happy about it, but it was about a week without me and she said she got lonely so I complied. And I would just prefer she used her place to hang out with her friends which is like 3 blocks away. \n\nThe issue came this time when because from what I can tell she was at my place and asked her friend to move her stuff to her apartment to make extra space in the closet for her summer stuff ( we share my closet she was moving out winter stuff for summer stuff). In the moment I wasn\u2019t made aware of that, and I assumed she was alone. She left the apartment to pick up some things and came back saying things with \u201cwe\u201d and I was confused thinking she was alone. So I asked and she said she was with her friend. Then I asked if she and her friend were going to chill at my apartment and she then said yea if it was ok with me. I then told her that I thought it was a bit weird for people to be at my place, but since her friend was already there then they might as well. They hadn\u2019t moved her clothes or anything just gone to pick other stuff up from nearby. \n\nMy girlfriend was upset by this saying that she mentioned her friend helping her, but she hadn\u2019t mentioned when or that they were even together. I was more upset that she was inviting people, and I was the one that asked if they were hanging out at my place before she even mentioned it. She ended up sending her friend home and getting really upset saying that she wants to move out because I don\u2019t make it feel like her home too. In reality I know it\u2019s not a big deal if her friend had stayed to chill but I would have liked a bit more of a heads up than me asking if she\u2019s alone when in reality her and the friend are already driving to my place. \n\nSo AITA for getting upset ",

We used to be quite good friends but I developed a one-sided crush on them, needless to say things became awkward between us and eventually I decided it would be best for us to stop talking, we didn't talk for around 1 year and I figured that was it for us. \n\nRecently he got back in touch with me and we started talking again. Things were awkward at first but I was determined to try and work past it. One night I decided to ask him where he thought our friendship would go in the future and he told me it was better if we didn't bring up the conversation again, that decision upset me though I didn't voice it and instead simply agreed to not mention it again.\n\nAfter that I decided I wanted to see him in person again and we arranged to meet up at his house, the day went smoothly and we played games and then went out for a walk while talking to one another. When it got late I was getting ready to go home and we hugged, though after that he told me I was bad at picking up on social cues, when I asked him what he meant later he told me he didn't remember. This again upset me but I decided not to voice it yet again.\n\nThe next day I questioned him on something. I had previously asked him if he wanted to stay round mine and he agreed to it, the day after we were round his he told me he didn't want to stay round anymore as things were still awkward. I told him I wanted there to be full honesty between us, I was again upset by his actions, this time it was because he had lied to me. That evening he told me that we don't see each other the same in this friendship and that we should stop talking, I've tried to contact him since but I've just been ignored and this whole ordeal has made me miserable.\n\nI keep wondering if I had simply moved too fast, that I should have given him more space and that it was me who was making things awkward. So, AITA for moving too quickly and potentially driving him away?",

A little background, we both live in homes separated by a street, so there is roughly 50-70 feet between our homes. The neighbor in question has a really good base system in their home, which is the problem. When they crank their music up, I can hear it very clearly. So clearly that it is louder than my TV, My Dishwasher, and washing machine; the majority of the time, it can be heard over all three combined. They play this music randomly all throughout the day, sometimes in the morning(7am+), the afternoon, the evening (5-8PM), and late at night (11PM+). I've tried noise cancelling headphones, ear buds (32db noise reduction), and even my gun range headphones, but nothing drownes the noise out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got fed up with listening to their music in October 2018, so I walked over to tell them to turn it down. The nighbor answred the door and told me to get bent. Frustrated, I walked back to the house and let it slide. It happened again twice more, where the music was too loud and I walked over to tell them to turn it down, only the second and third time, I was greated by a different person who seemed nicer and was willing to comply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, I am not willign to walk over there everyday to tell them to keep the noise down, so I finally got the police involved when the incident happened on the 4th time. I ended up having to call the police 3 more times for them to have a car in the area while the music was playing. the music then stopped for 2 weeks, but it has returned yet again (surprise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are no \"pieceful times\" in my county, I can technically call the police and submit a noise complaint at any time, which I plan to do (when it is too loud). Am I being a dick for resorting to this extreme measure to have piece and quiet, given the volume of the music and the space that separates our homes? Also, after so many complaints, the police will start issuing $1,000.00 fines. ",

There is space for about 200 parents in the sports hall, a flat floor (not a cinema), the kids play elevated on a stage, but naturally the view isn\u2019t that great. The school insists in written that no video recordings from the audience are being made, and they provides a professionally recorded DVD of the whole play at an OK price (10-15$) afterwards.\n\nOf course people still take photos, and I get it: you want to watch (or show it to grandma) before the DVD comes out.

They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. When we started dating (She was 15, I was 17) I told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if I am having kids they are going to need to be my own.

We argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. She has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children.

The friend in question is K.\n\nI met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating.\n\nThey saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals.\n\nBreakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours.\n\nOne of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing.\n\nAbout 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out.\n\nI had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y.\n\nI see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week).\n\nI think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway).\n\nA couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns. \n\nI'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care...

The fundraiser card only works in two cities, and the store that closed was the only one of its type in that city. The other city is at least a 20 minute drive for me. Meanwhile there\u2019s another place right on the border of my city/other city but technically not either of the cities listed on the card. They offered me some good other coupons for switching over to their store post-my store closing, but after those ran dry, I\u2019ve been asking if they\u2019d honor my coupon card which they've said yes to 3 times.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been going to this place, getting my usual haircut, which is basically a buzz cut. Everyone always comments on how super easy it is. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s hairstylists commenting on how they enjoy easy ones sometimes or if they genuinely believe it\u2019s a haircut that isn\u2019t worth their time.\n\nDuring my haircut my hairstylist (whom I've had before) gets an insane amount of hair off per swipe and pushes it off my head down the front of my face. Not just once or twice, but a few times in a row. My eyes and nose are caked with hair and I\u2019m having a hard time not starting to tear up cause it\u2019s irritating my eyes. I didn't say anything, since I'm an introvert by nature and secondly, you don\u2019t really want to piss off a person with a razor.\n\nHairstylist says nothing either, uses her fingers to wipe off most of the hair on my face a few minutes later. We finish up after less than 10 minutes and I go to pay with this fundraiser card coupon. It takes bringing over the manager to get the coupon added. I never made a big fuss about it, just explained how I went to the old store, it closed, and would like to use it if I still can.\n\nAfter it\u2019s all settled, there\u2019s a screen on the card reader that asks for a tip. You have to manually press a button to type in the amount and each time it makes a noise. It's obvious if you tip or not cause the hairstylist can hear an amount being entered in.\n\nMy hairstylist says \u201chere\u2019s the tip screen! Remember that?\u201d I unenthusiastically say \u201cyup\u201d and just hit continue so I can swipe my card. Out of the corner of my eye I notice her face pales a bit, but she hands me my receipt, thanks me, and I go on my way.\n\nI really feel awful about when people skimp out on tips as a society. I\u2019ve never worked a tip job so I don\u2019t know how much it actually is necessary as far as their wages go. Am I the asshole for not tipping after my poor experience, even after what they did for me with the coupons?\n\nTL;DR: my old haircut store closed, got good coupons with them, had to move to a new store within the same chain, got a subpar haircut, asked if they could honor the coupon, then didn\u2019t tip based on the haircut I received.",

We were there for the food and fireworks from Noon until about 8pm and afterwards went back home.\n\nBecause we felt we left early, we started a good fire in the burn pit and called over some friends from the festival. Immediately I knew something was off.\n\nThe couple shows up, they've been married for 10 years, and the guy who has been drinking since noon, now has a bottle of Vodka and is drinking it straight. No one else is drinking like this as we're all just having simple mix drinks like crown and coke. \n\nThe guy is 30yo, maybe 6ft and an easy 245lbs and he is going at that bottle. At one point he went to piss and his wife actually poured a little out of the bottle. I later asked for some, just to empty the bottle a bit, but it was no use.\n\nHe gets to the point that he stands up to walk into the house, loses balance and falls, barely stopping himself from face-planting.  I see it as it happens and try to get to him. Well he doesn't get back up, he didn't hit his head, but obviously he was only barely conscious prior to falling because of the alcohol, and the fall was the breaking point.\n\nSo we carry him inside and lay him on a bed. We didn't just leave him, but stayed there and made sure he didn't roll off the bed, made sure he was on his side in case he puked, waited until he did,  but he wouldn't stop rolling around, so we put him on the floor and he fell asleep. \n\nAt this point, it's 1am and everyone is tired so we go to sleep. Well an hour later his wife wakes me up and says she needs help. I ask why and she responds, \"He shit himself.\"\n\nIt was at this point I noped the fuck out and called 911 because that was above my pay grade. His wife was mad because now they have to pay an ambulance bill and for everything for the hospital. Her argument is that it should have been her decision, since she is his wife.\n\nMy argument is that at that point, he was spitting dry, had shit himself, was still not coherent, and I wanted to sleep. I recognized he needed fluids and professional help. I've had *some* first aid training, and I've taken care of people who were black out drunk before, but I was not prepared for this.\n\nSo, should I have let the wife decide when to call 911, or was I right to make a judgement call that he needed professional help. Alcohol poisoning is serious and I didn't want to risk it.\n\nTldr: Man gets so drunk he shits himself, wife is mad I called 911 against her wishes.\n\nBonus content: While at the hospital he started saying another girls name and saying he loved the other girl while still drunk as a skunk.",

I work a normal part time (getting full time soon in a few weeks) job in specialty retail, so we are frequently short on cash after rent and bills. I work about 30 hours a week. I don't drive and my S/O does takes me to work on time, every day, about 30 minutes one way. \n\nI basically refuse to do any house work while I'm home or off, except for a few basic things like emptying the dish washer, vacuuming, taking out the kitty litter trash and cooking most nights. Everything else I just don't feel the need to do, since I'm gone about 6-9 hours a day. I do ask my S/O to do the chores since they don't have a job and are currently not looking for one. They are trying to get disability for mental health reasons, but basically sit at home and play video games or go hang with friends all day. I come home to a really messy house with dirty dishes basically every day. I then clean the pots I need to  use for dinner and cook for the both of us. I understand why its difficult for them to get started, but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with and some effort would be great to see.  \n\nMy S/O also has a habit of taking naps while I'm at work after staying up all night. I find this frustrating because I can't just take naps any time I want while I'm at work and feel tired all the time. I know this is a common symptom of mental illness and one I struggle with as well with my anxiety, but it also doesn't seem fair to me that I don't get to nap all day and come home exhausted mentally and physically all the time.\n\nI bring this up to them frequently and it always devolves into argument where I do get pretty extreme. Saying things like the time I'm at work they should be cleaning and not taking naps/playing video games ect. But honestly if they managed to clean and then decided to play video games after I wouldn't really care that much I guess. I also can go over board saying stuff like don't eat really good food without me. Like if someone is buying them food to save me some cause its not fair, since I'm not usually able to buy food like that on our restricted budget.\n\nTheir side of the argument usually revolves around how they have trouble being motivated due to mental illness and that if they weren't around I would have to go to work and do all the chores myself and expecting them to do it by themselves is basically just demanding a live in maid.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I work, my S/O doesn't. I request they do the chores while I'm at work and this causes intense arguements in an otherwise happy relationship\n\n*I also purposefully left identifying genders out of this so it didn't skew the answers.*",

He knew for a fact that I was just 2 feet behind him.  First thing that came to mind was being worried that he might get with girls that treat him like shit (he did before). \n\nI was at first upset that he chose to lie to me even at the very last moment of the relationship... but later I found out more and more that made me pretty upset and angry. \n\nHe kept saying he did not feel anything for the girl until after we broke up - truth is he\u2019s been talking to some mutual friends about this girl just 2 hrs before the breakup, and it was them who said dude this is not cool you gotta end stuff before you can do anything... so he broke up with me 2 hrs later. \n\nWhen we were together, he always told me he couldn\u2019t make plans cos \u201chis mom makes all the decisions\u201d and he has no say over his schedule (he\u2019s 23 now btw.) But to my surprise, he managed to convince his entire family to go on a trip just to travel to see the new girl.\n\nThen slowly I came to realise that he was never faithful. He once lied to my face about how he injured his knee while I was literally kneeling in front of him, doing his wound dressing for him. He lied about the most trivial things, and when I ask questions he would cover it with another lie, then another. \n\nSo after discovering all that, I found the girl on social media. I told her that he lied to me countless times and cheated on me (made out with girls when we were together). I read what I typed many, many times to make sure it was just stating facts, (i.e. he told lies a lot, cheated on me, and the exact time we were together - cos apparently he lied to his family and friends about that too).  I showed some of my friends to make sure the tone was fine. \n\nAll I wanted to do was to let her know... cos if I were in the same position, I would want to at least know that this person (at least \u201cused to\u201d) treat his SO this way, and to take what he says with a grain of salt. \n\nI was certain there is always a possibility that the girl feels I was talking rubbish, or she might think he\u2019d change for her or whatever. I wasn\u2019t trying to make a choice FOR her. INFORMED DECISION was what I was concerned about. \n\nOf course, his friends and family thought I was taking revenge. They said \u201chow dare you who gave you the right to do that?\u201d I really, really wanted to say, I really don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to talk to her...? But I didn\u2019t. I apologised for making them feel hurt. \n\nMy ex also kept using the fact that I had been on social media after we broke up - dude I wasn\u2019t the one who claimed to not be ready for any relationship??

(Side note: I've probably only used them twice since getting my car, and I did see other vehicle also using theirs.) Eventually, while driving down some poorly lit back roads I catch up to a car going about 15 mph on 35 mph roads. I end up coasting behind them and using my brakes often, but I still maintained at least one car's distance between us. Also, they had been going that slow before I even got behind them. It was frustrating being stuck going slower than I wanted, but I figured they were just driving the speed they felt comfortable with considering the dense fog.\n\nAfter driving behind them for about 3 blocks they throw on their hazards. Now I'm thinking maybe something is wrong with their car? Except they turn them back off again after a few seconds. Finally, we both arrive at a light and wait to turn left onto a wider  road. \n\nAfter turning into the inner lane of this wider road I wait about 10 seconds for them to move into the slower lane because they are still only going about 20 (this new road is 55). They didn't move so I gave up, signalled, and went around them.\n\nAs I am getting up to the speed limit, they start accelerating to match my speed. The passenger then sticks his arm out the the window and flips me off. I ignored them figuring they were just dumb teenagers, but after I passed them they got behind me and turned their high beams on nearly the whole way to my turn off.\n\nIt wasn't until later that night that I wondered if they thought my fog lights were my high beams.\n\nSo AITA for not turning my fog lights off around another car?

A few months ago I proposed, and my Fianc\u00e9e and her mother both wanted a specific family member who is in the clergy of our shared religion to perform the ceremony. I was ambivalent about the idea but kept that to myself and said that\u2019s great. We contact him and let him know are date and he says no, that doesn\u2019t work, in fact that whole month doesn\u2019t work try December (the following month). We pick a date in December and confirm with him. Great!  Two weeks later, her mom lets us know he can\u2019t do that date either, but can do the following week. Ok, we can do that, getting a little close to Christmas but that\u2019s fine. Two months later we get another call from her mom, he can\u2019t do our second date but can do ____ date in November. She says she\u2019s already talked to the church and venue and we just have to say yes. I don\u2019t get a chance to talk to my Fianc\u00e9e without her mom on speakerphone before it is agreed that we will move to the November date. It\u2019s moved, venue is confirmed as is the church, and we are getting quotes from vendors as I type this (no deposits yet).\n\nHere\u2019s the twist. After moving the date my Fianc\u00e9e informed me we are 1 week after my old roommates wedding. Very close friend from college with a guest list overlap of ~15 people. Roommate won\u2019t be able to come if we do this new date, some of our out of state guests will for sure not come (as in have already told us). I feel like we\u2019re hurting our wedding with this new date to accommodate an officiant I have never met and will probably never see again after this wedding. \n\nI talked to my Fianc\u00e9e and we agreed that despite wanting her relative to perform the ceremony it was coming at too great an expense to ourselves and other guests, so we called her mom and said \u201clet\u2019s look at moving the date to the original planned date.\u201d Mom is upset but says \u201cok I\u2019ll talk to venues.\u201d\n\nLater that night I get a text from my Fianc\u00e9e saying her parents decided it was too important to them for him to be the officiant so we cannot move the date. They are providing a significant (read majority) contribution to the wedding and (reasonably IMO) feel they can make this call, though they did not explicitly mention it.\n\nI\u2019m very upset by this. My close friend is guaranteed to miss my wedding and if we like we are being rude to them by bumping against their date. Additionally having somebody else tell me when my wedding is going to be 4 times without any agency is frustrating. \n\nAITA for being upset? WIBTA if I press the issue?

Let's call him A.\n\nHe reminded me of myself in 8th grade. I was an edgy idiot who lived for every opportunity to play devil's advocate and frequently shitposted on 4chan's /b/ board. I think he was a /pol/ denizen (as he calls himself and middle eastern people sandniggers). He tells me he's not racist on the basis that he hates everyone and thinks some groups are worse than others in certain aspects. His definition of racism is that there must be a belief of superiority. My definition is that there must be a belief of hierarchy, I just believe that his version is just a negative hierarchy. I.e. everyone starts at zero and certain groups just go further below zero. E.g. \"niggers\" are different from and below \"black people\". All \"niggers\" are black but not all black people are niggers. Yes he said this. \n\nI wanted to help him dig himself out of what I perceived to be a hole.\n\nTwo years ago, I defended him when he wanted to discuss the etymology of the word \"niggardly\" with a black student in a designated African-American themed house on campus, by giving him the benefit of excusing this attention seeking behavior with probable autism. Although I don't blame the student for reporting this, I think it was knee jerk. However,  he was within his full right because A was a guest in his room. I believe this was their first real and direct interaction as A and I totally go to the room to hang out with his roommate Max or Christian. My backing didn't help much as he was removed from the house and was issued a no-contact directive.\n\n However, his next living arrangement was with a Jewish student that straight up lied to get him out of the room. I explained the situation when he asked why A was moving into the room. He was welcoming at first and offered me a beer once I complimented his choice of beer/talked about stouts, but rescinded the offer in a snarky way once he learned I was not 21. I think it was a dick move, but I dont hold it to him as I wouldn't want to jeopardize graduation in year 3 uni either. He claimed that one of our (A and I) friends was smoking in the room.(against university housing rules, but I believe her when she says she didn't) He claimed that the room was a mess. (We were moving his stuff in so things were on the floor and in boxes) The last accusation was that A made a racially charged statement. (Saying \"Oh you're a Jew?\" when it was made apparent) For me that's a grey area because it totally sounds like something A would say, but intonation is key and determines whether or not it is derogatory. I chose to back my friend up regardless because of the other lies that this person made. Apparently he also filed a police report that couldn't be found when A and I looked for the records. \n\nThe end result was that A was moved to a single room and then given a higher bill because it's a single room. I helped him fight that too because he didn't sign up for it. \n\nLater that same year, he shows up to a BLM protest (that I was helping out with) with the intention of asking questions because he was \"invited\"(in my opinion he wasn't). He was just left on the African-American house's email list so he was sent an email inviting him to the protest that also had tons of information. When he showed up, he is recognized by the student as well as a TA (she was a little nutty but fell into his conversational traps in class e.g. got mad to the point of unprofessionalalism) and called a racist. They try to kick him out, non-violently of course, via collective body pushing. At this moment, he throws our mutual friend under the bus and says that she is associated with him which leads to her being kicked out too. \n\nMy roommate asks me to get him out, but I'm too late. On the way home I'm extremely mad and agitated while I explain to him that this wasnt the right thing to do. He defends his actions with the email invitation. Our friend is emotionally distraught and ends up punching him in the face that night. We both believe he showed up to get punched by a protestor, spencer style. Technically he got what he wanted. However, he didn't report her to the police no matter how many times she told him to. After this, he filed a police report against his TA but I don't think anything came of it. Don't quote me on that. \n\nI live with him now, but he doesn't believe he's autistic. I think he toned down the frequency of his trouble some conversation habits and 4chan browsing. He has a girlfriend without a green card so he stopped taking about immigration/makes fun of people getting deported less. He also toned down on self-deprecating racist jokes about the middle east as his girlfriend is vocally bothered by them. They're both middle-eastern. However, he still occasionally comes to me with things that he thinks I'll get heated about. Our mutual friend steve acknowledges that A does this to him too.\n\nE.g. asking me \"do you think that milk is racist?\" while fully knowing that a group of racists on /pol/ tried to make the act of aggressively drinking milk on front of black people a racist gesture. My answer if you care is along the lines of, \"if you do it to be racist, its racist\".",

Here's the situation I find myself in.\n\nFirst a little backstory...\n\nI met my ex-boyfriend at my then thirteen year old sister's summer soccer league tournament (she turned fourteen in November). He was a few months from turning eighteen and was becoming a high school senior. I was just starting high school toward the end of August and had just turned fifteen a couple of weeks before. His game ended an hour before I met him and my sister's team took the field. He came over and introduced himself. He said about his sister playing on the same team as my sister and we struck up a friendship right there while watching our younger siblings play. We ended up seeing each other on a regular basis after that. We started the school year in August and we really didn't see bunches of each other besides at lunch when we'd sit at a table together but we'd get together after our respective practices (his being soccer and me for cheerleading and softball on the weekend).\n\nWe kept this up for the next four months where we'd do stuff together and be boyfriend/girlfriend. Eventually I'd lose my virginity to him thinking he was such a great guy. Granted we would fight...but it was nothing too serious and any issues we did have would be resolved pretty quickly.\n\nThat would change around Christmastime...\n\nA few days before Christmas break, we were sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch when he said to me about having to go to another city in our state to visit family for Christmas. I told him that it was fine and that we were having family over from out of state and out of the country (Japan) for Christmas. We agreed to do our gift exchange on Friday night and I'd sleepover at his place. We did the exchange Saturday morning before they left to head north. I got him the game Pro Evolution Soccer for his PS4 because he had said about wanting to play that since he's played so much FIFA and he wanted to try PES. He got me a couple of cheaper necklaces and a bunch of cheaper bracelets and anklets (some of which I wear on a pretty regular basis) which I thought was so cute. I left his place about an hour and a half before they were supposed to leave. We texted when he got to where he was going later in the day and we texted and talked on other social media clear up to Christmas evening. The 26th we didn't get to talk because we were busy with other family and I was busy talking with my cousins that I never met before from Japan. The girls and I were up until 3 in the morning talking and drinking 7up and sparkling grape juice in the spa. The morning of the 27th, I didn't wake up until 10 in the morning which is late for me. My texts had blown up asking me if I had seen what was going on, on facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. I didn't know what they were talking about. So I looked at my socials...and my now ex broke up with me over social media. Not only did he break up with me...he blocked me on all the social medias I had him friended on. I texted him and he told me that he didn't want to hook up with me anymore and wanted to hook up with a new sophomore cheerleader on the varsity squad. I was devestated. I cried and was sad for several days. I finally started feeling better around New Year's Eve and even went for a shopping spree with my cousins and sisters and I even got dreadlocks! January 2nd rolled around and we had to go back to school. I was glad to see my friends from school and just wanted to get back into the swing of school. My ex tried to talk to me several times but I kept ignoring him on the advice of some of my closest friends and my eldest sister. Finally, Friday, he decided to confront me asking me what my fucking problem was and why I was being such a bitch and not talking to him. I told him that I didn't want to be associated with someone who only decides to break up with someone over the internet instead of doing it face-to-face. He called me a bitch and an asshole. I continued to not talk to him for the rest of the day.\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to him after how he broke up with me?",

I started to fall for this girl\u2019s personality and looks, also the fact she played my favourite game with me really helped. \n\nOver time one thing led to another and we started a long-distance relationship in early December.

I was going to stay at her home, and she was going to pick me up from the airport.\n\nMy Dad took me to the airport and wished me good luck. Everything was normal that day, we had chatted all morning until I got on the plane. The wheels hit the ground at Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, and I was ready. I get off the plane and text her to let her know I was here. I go through passport control and I'm stood outside the arrivals door knowing that the girl of my dreams is on the other side of that door, heart pounding, anxiety levels at maximum wondering if I'm going to be good enough for her. Nothing could have prepared me for what was through that door...\n\nI find the courage after a few minutes of calming myself down and I walk through the door. I look up and down the line of people, but she is nowhere to be seen. I start wondering if she had bailed last minute. All of a sudden, what I can only describe as the female version of an extremely obese Danny DeVito who had been hit in the face with a shovel comes waddling out of the crowd calling my name. My heart dropped and all I could do was smile and wave.

She was, but she was an absolute professional at camera angles and lighting and somehow managed to maintain that perfect angle in all her photos and during our video calls. \n\nI got home and couple of days later I come up with some bullshit about how I can't deal with the stress of a long-distance relationship and that was my reason for breaking it off.

My backyard has been a mess, but I spent about 2k and 200+ hours of work this summer getting it to be absolutely beautiful.

I really wanted to give it a try because I loved her- but we found we weren\u2019t sexually compatible anymore, so instead of dragging the relationship out and resenting each other we decided to mutually split so we could maintain our friendship. It has been so much better now- and it almost feels like I gained a sister rather then lost a partner.\n\nHere is the problem. We had been living with my parents and paying rent. I had been on disability and could barely afford to live, and then my family needed help financially so we paid a good amount of rent and everyone was fine with the arrangement. They called my SO their family and loved her.\n\nWhen we broke up, we obviously planned on her finding a new place to stay. Sharing a room was a little tight for us anyway and we though more personal space now that we weren\u2019t dating was good.\n\nWe didn\u2019t even get a chance to tell my parents that.\n\nLess than 24 hours after we broke up my parents said she had 2 weeks to get out. I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn\u2019t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out. My ex is really hurt by this- her family was not supportive of her coming out and my family had become her adoptive family. She feels like she lost yet another family.\n\nI tried to talk to them about this and they just said \u2018this is hard for us too\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t talk to me at all. Luckily we have a friend who happened to have a spare room for a good price offer my ex a room so we are moving her out in time, but my feelings are really hurt.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to keep living with us- and it\u2019s their house so I respect their rules- but we paid rent and having them spring this on us less than 24 hours after we broke up really has caused a rift between us. \n\nSo, AITA for being really upset with them? I\u2019m honestly having a hard time imaging how I\u2019ll forgive them. \n\n",

            "input": "36M who recently proposed to my girlfriend (33F). We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. There\u2019s a train that goes into town but most days fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so they\u2019ll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \n\nAll has been generally fine, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30\u2019s especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents back and forth from the vacation home, I\u2019ve suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\n\nThe other day as my fianc\u00e9 and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fianc\u00e9 that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didn\u2019t like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know we\u2019re ok staying on the train. But despite my fianc\u00e9\u2019s efforts to tell them that we\u2019re fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fianc\u00e9 at one point) so my fianc\u00e9 gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fianc\u00e9 tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\n\nThen the next day, my fianc\u00e9 had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousin\u2019s place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fianc\u00e9 messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousin\u2019s to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousin\u2019s as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \n\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s time when we\u2019re on vacation? I understand that some parents will always see their kids as children no matter how old they are, but I felt especially annoyed when I was forced to cut short my time with my cousin who I only see once a year because it was apparently \u201cbedtime.\u201d On the other hand, I am so thankful to have in-laws who accept me as one of their own, as I\u2019ve had ex-girlfriends whose parents didn\u2019t like me for whatever reason and I\u2019m thankful to be not dealing with trying to win approval. \n\nTL;DR: On holiday in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s hometown. Fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are overly accommodating and can come off as controlling. On the other hand, fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are genuinely the nicest most generous people you\u2019ll ever meet so I feel bad for coming off as being ungrateful for their hospitality. \n\n",

Spouse in turn gets frustrated because they think that since I work less and have time in the evenings to work out or relax, I should be doing some of their chores. I feel like we both live here and as members of a household, we both have responsibilities to maintain and fulfill, and while I'm fine helping out those weeks where things are particularly busy, it shouldn't be every week.\n\nSo AITA for expecting my spouse to take care of their chores and getting frustrated when they don't?

But my friends don't seem to understand that. \n\nWhen I first got it, I was sleeping around 20 hours a day. The cataplexy was so bad doctor's though my muscles had atrophied. I could barely lift my arms above my head. Since I was sleeping so much I couldn't eat as much, and I dropped down to 79 pounds (I'm 4'11, so it's scary but not like super life threatening). It's gotten better since then, but it still effects me greatly. A couple weeks ago I was hanging out with my friends and mentioned that the pharmacy fucked up my meds again and that I was genuinely worried about how I was going to handle myself until I got them back. I'm in college and I've already missed a lot of classes at this point because of my narcolepsy, even with my meds. Without them I cant function. One of my friends kinda laughs it off like \"you'll be fine\", another one says \"just drink coffee\". \n\nA little bit before that, I had sat down individually with my friends and told them what to do if I had a narcoleptic attack in front of them, especially in public. I can kinda feel them coming on, so I'm very very good at sneaking off to have sleep attacks in private. Because of this, none of them had even seen me have a full blown attack. Anyways, I told them to help me get to somewhere safe and private, help me take my meds and let me sleep for around 15 minutes before trying to wake me up. Simple stuff. \n\nSo I was real sick of them not taking my illness seriously. They don't need to baby me or anything, just understand that sometimes shit is really hard for me and it's scary. I was hanging out at one of my friends places with some other people about a week ago, and I got an idea. I wanted to see if they actually listened to what I told them before. So I dramatically stood up and collapsed onto the floor (my real attacks arnt that flashy, since I know how to deal with them).  My friends are confused. They don't know what to do, until one of them reminds the others I'm narcoleptic. So what do they do? Put a blanket over my body and leave me in the middle of the room. Fantastic. I stay down for 10 minutes maybe (trying hard not to actually fall asleep) before getting up and excusing myself home. It definitely made some of the people there uncomfortable. \n\nI feel manipulative for pulling this 'test' on them. \n\nAITA? ",

It\u2019s kind of always been the agreement that C was mine and K was his. He\u2019s going on a month long trip to Europe from Mid May to mid June, and I\u2019ve already agreed to watch over both dogs for free while he\u2019s gone, since he\u2019s gonna pay rent for the whole month of May, but not June. I\u2019m planning on getting a roommate mid-May or the start of June, but I don\u2019t know who it\u2019ll be yet so I have no idea if I\u2019m going to have extra pets around or anything like that. When he gets back from his trip, he\u2019s planning on moving straight back in with his parents, who live in a small suburb about 30 minutes from where we currently live. \n\nHis parents have a dog that doesn\u2019t get along with any other dogs so he can\u2019t take K if he moves in with his parents. However, he only is planning to live there until August, so he will move out and get his own place before the semester starts up again. He wants me to keep both dogs by myself until then. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing- K is an extremely anxious dog. He\u2019d get really bad separation anxiety when we\u2019d leave and would bark incessantly, go through trash, destroy stuff etc.  He is also very emotionally attached to both myself and C. He can\u2019t stand being locked out of rooms or separated from C in any way. C isn\u2019t really the same way though, C is a very independent dog. I feel like if K spends from May-August with me and C, he\u2019s going to get very used to that routine and be exponentially more anxious when it\u2019s time for him to go live with just my ex. \n\nSo my ex is telling me that I\u2019m ruining his living arrangements by telling him he needs to take K right when he gets back from Europe. I think he\u2019s being irresponsible by leaving him for so long in the first place, but he\u2019s telling me he\u2019ll come do walks and play dates over the summer when he\u2019s living with his parents. I just worry since they live pretty far it\u2019s not going to be enough and it\u2019s just going to make a stressful transition even more stressful. I love both dogs and don\u2019t want to cause either undue stress. He said he\u2019ll get his own apartment close by so they can still see each other though. \n\nK is also much more hyper than C. He needs significantly longer walks, needs more attention and is generally just more high maintenance. He also has very bad leash aggression so it\u2019s really hard to walk both dogs at once by myself because of K\u2019s outbursts at any dogs we pass on walks. So, I think it\u2019s not fair of him to just leave me alone to deal with both of these dogs when I\u2019m working and taking classes because it\u2019s a burden on me as well. C is an emotional support animal for me so he is calm and easy to deal with. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying he needs to find a way to take K with him once he\u2019s back from Europe, even if that means not moving back in with his parents?\n",

We\u2019re both collegiate athletes, and with sports, classes, social lives, and time zone differences, it became really hard to get the time to talk that we wanted. We lost a fair bit of communication, and it really did take a toll on the relationship. \n\nEventually she started doing things that I thought were counterproductive to her being successful (I know, this sounds like something an asshole would say, but we both took our schooling and athletics seriously and liked to keep each other accountable). She would stay out super late partying on the nights she had big tests, she picked up cigarettes, and she started having guys that she would let crash in her dorm after nights of drinking. This made me uncomfortable and I did get angry but we were able to talk through it.

She relapsed and moves in and out for about a year. It gets to the point where he is paying all of her bills and living expenses. Long story short again, he calls me one night after being bailed out of jail. His story is that he went to his girlfriends \"aunt\"s house to get her some cold medicine, went in the wrong house on accident, they called the cops and he got pulled over later and arrested because he met the description. Now I read the police report because I didnt believe him. \n\nHe went to a known drug house, he did go into the wrong address and almost got shot, got arrested on a felony drug charge, and then lied about it. He also had a large amount of cash on him. He was asked to resign from his job while under investigation. We all knew he wouldn't get his job back. After reading the report and talking to the city manager, he also lied to her about the story. \n\nI should mention, we both work in public safety and I had recently gotten my dream, full time job. After all of this went down, I immediately cut him off. I did not want to be involved in this in any way. I didnt want to risk my job or the way people view me by this, especially on probation. I think I am the asshole for straight cutting him out of my life without warning, but between a fulltime job, fulltime school and the positive people in my life, I felt like I had to. After years of him not taking my advice or listening to me, I couldn't handle the stress of listening to him talk about his money and girlfriend situation 4 times a week whenever I saw him. \n\nAfter about 4 months of no interaction with him, I finally broke down and apologized. I told him I was sorry for ignoring him but I had to focus on myself. What made me feel like less of an asshole was his response. He said stuff along the lines of \"shows you who is really your friend\" and \"I needed you to back me so I could get my job back\". Like sorry man, I had your back through the tough times and YOU never listened, it was always about you. I cant put my career at risk for literally LYING about your past. ",

And they kept asking the cops if it was legal to call 911 on a homeless person asleep at a park because \"It scares me that they are spending so much time at a park where children play and I fear that they might attempt to kidnap my children or follow me home\" \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, we broke up into small groups and talked about the homeless most of the time. I was biting my tongue the whole time because I am sort of an \"imposter\" in the group. Like I am not a religious person/never been baptized or anything, and I'm not even sure where I stand on God and all, but I like to keep an open mind, and i have met some awesome friends though this meeting so i keep attending. But ot got to the point where I just couldn't keep it in any longer. Some woman said something along the lines of \"You always need to be so careful anywhere you go. There are so many terrible and sick disgusting men in this world. The rec center is the worst, but certainly never let your kids go to any trailer parks even if you are having a mommy and me play date. Like if you find out your friend lives in a trailer it would be best to never go to her house. Trailer parks are just disgusting. And the rec center is even worse because theres creepy old men there and the homeless go there to shower and shave since its cheap, and they spend all of their time in the hot tubs and just wait for the perfect time to abduct a child!\" \n\n\n\nAnd I shit you not. There was numerous stories about how the homeless were so scary and its just best if you never make eye contact and just bassically pretend they don't even exist.... \n\n\n\nThis is where I lost my shit. I interjected and let them know that I have spent so much time with the homeless population, and that I,myself, have actually panhandled/begged for money as well as lived out of my car when i was a young teen. I told them some personal stories and tired to show them that not ALL homeless people are looking for an easy way to support a drinking/drug habit, and I even encouraged them that it is totally possible to talk to a homeless person and not magically get abducted. But i certainly let them know that the gross judgement they were making was not only sickning, but also extremely non-christian. \n\n\n\nThey immediately changed the topic but i could still sense the tension, so AITA for sharing my opinion/experience when I was so pissed off that a group of women could be so judgemental?

I moved out of home into a cheap apartment and she decided to move in with me - she said it was to help pay my bills but I think she wanted out of her parents house as much as I did.  Rent is about 1/3 of my wage, and I pay for it all - she works casually and makes probably 1/4 what I make. She pays for groceries and that\u2019s about it, while I pay rent, utilities, and registration and gas for my car. \n\n\nI leave for work at 7:30 and come home at 6:30 most days. When I get home I\u2019m dead tired, sick of dealing with other people\u2019s shit and just want to relax. She has class twice a week and goes to see her family two nights a week, so unless she\u2019s sleeping somewhere else I see her when I leave for work and when I come home.  She cooks when she feels like it and I clean the dishes if she doesn\u2019t make too much of a mess - she gets inspired sometimes and that makes extra dishes that I don\u2019t feel like I should be cleaning. She also dusts, vacuums and shovels the cat litter. We do our own individual laundry, but usually she\u2019s the one who folds them.\n\nOur recent arguments have revolved around her complaining that she is asked to do too much around the home and that the tasks are not evenly split. My opinion is that she has far more time to do more chores and that I\u2019m the breadwinner and should be expected to do less around the home. She has responded to this by suggesting that I don\u2019t see her as an equal - and I have to admit that I don\u2019t. I know her studies are important but she\u2019s currently making so little money and expects me to pay for her livelihood while she studies - wouldn\u2019t the return for that be that she is expected to do more of the chores? Isn\u2019t that an acceptable trade-off?\n\nI want to understand whether I\u2019m being unreasonable, because I don\u2019t feel like I am but our relationship is falling apart and I want to know if this is my fault.\n\n",

Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? ",

I have met the one a few times but not the other. Everything was going well and the party was a fun time until these two new people decided I wasnt drunk enough for them and started pressuring me to drink shots with them. By this time I was at a perfect drunk for myself and didn't want to push my limits so I declined. They became annoyingly insistent getting everyone in the party to call me a pussy and other names and make the whole focus of the party on me drinking this nasty ass rum. Eventually I caved and drank a shot but that wasnt good enough either and these two people kept harrassing me to drink. A few more shots deep and I was at the point of no return and blacked out. I threw up and passed out and felt that hangover for two days.\n\nI know my drinking limits and I am very good at finding the right buzz for the occasion. I dont need to be told to drink and I was very pissed off both at myself for letting them pressure me and these people for forcing me to. \n\nCut to this weekend where I was invited to another predrink and bar night. I talked to Dave and discussed the plan and whatever. We had a two hour conversation catching up and I told him how I felt about his friends he invited and I asked who was all going this time and they werent mentioned. Cool.\n\nI show up and we are all having a good time but then Dave shows up with these two friends of his. Immediately they are on my case to drink. I flat out told them no and they wouldnt let it go. 5 minutes into them joining our party I am yelling at them to leave me alone. Dave knows how I felt about last time and he is just watching this go on and also at points is encouraging them. \n\nThis goes on the whole night. I told myself I wouldn't let them persuade me this time and they didn't but because of that night the whole night I was harrassed because I wouldn't drink with them. They tried every berating insult they could muster to the point people came up to me including Dave's girlfriend apologizing for their behavior. \n\nI ignored it the best I could and focused on making it a good night for myself. Well the next morning they're in one of our fb group chats mocking me even more and I am just done with these guys. \n\nI talked to our other friends and they agreed they didnt enjoy these guys' company and I called Dave and told them I didnt ever want to be involved in plans with them again. If he wants to hangout with them power to him but they're assholes who can't take no for an answer and I asked him to stop bringing them around me. He agreed and I thought the issue was over.\n\nCut to 10 minutes later he adds them to our call and asks me to explain why I dont want to hangout with them anymore.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I felt so betrayed in that moment that Dave would sell me out like that and force a confrontation with these guys I dont even know or want to further socialize with. I hung up on him and then called him back and tried to explain how mad he would be if I betrayed him like that. He didn't understand how I was mad and didnt think it was a big deal.\n\nI haven't talked to him since and we have an event planned this weekend that I have told everyone I wont be going to.\n\nAm I overreacting? Or am I justified in not wanting to see Dave for awhile.",

            "input": "Now I'm not a particularly passive person, if I see something I think is wrong I tend to point it out. Stand up for what I think is right and all. Now when this young girl started working with us I wasn't sure where I stood with her. We have a small workforce, only about six people, so I work in a close environment with her most of the day. She can be moody and very rude and negative unless you catch her on a good day. \n\nNow she's about nineteen and some of her behaviour I put down to her being very immature for her age. She seems to want people to see her as this badass, edgy, straight talking person who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. I suspect she cares. And I've learned after getting to know her better that her home life is not the best, I have reasons to believe there may be some level of abuse. She told her her mother once threw an ashtray at her and punched her hard enough her face bruised, then giggled about it. I told her it wasn't alright for anyone to lay hands on her and she started crying. So I hugged her and told her if she ever felt unsafe then she could call me and I'd open my spare room to her. Since this incident I've been trying to be understanding of her sour moods and have been paying closer attention to her good qualities. She's very funny for a start, though I like blunt and sometimes harsh humour - as does everyone else in the workplace. She can be kind, when she's not trying to act macho, and she's a hard worker too. \n\nWell we were having a cheerful debate at work over something unrelated and this girl steps in saying we should debate other things. Then, in an act I can't help think is designed just to draw attention, flatly states that she's a racist and we should debate about that. We ask questions, obviously, and she comes away with things like \"I hate Pakis. If there's a Paki on my bus I'll get off at the next stop and catch a different one.\" and \"If one started working here I'd quit.\". She also takes the time to clarify that by \"Paki\" (I'm sorry about the slur, I'm just quoting her) she didn't mean specifically anyone from Pakistan, but actually meant \"anyone brown\", namely Middle Eastern and Indian people. The first thing I said is that I think that's disgusting behaviour. She defends her opinion saying that when she was young her uncle said if she misbehaved he'd put her in a black hood and send her away to them. I argued that, though that's disturbing, it doesn't justify her words or actions. \n\nBut everyone else was quiet and my manager tried to diffuse the situation by sort of going along with her. Basically telling her 'yeah, we know you don't give a fuck. Your opinion's your opinion, it's whatever'. She tried a few times to encourage conversation about it, saying that she doesn't care if we think she's an asshole and that she's not going to lie about what she thinks. But after a while nobody said anything, it was awkward. And again, I'm not convinced that she doesn't care what people think and part of me wonders if this is some weird, pathetic trick she's got to try and seem edgy. Either to get attention, bad or good, or to push people away. \n\nI can't exactly psychoanalyse her so I won't know exactly what's behind it. But it bothers me that work is just going on as normal and that everyone is joking around as normal. I've remained civil but I feel bad about laughing when she tells jokes. And the other day she was standing in the rain waiting for the place to open so I let her sit in my car with me until our boss arrived. I had to attend our works' Christmas night out and she danced with me on the floor. On one level I worry about her situation and have started getting along with her, but one part of me wants to completely disassociate from her and only speak regarding work. I already voiced my opinion, I'm not sure what else to do. \n\nSo am I being an asshole here? Could I be doing more?",

During this time I managed to win her back, move back in with her and my son, to then make a mistake and be thrown out again. So I own the place where we both work. It's soley in my name as it was my business. She has helped out, worked with me and my intention was always to make it our business by getting her name on the place too. Well, after all of this happening, she has walked out once on the business before and left me in the shit so to speak, had to employ someone else to take over her role within the company. I moved out, into my friends unoccupied house, then into my own flat. After realising that I can't do everything, I couldn't pay for myself, for my employee, for all her rent, food, bills and all my sons needs, I asked her to come back and work with me. During this time she was working a job that she earnt little to no money and couldn't cover basic needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe comes back to work with me, we manage to make the business stable. I let her take over the finances to which I don't think she did a good enough job of. Unfortunately, I can't get back with her, her decision was made a long time ago, and I had been living with a hope, that some day, maybe it could work. After not really knowing how to approach anything with her, still kinda thinking we could at least do things as a family, which I was wrong to presume. I had a really bad day where I couldn't even function properly, asked her if I could stay at hers and talk and go through some things, which we kind of did. She bascially turnt around at the end and said I can't do this anymore, that she doesnt feel like she can do this and that she doesn't want to be near me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I don't put her name on the business, she will likely leave her position, go back to not working enough and thengod knows what will happen. I care for this woman, she is the love of my life, she is the mother of my our son. She has no one here, no family, no friends. I was the only one and I am the only one who knows her truely. AITA for thinking that I shouldn't put her name on it, take my car back(which i've let her been using for 4 months), take my laptop back(which we had been sharing but it was more 80%/20% in her favour), have a relationship with my son and forget about her and let her get on with things? Maybe she will do it well, maybe she won't. I really don't know what to think",

I've been there for 2.5 years, she has been there for 9 months. Much of our job consists of running programs, driving the bus, and basically being in front of people (seniors and sometimes their families) and running the show. She was born in Canada and only speaks English, fluently (relevant).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday we ran a Scottish Trivia program together. She said she'd read over the questions beforehand. There were about 60 people in attendance, we were up at the front switching the mic back and forth doing the trivia questions. A few times she pronounced words wrong, so I quietly whispered to her the correct pronunciation, because from my point of view it was clear the seniors didn't know what she was talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout halfway through she read the question \"Who is the patron saint of Scotland?\", however she read it as \"pah-trohn\", like the alcohol. People chuckled/laughed, so did I, because it was funny. An alcohol saint of Scotland, hilarious! No big deal. Or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the program, with our door and our bosses door (right next to ours) wide open, she asks if she can talk to me. She says that she feels very embarrassed when I correct her pronunciation doing a group activity like we were, and that she was bullied for it a lot in school and she gets a lot of anxiety about it. I reply saying that that obviously was not my intention to make her feel bad and I apologize. She replies saying I do this all the time and she's very sensitive about it (she mispronounced things a fair bit). I reply saying I only clarified the words because the seniors couldn't understand what she was trying to say, and I was not laughing at her or making fun of her. I offered for next time to go through the material with her beforehand to see if there are any words she is unsure of how to say, and I will help her. She replies saying no, it's just an anxiety thing, I get so much anxiety being in front of people already so it just happens. At this point we get interrupted and our conversation ends there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see her point of view - I know she has issues with anxiety, etc. However, the way I would have handled it (and did, because I pronounced some Scottish words wrong too), was to laugh it off and be a part of the joke, rather than taking it as a personal attack, which it wasn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's had anxiety issues with this job before, and this was the 3rd issue in 24 hours (the first being she had too much anxiety to drive the bus, so I had to drive, the second being refusing to do a lip sync thing for an event we have planned for April, the third was this event). She's taken MANY days off due to anxiety, as in drained her whole sick bank and then a couple weeks on top of that. The majority of our job is to be in front of people and be entertaining - if that causes this level of anxiety, why work in this job at all? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

            "input": "I just recently discovered this sub and thought it would be a good way to decide on something I have been struggling with for years.\n\nEver since I was a kid my sister was always horrible to me. She's 2 years older than me and she would always treat me like shit. Up until I was about 6, I adored her. I always wanted to be around her but she would always push me away. For example, at times she would just be playing on the computer and I would ask if I could sit in the room and play by myself so I wouldn't bother her. Then she'd hit me and yell at me until I would leave. Things like this happened on a daily basis. Eventually, I started having the same feelings towards her. I hated her and we would fight constantly. I've never been a big guy so she would always win, especially since she had 2 years on me. Basically, she made my childhood a living hell. I was also bullied a lot as a kid and she didn't do anything to stand up for me, in fact, she joined in at times. Specifically around 7th and 8th grade, I was bullied all the time because I was really small and a ginger, basically the easiest target there is. Going through puberty while being bullied by not only your classmates but also by your sister was really hard.\n\nTo give a little more background, my sister and I are polar opposites. She's an extrovert, she fit in with the popular crowd in high school and partied all the time. I'm very introverted as most of you can probably relate with. I like to stay in my room on the weekends and play video games. This was always something she used to make me feel bad. She would always call me a hermit and say I have no life. Any time she would get in trouble with my parents, she would try to take the attention off herself by bringing me up and saying things like, \"look at him, all he does is sit in his room!\" I always did that because I wanted nothing to do with her. I would insult her too, but rarely was I ever the first one to say something. I mainly just kept to myself so I wouldn't be her target.\n\nRight now, I'm a senior in high school and my sister is a sophomore in college. Within the past couple years we've tried to mend our relationship. We're on a lot better terms now than when she still lived with us. My parents kind of helped with that. My mom basically had to tell my sister how horrible she was to me as a kid because up until then, my sister thought it wasn't a big deal. When she was told that, she felt really bad and has been trying to get on better terms ever since, although at times she treats me just like she did when we were kids. This has been going on for the past 2 years, ever since she moved out. I still don't like her and haven't forgiven her for what she did to me. I haven't directly expressed this to her or my parents. Whenever I try to bring it up to my mom, she just tells me to get over it, and what happened is in the past. I find it hard to get over something that is still happening though.\n\nI don't want to make her seem worse than she is. My sister rarely treats me like shit anymore, but I think that has a lot to do with her not being around a lot. I don't talk to her often but when I do she's really nice. We go to movies together and talk a lot whenever she's home from college. Every once in a while though, she'll snap and everything will go back to when we were kids. Sometimes I snap too. I've said things that I regret, and I know my sister has too.\n\nI know my sister really wants to be on good terms, but I don't care to. I really couldn't care less if I don't see her for another 5 years. I still do care about her since she's my sister, but I really don't like her. It's a big point of contention in our family. Whenever my sister is around, problems start popping up left and right. My mom says it's because I'm holding onto a grudge. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Recently it\u2019s escalated and became obvious that they\u2019ve liked each other for a while. They\u2019ve been flirting more and it\u2019s on a sexual side now. \n\nOne thing he said was \u201cso you can be my sub and I can be your dom, that makes you mine\u201d. He said this at like the beginning of them starting to flirt more sexually, so it was still new for them. She said \u201cokay but if I\u2019m yours does that mean I\u2019m only yours? because if it does than that has to mean you\u2019re only mine\u201d Basically implying that they\u2019d be exclusive or she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with him, sexual or not. \n\nThen, he said \u201cthat\u2019s where it gets tricky\u201d. So of course she was upset thinking he didn\u2019t even want a relationship. The next day he explains that he has more subs and she wouldn\u2019t be the only one.. he said some manipulative stuff making her believe she would still be the most special one. I don\u2019t doubt he said that to all of the other girls. \n\nFast for award to today, he tells her this: \n\n \u201cWell I'm polyamorous idk if that makes any difference to you but I feel like why cant I make more than one person happy or satisfied  and i just simply feel like I would want to do that with you because it would make me even happier. And because of that the absolutely worst thing and what I definitely dont want is to hurt you so this is why communication with me is super important Idk how I would be able to explain that more but I'm not saying I feel like something is missing from my other sub it's just that I want to have you as a sub that's happy with the way things are. Idkkkk how I could exaplain it in a way that makes sense and its driving me nuts\u201d \n\nTo me, it looks really manipulative and like he\u2019s guilty tripping her into being okay with it. I brought that up and she said she doesn\u2019t know what she wants. I told her how it sounds like he\u2019s trying to justify having more than one girl at once. Especially since he doesn\u2019t REALLY expect them to be all together at once, he really just wants to be able to talk to all of them  at the same time and the girls don\u2019t have contact with each other. He says he wants 3-4 girls. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m questioning my friend is because a few days earlier she told me she really liked him and might want a relationship with him, and how she doesn\u2019t want him to be talking to other girls. \n\nBut now it seems like he\u2019s been slowly incorporating this idea into their conversations and making her think this is what she wants. \n\nMy friend and I have been best friends since 2012. She\u2019s been completely honest with me about this situation with him and even she is getting a feeling that it\u2019s sketchy. But, she\u2019s been getting defensive because she\u2019s liked him for a while and doesn\u2019t want to accept that he\u2019s doing this. \n\nSo AITA for trying to make her see that he\u2019s bullshitting her?

            "input": "So, this event requires quite a bit of background. I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\n\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\n\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \"I'm just joking!\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \"my way\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \n\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \n\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \"there might be some around\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \n\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \"these monitors don't work\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\n\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\n\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \"this is how things work here now\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\n\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\n\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\n\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \"programming\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\n\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \n\n\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\"\n\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \"But *I* wanted a monitor!\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\n\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\n\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\"\n\nMy brother responds with \"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\". \n\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\". \n\n\"Oh, I didn't know that\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \"these monitors don't work\".\n\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\n\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\n\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\n\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?",

After I was born it got a little worse my mom started throwing fits because I was getting more attention than her. Eventually (according to my dad) she would starts fights so she could leave. She would leave for weeks at a time and then one day just show back up for a few days and she would start another fight. Sometime in 2006 she cheated on my dad and had a baby. The baby was taken because when it was born it was having withdraws from something so they tested the baby (and my mom)  both of them had meth in their system so my dad got his name off of the birth certificate and adopted the baby out of the family. The fights kept happening and my mom kept leaving for weeks at a time. About a year and a half later my mom cheated AGAIN with a different person who we will call G and low and behold she got pregnant. My dad said enough was enough and filed for divorce. The divorce happened and my little (half) brother who we will call B was brought into the world (and my mom stole my dads cat). Everything was fine for a while. Until my moms boyfriend (G) moved in with her. He was abusive as hell he would hurt B and I, my mom. G's friends eventually started making death threats towards me and B. My mom started picking up G's habits and would hit me and B (like a lot). So I begged my dad to keep me home. This went on for about a year until my mom decided that she wanted a new life and moved to a different state. I went and saw her the Christmas of that year. After that Me nor my dad heard anything from her. Not for FOUR years. Then one Christmas there's a gift card with a lot of money on it and a big letter of \"how she thinks about me everyday\" and \"how we need to rebuild our relationship\". I called her we talked for two weeks and shes silent again for about a year suddenly shes in town and demands that I see her. We went swimming at a hotel, and had food. Another 2 years of silence and boom another big gift card and another letter. I decided that I didn't want to talk to her because of all iv'e heard.

I swear I have tried, but the experience is 9 times out 10 just immensely boring - and I feel that I need to be sort of \"on my best behavior\" - which is exhausting. What can be frustrating too is that she'll go off with her sister and literally ignore me when I try to continue a conversation with them -- or just hang out. I get that seeing her family is a part of the deal, but spending time with them is killing me and I don't get why I have to be there along with her so frequently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase in point: we went to her family's for Thanksgiving. We were there for the day, awesome, cool, normal Thanksgiving. Then, it's like 7 pm - about time to leave right? Great to see you, hugs, bye - then, she decides to sleep over. She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day. So 7 pm to 11 pm is spent watching fucking America's Funniest Home videos with her family, who I've already spent \\~10-15 hours with that week -- and literally just kill me.

She told me she doesn't know when she wants to leave (read: we will be leaving at 10 pm and the entire Saturday will be spent with me attempting to make small talk and twiddling my thumbs). I offered to drive my own car and leave after the 4-5 hours. Same answer. I can't imagine that I was being unreasonable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole and does anyone have any advice moving forward?",

When we started, *he* was actually *she.*  I knew she was a bit tomboyish and had some dysphoria, but I didn't know it would be so far as to change their name and identity. I'm just not as attracted to this guy anymore. (for the record, I am bi with a large preference towards girls.) \n\nAnyway. My boyfriend, (let's call him Jack) was always really into me. He was a pretty good partner too. Always sweet and thoughtful and stuff. But as wonderful as he is, I've just not been as happy in the relationship. The transition might've had something to do with it, but I feel it's just mostly me. I'm just not feeling it anymore.\n\n This especially sucks because I know Jack has been having some serious mental health problems. His mother (also we're teens, forgot to mention that) has been borderline abusive, being completely against his transition and going as far as to slag him off sometimes, and his brother has been doing the same. His father lives elsewhere and has been having drinking/substance problems, and thus Jack's been feeling pretty abandoned. His school life is bad, he's falling back in his classes and some of his former friends have been incredibly toxic towards him. Basically he's pretty mentally unstable. (And he also goes to a therapist every week.) \n\nI'm worried if I break it off I'll push him over the edge. I know his mental state has apparently been improving thanks to our relationship and I don't want to see him regress, but I'm also just not happy at all. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I broke up with my poor, mentally and emotionally unstable, trans boyfriend?

To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we\u2019re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I\u2019m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn\u2019t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn\u2019t really the point. That\u2019s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman\u2019s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I\u2019ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it\u2019s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that\u2019s out the window lol.

After a few days of this I went up there around 8 (I know, it's not that early but I'm a student and normally sleep from 3-11) and asked them to please be a but quieter because it's an old building and the sound radiates. The guy told me they couldn't be quieter because they had a baby and then shut the door in my face. I went to the landlord who told me I was imagining how loud the noise was. I tried ear plugs but they wouldn't block hot the stomping so I bought a white noise machine. This was an expensive machine and not in my budget but I need sleep. Anyway, apparently they can hear EVERYTHING from my bedroom (which is super embarrassing) and instead of talking to me to resolve the noise they just got louder and louder, meaning I'd turn my noise up higher to cover them. I didn't know they could hear anything until one day it was super quiet and I learned that had left to stay at a friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO this all could have been avoided if the family had been apologetic and a bit accommodating. They could have put carpets down, walked quieter in the morning, etc. Honestly, they could have come to me the first day after I had woken up and explained the noise was loud and we could have discussed and worked something out. Now it looks like they spend all their time banging, slamming and stomping so I end up playing my music even louder to cover it so I can sleep/study. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if the noise bothers anyone else, and it looks like the landlord is going to try to fix the noise going UP to them but not their stomping or slamming coming DOWN to me.

I'm almost 20 and I have to be home by 10 PM or else they keep blowing up my phone with texts and calls. For a majority of my life, I have had to share a room with my sister (until she went to university).\n\nAnyways, as I have gotten older I have been wanting more and more independence. It was only when I started university that I felt like I had more freedom (to an extent).\n\n--\n\nSo, a couple of weeks ago, my parents and I were in the car and they brought up that they were looking to buy a house. My mom said that if they bought a house, it would be for me to live in so long as I give them a place to stay (ie. the basement).\n\nI told them that I appreciate the fact that they would buy a house for me but I would prefer to experience living on my own for once in order to gain some independence. My mom got upset and told me that I am ungrateful and disrespectful for not wanting to let them stay with me if we got a new place.\n\nI told her that it wasn't fair that my older sister (28) was able to experience living on her own/away from them during her college years and they made me go to school locally so I could stay home. I also said that I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of letting them live with me if it were further down the line, but I would much rather experience living on my own/with roommates first.\n\nSo, AITA?",

Throwaway acct. but here it goes.\n\nMy spouse and I currently live on our own in our house and we\u2019re 26 years old and expecting our first child this week.\n\nMy sibling (16) is still living with our mutual parent. I have never gotten along with our mutual parent as I personally feel they\u2019re a hypocritical pile of shit and a terrible excuse for a parent. Always on her phone, does what she wants at all times with no real thought for the kid, and basically shows no attention to the kid regardless of what the kid wants. Nothing has changed since my sibling has been there\n\nMy sibling has some mental problems (bipolar disorder, depression, and a learning disability) that mean realistically sibling should have been given more attention than a normal kid, let alone, the attention they were given\n\nSo basically, sibling got caught liking a person of the same sex a state away and my parent freaked out. Calling sibling a demonic spirit and going extremely over the top with their conservative views under attack. Parent threatening to put sibling in a group home. And sibling therefore has spiraled into a bad spot.\n\nSibling wants to live with me and realistically I know it would be in their best interest because of the situation their in. But frankly, I hate the parent, and the sibling is frankly not very well equipped to handle a job or really any legitimate task due to being taken out of school. But I really don\u2019t want that responsibility of taking care of a child that\u2019s not mine and everything that comes with it, on top of having my own child otw. \n\nSo I feel like garbage, because I\u2019m sure I\u2019m being selfish, but I also feel like it\u2019s not my responsibility in the first place. I was hoping parent 2 would step up (parents are divorced) but I think they are in the same boat I am in (which I think is bullshit because it\u2019s their kid).\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to put myself and my wife through taking care of my sibling on top of my own child despite the fact that my siblings mental well being would be in a much better place if I did.\n\nAlso this is my first post here so I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing things that would make judgement easier, just let me know.",

I've always been very understanding and supportive of that, going out of my way to make her feel beautiful and comfortable in her skin and recently we even started showering together! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, about 4 months ago she got an IUD. Was totally on board, and regardless it's her body and thus her decision. Since then though, there's been two issues that I have not mentioned in hopes that they would either go away naturally or she might notice herself. Firstly, she has been spotting a LOT. Like every single time we have sex now I feel as if I am literally murderin' dat pussy. I'm probably in the minority here but I'm not particularly a big fan of blood in general and still have mental scars from an incident of going down on a girl on her period unknowingly. That's the lesser of the two issues though. She has also started to smell progressively worse down there ever since the IUD, to the point that I can often smell her outside her pants if I get too close and smells kind of like B.O mixed with urine \u2013 not exactly appealing. I do have a pretty sensitive sense of smell, but it's blatantly obvious now and shocking to me that she hasn't noticed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway last night she asked me why I haven't been going down on her lately and I felt as if I had to be honest with her about it. I made it known it wasn't towards her personally, placed the blame on the IUD and how I've noticed it only since then, and tried to play it off like it wasn't as big of a deal as I've actually been finding it. She was still extremely hurt and instantly went to the shower where I heard her crying. I felt like absolute shit for the rest of the night and was thinking I just shouldn't have said anything. This morning I heard her make an appointment to get the IUD removed. ",

Basically, my girlfriend at this point but we haven't made it official. \n\nI'm back home visiting my family so the other day, I sent her a picture of me and my cousins hangin out, expecting her to say something like \"aw that's a cute pic\". But she proceeds to nitpick something about the picture, the details of which are not important to the story. I was a bit annoyed saying these little details she's nitpicking on aren't important, just focus on me and my cousins. This wasn't such a big deal to me, these things happen. \n\nHowever, she said she did say it was a cute pic. So I scrolled up thinking I missed her comment but I saw no such message. I took a screenshot of her non-message and sent it to her. I was expecting her to send a screenshot as well with her message but she didn't. So I asked her to send a screenshot of her message cause I just had to see it for myself. I know it's not really trusting of me to ask that instead of just taking her word for it but that's what I did. She ignores it completely and keeps on with the convo. I asked her again about the screenshot and this time, she seems or acts confused. I told her I asked for a screenshot and she said that she didn't get that message and sent me a screenshot with that message missing. At this point, alarm bells are going off in my head. Is it possible that she deleted the message I sent asking for the screenshot, took a screenshot after that and sent it to me? How is it possible that two very convenient crucial messages didn't go through? One supposedly that she sent that didn't go through (her saying it was a cute pic) and another one that I sent asking for the screenshot. By the way, the message that I sent asking for the screenshot is showing up as 'Seen' so she MUST have seen it right? \n\nI called her out on this and she was shocked and completely plead ignorance. She said her phone's been acting up and that I should believe her over a phone. I should also say that I'm overseas and my internet connection is not very fast. I pressed her a bit more about sending me a screenshot of her initial message and she finally sent it to me. The message that she said she sent (cute pic) wasn't in it. And then she said that's probably because it didn't go through or that maybe she typed it out and didn't actually press send, which sounded like complete bs to me. So after a back and forth of asking her to admit it and her not admitting it and sticking to her story, we're pretty much at a stalemate and still fighting about it. I know it sounds like I'm the one being petty here but the evidence against her is there. I don't put anything past anybody and I feel like people are capable of anything. I had an ex, for example, who would log into my fb account and look at my messages. It might not be fair to compare this girl to that ex but I can't help but operate on my history. Part of me wants to believe her but there is clearly another much bigger part that simply can't let this go. AITA?",

            "input": "In late high school I made friends with a dude one year my senior.  We were friends for a year, year and a half, maybe?  The context of this friendship: I needed a reason to get out of my house and away from my borderline-abusive sister, and he needed some company as his family grew busy and were rarely home.  Though we had little history, our relationship was cathartic, and we'd spew whatever the hell we had on our minds - basically, a lot of unfiltered thinking out loud, without fear of judgement.  From the start, we agreed on one thing: we were both very inexperienced socially, had social anxiety, and in my case the question of high-functioning autism has been raised by several teachers and doctors.  We were to be blunt and clear with each other, ask for clarification when we were confused.  No hidden resentments, no unvoiced objections about the other's rant of the day, etc.  No wondering if that tone was suggestive or not - we would ask, and we would know, and that was comforting to the both of us.\n\nThis also meant there was NO question about what we were.  We were not romantically involved.  Until the event I'll cover in a minute, I didn't think there was confusion even without our agreement to be blunt.  In fact, this was the first non-asexual person to whom I outed myself as asexual.  Whether or not me outing myself is relevant to what happened next, I am unsure.\n\nWe went to the drive-in movies one night.  I didn't have a car or a license, so we went in his car.  We left a little early to avoid the jam on the way out, and he told me he was out of gas.  Like, he was driving on E all day.  This is where shit got weird.\n\nHe wanted to go to the gas station near his house.  His house was WELL out of town, and that gas station was maybe like the tenth on the list of ones closest to us.  It struck me as odd, but I figured he might just have a coupon or membership or some other discount for that station, and since he'd paid for the tickets I didn't say anything about it.  I don't remember if I offered then, but if it were to happen now, I'd offer to pay for the gas (and insist on a closer station).  We get to that gas station and the outside lights are off, but the inside lights are on.  We can't see any other cars in the lot.  The gas station door sits wide open.  He locks me in the car and goes in, and then rushes back out.  There was no cashier, just someone in the back rifling through shelves.  We got the fuck outta there and he said \"There's this back highway by my mom's house, if we go down that for ten minutes we'll find a gas station there.\"\n\nAnd I think, *there's no way in hell we're driving ten more minutes out of town*.  If the gas ran out, we didn't need to be in the middle of nowhere (which - the town itself is just one tier above \"middle of nowhere\").  While I didn't have my license, I did have a learner's permit, and I knew the roads pretty well.  I told him we were better off returning to the drive-in and stopping at a gas station near there.\n\nFrom here, something in my gut was telling me something was *wrong*.  He would not make eye contact with me.  He was very intently focused on the road, which was unlike him.  He really didn't want to go back into town, and he started giving me excuses for it: we could just stop at his one of his parents' houses until one of them came home (in three hours).  We could still go to that other gas station he knew of.  I chalked this up to nerves and insisted no, we need to get out of dark residential areas and onto lit streets, we need to be near town where we have multiple stations and tow options, we need to stay where there's wifi/phone signal, etc., and he agreed we should return to town.\n\n2 minutes down the familiar highway into town, there's an intersection, and despite 1) agreeing to return to town and 2) him taking this route to school every day for the past 2 years, he is in the wrong lane when we pull up to the intersection.  He tells me that there's a cop here and it's too late, he has to head down this other single-lane road that leads out into the prairie.  And he doesn't say \"I'll u-turn\" or \"I'll turn around\", he says \"We'll look down that way for a gas station.\"  He wants to drive down that road.\n\nBut there *is no cop*, and I have no idea where that road goes, and this is where I realize that I might be in trouble.  I am locked in, I am far too small to get the wheel away from him, and nobody knows we are out here.  We weren't supposed to come this way, let alone down a road neither of us was familiar with.  I cannot let him take that road.\n\nI tell him to turn anyway, fuck the cop.  There's nobody else out here at 2 in the morning.  We're not hurting anyone.  And I *yell* this.  Loudly.  Over halfway through the intersection, he turns, and we resume the road back into town.\n\nFrom here, he continues to give excuses to get us off the main road.  \"I don't know this place\", \"this doesn't look familiar\", etc.  This is still the route he would have taken every weekday for the past two years.  It's... literally just take this highway, the only four-lane highway, all the way to the high school, where you turn onto the main street.  It's not a hard route.  I drove it once before this and I knew where we were.  I direct him to a gas station in the middle of town.  It is well-lit, no robbery this time.  While he's filling up I text my sister to tell her we're close to the house (my parents made her stay up and wait for me because last time I was out late, I got locked out of the house - I had no idea if she was actually waiting, though).  When he gets back in the car, even though she hadn't responded yet, I told him she texted me asking where I was and that I told her we were on our way.  My house was also quite a ways out of town, in the other direction - a route he was much less familiar with, but after hearing my sister was up and waiting, he had no more trouble navigating darker, smaller, more confusing streets to get to my house.\n\nOnce I'm safe, I write down what I remember happening for later reference and spend an hour calming down, then go to bed.  And what followed was years of me wondering what the fuck happened.  I cannot stress how bad my gut feeling had been that night.  I am a forgiving person.  I've forgiven and salvaged friendships from worse, believe it or not.  But that night every ounce of trust I had in this dude *evaporated*.  Every instinct I had was screaming *danger, danger*, to the point where I considered grabbing at the wheel anyway and forcing us off the road once we were a little closer to town and someone might stop to check on us.  I almost did, at that isolated intersection with the invisible cop.  Had his weird behavior been because of the robbery (which - I didn't realize until now, actually, that I never saw this robbery; I'm pretty sure he wasn't lying about what he saw inside b/c what I saw outside was also so strange), or had there actually been bad intentions?  If it *was* bad intentions, how far had he planned to go, and what had stopped him until I'd had the chance to contact my sister?  Not long after this happened, I wrote about the incident for a class.  It was a private assignment, just read by the teacher, and I kept the kid's name out of it (this teacher didn't know him, anyway).  The teacher said I was right to trust my gut.  Years after, I have come to the following conclusion, the only one that reconciles the strange events of the night, my gut feeling, and who I knew this dude to be:\n\nHe had no bad intentions.  He didn't go into it with a plan to put hands on me.  I think what he wanted was for us to end up in a house or in the car alone with nothing else to do so he'd have a chance to make a move, set the mood, whatever you'd want to call it.  I don't think he'd have touched me without consent.  But it just... never crossed his mind that locking me in his car and trying to force us first to his house and then into the middle of nowhere without telling me why would be *terrifying*.  It would breach our pact about being blunt, but we did have social anxiety, and maybe he took \"asexual\" to mean \"straight but a little nervous\" and decided a sideways approach was best.  Maybe, once we were parked somewhere, he would have bluntly asked.  But he never got farther than trying to set the stage, because of the robbery and my insistence we head back into town instead.  I am very certain that this is what happened.\n\nHe didn't contact me for two months after that.  He knew he'd done something wrong.  After some time had passed (though - keep in mind I was still processing what happened, hadn't quite reached the above conclusion, still had no idea what he'd intended that night) he asked if I wanted to join him for lunch or something.  I turned him down.  I was terrified of the thought of being alone with him again.  He invited himself to my graduation at the end of the school year, and I told my classmate - \"Don't leave me alone with him.\"  She didn't treat him badly or anything - in fact, they hung out with each other more than I did with either of them - but she followed my request without question.  He rode with me and my mother to the ceremony and we exchanged a few words, but he spoke mostly to my mother.  He was avoiding me, too.\n\nI never addressed him directly about what happened, and that's where I wonder if I'm the asshole.\n\nSee, I was afraid to be alone with him, but this wasn't something I could ask him about in front of others.  I could have texted, but every time I chickened out.  It seemed like a conversation best had face-to-face, like texting would result in misunderstandings and reading with the wrong tone.  If his answer was \"No, I was just nervous,\" I don't think I would have believed him right away.  And if his answer was \"Yes, I wanted to get us alone toge",

That's my opinion, but they think they are helping her.\n\nNo family member has said I'm an asshole or anything but...remembering my regret with my mother, I feel like am asshole.\n\nPart of my brain says \"your an asshole, help/spend time with your sister while you have the chance\" while another part of my brain says \"nah your protecting yourself, she can go fuck herself\"\n\nSo, to the lovely people here, what do you think?

(The old roommate threatened to burn the place down and a lot of drama happened between them. They were both in the wrong though.) Shortly after I moved in my roommates little sister (18F) started staying with us and eventually moved in too. She does nothing to help. And our lease states that there can only be two occupants living here although the landlord hasn\u2019t noticed bc the little sister doesn\u2019t drive. I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s living with us but she plays a part in a lot of this. \n\nThere\u2019s also been an unspoken rule that you clean up after yourself. This is where I\u2019ve had the most problem. Things were fine up until I started dating my boyfriend 4 months ago and left the job that my roommate and I worked at. She\u2019s a messier person than I am but has a \u201cholier than thou\u201d attitude when it comes to cleaning and it\u2019s only gotten worse. I\u2019m talking literal shit covering the toilet after almost every use, a shower that had never been cleaned before I moved in, and the kitchen is always in a state. IE the trash can is overflowing after a day, counters are dirty, and the fridge has food rotting in there for weeks and even months at a time. I\u2019ve been cleaning it all up until about 3 weeks ago. I don\u2019t ask her for anything in return and honestly have given up even trying to talk to her bc she just ignores me when I try. Today I overheard her bitching about the trash not being taken out and also stating that she\u2019s \u201ctired of having to clean up after everybody\u201d. \nTo keep this shorter I\u2019m going to say that I clean up after myself and leave any mess that they make for them (minus the toilet bc that\u2019s just disgusting). We don\u2019t talk to each other and she leaves passive aggressive notes for me.

I'm now with a different partner than last time. I go in for the appt. During replacement, I endure some serious pain despite being pre-medicated by prescribed preventative meds, but still consider it worth the pain.  \n\nA week later, we leave for vacation. And throughout the vacation I'm plagued with intermittent cramps. Not just normal day-to-day cramps. Cramps so painful I cant think, and so painful in my abdomen that the pain actually radiates down my legs and causes involuntary leg spasms.\n\nYeah, having a uterus is fun, guys! \n\nOf course this is very hit-and-miss. Some days I only experience minimal pain. Some days I cant sleep at night because 4 ibuprofen aren't even touching the pain. \n\nWe get back from vacation so it's time for me to re-commence my workout routine: 4 crossfit classes per week. \n\nFirst day back. It hurts like hell. I make a decision that seems obvious: I cant function or perform, so I will skip my workout that day.\n\nCommence lecture about how willpower overrides discomfort, shame about how I wouldn't be able to make up for it later that week due to schedule complications, how \"that shit didnt stop you from an adventure attempt on vacation\"\n(Referring to when we went on a 2 day hiking/kayaking adventure during vacation, during which I didnt have any pain during day 1 and on day 2, on our way out, I had such severe cramps that I could barely stand, but toughed it out while carrying my 50lb pack)\n\nSo, OBVIOUSLY this is a one-sided story, and I dont like that. But that's why I'm posting here: I'm having trouble separating myself from my viewpoint and I want to know if I'm really being a mamby pamby pansy, or if it's a real thing that menstrual cramps can cause pain to a level that exercise is temporarily not a realistic undergoing. \n\n\nP.s.

Earlier this month they asked me to come up and visit and hang out with them on a Friday night. They told me they were gonna get wine and cheese and we were just gonna hang out. I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it, and they checked back multiple time to see if I could come (which I really appreciated). When I got there, I drank one glass of wine but brought the rest of the alcohol I drank with me. I had a good amount of (nice) cheese and crackers as well that they bought. We had a great time and it was awesome to see them for the first time over a month. \n\nHowever, at no point leading up to that night did anyone ask me to buy in or mention what it would cost. I even talked with them while driving to their place and they didn't mention it. The day after, I got a venmo request for over $16 by my friend with the job. I was caught off guard, because I thought they had invited me as a guest and weren't expecting me to pay. I really don't mind paying my fair share, but since they didn't mention so much as a price beforehand I thought they were just being nice. I figured my friend would be aware that I would need to know this beforehand since he knows I am super poor right now. I haven't talked to my other friend who is also in medical school about it, so I don't know how he feels about it or if he even knows the other one requested payment. I paid the request, but politely mentioned that in the future he needs to let me know if he wants me to buy in as well as what it costs, but he brushed it off.

After that I asked if he could write up a note since that day I missed school for that appointment and it's procedure to justify in case a patient is missing work or school. He, insted of helping me, started insulting me saying I always go there and waste his time on useless crap and claimed I was a brat that I couldn't do anything on my own. (To clarify, I'm 17.

However, he asked me to help him study for his remaining exams and, reluctantly, I said I'd help him. I know I should have refused if I really didn't want to, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him no, so I spent my free time studying together with him for his exams.

I brought it up to him last night and he seemed to realize I was right, but was dismissive of the conversation and just kept saying I wasn't right, thinking I was joking even though I insisted I was serious.

So I went by myself. \n\nHe asked if we could get dinner after he got off of work, but then at 7, informed me that he had to go to a meeting and asked me if I could wait. I told him I was hungry so if he wanted me to wait, he had to text me with a DEFINITE ending time for the meeting. (Our dining hall stops letting people in at 8:40pm.) At 8 I went to dinner by myself. No text or anything at all until he called me at 9:30 saying he was getting food from my favorite restaurant and offered to bring me some even though I already ate. \n\nObviously, I accepted, figuring this was his way of apologizing, so I met him at his place and we ate at 10. Well, he talked to me for a few minutes and then went to go play overwatch with his friends. He asked if it was ok first since I usually play with him too, but I didn't have my laptop. Of course I said it was ok, but he played for 2 and a half hours. He is a loud talker, but when he has headphones in he fucking yells so loud. At one point I managed to fall asleep despite the noise and he literally woke me up, said nothing, and went straight back to playing his game.\n\nEventually I told him I was gonna leave because we have class tomorrow, but he made me wait for his match to finish. Then took the longest goodbye. It wasn't sweet long, it was just him staring at me and standing in front of me so I couldn't leave.\n\nI wouldn't be upset if he'd just said he was busy or at the very least stopped making plans that he would inevitably cancel last minute. I'm getting more and more frustrated and I've mentioned it and he'll apologize, but nothing will change.\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend blew me off all day for some reasonable and some unreasonable things and I wanna know if I should be upset.",

SO &amp; I came to this conclusion before our child was born, but neglected to tell her right away &amp; it blew up in our face.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have been considering posting this for a while &amp; am genuinely curious to see what you all think. Even though I'm leaving out a ton of details this is still going to be long, I apologize in advance.\n\nMy MIL is a normally sweet woman in her late 40s, but there have been problems with her that I feel can't be overlooked. \n\nWhen my SO was a child/teenager she used hard drugs &amp; was physically/emotionally abusive. As my SO grew into young adulthood she got off hard drugs, but continued drinking heavily. At this point she has abused alcohol for a number of years &amp; everyone considers her to be an alocholic that will not change. She holds down a job &amp; can function in society, but if she isn't at work she is getting hammered.  While drunk she comes out of her shell &amp; is very gregarious &amp; loud to the point of being sloppy. Falling down, passing out, a usual drunks behaviour is par for the course.\n\nIn the past she's alternated between being openly apologetic of her treatment of my SO to joking about the abuse, thinking certain incidents that are brought up are funny. My partner doesn't feel much attachment to her, or a need to pursue a closer relationship so generally we only see her at family holiday gatherings.\n\nThat is until we had her first grandchild. Then she was wanting to visit once a month. No problem, we were always there supervising any/all contact she had with our son. While I was pregnant SO &amp; I both agreed that she should probably never have alone time with him for all the obvious reasons. Now here is where we I think we messed up: we did not tell her this before our son was born. \n\nSo over the summer we were visiting &amp; got into a conversation about childcare/rearing. Our son was not present so we had a few drinks with dinner &amp; MIL was already drunk when she'd arrived. She proceeds to go on about how kids need to be spanked/slapped so that they don't grow up to be ENTITLED. My SO goes a little quiet. I engage her saying that we do not believe in that form of \"parenting\" &amp; won't allow anyone else to do that to our son. She argues a bit so (this is where I messed up again) I jokingly say \"Well MIL that's why you won't be watching him alone ever then.\" My SO backs me up, subject is changed, dinner is eaten, &amp; things calm down.\n\nThe next day she leaves, cutting a weeklong trip short. Obviously she is pissed. I get a text that basically says she feels disrespected, she want's nothing to do with either of us, &amp; hey have a nice life. I respond with sorry you feel disrespected, not really an apology I know, but although the conversation didn't happen the way it should have both SO &amp; I still meant it. Then she goes NC with us for a number of months. \n\nEventually she texts SO &amp; they have the same conversation. We do not want her watching our son if she will hit/slap/spank as a form of punishment. She then says that she is not here to punish/enforce rules with the kid, just love. My SO questions her though, do you still believe it would be okay? You say you won't do it, but you think it's alright? Yes, she does think it's alright, but promises not to. This is when my SO brings up the drinking, saying in effect well how can you follow our requests if you are drinking/drunk? Can you watch him without drinking? \n\n**This is where she gets mad &amp; states that she has another grandchild arriving. She will have another grandchild to love, to see whenever she wants, &amp; THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED OUR SON ANYMORE.**\n\nAt this point we are done. We're so glad are son is too little to understand what was being said about him by his grandmother. She reached out via text very briefly over the Christmas holiday, but other than that we have not dealt with her. Now she has not seen her grandchild in over 7 months. \n\nI have this nagging doubt that this is all my fault. I feel very guilty because we didn't outline our expectations in the beginning. I also feel bad because I don't want to ruin my SO or my son's relationship with her. I come from family that has a lot of members NC/estranged &amp; I don't want that for my son. Please tell me what you guys think. \n\nI'm really conflicted &amp; want to know AITA here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't really tell anybody that I was moving back (it has been about a month now.) \n\nSo anyway, there are definitely a few people that I've been meaning to hang out with, but haven't been able to work up the courage in fear of being perceived as a loser/failure etc. There's this one girl I know mostly from the internet really but we went to high school together and I've talked to her at the local bars around here for example. We were never really that close just DM'd a few times. I knew she still lived around our hometown (and she is single) so I wanted to surprise her in a funny way letting her know that I was back and maybe we can hangout or whatever. This is where I may have crossed the line?\n\nHer dad was the coach of the boys' lacrosse team when I was in high school so I was honestly probably closer to him than her, but regardless I was able to find their address from searching his name online. On Valentine's Day I went over to the house intending on just handing it directly to her but no one was home. I was already freaked out and anxious from the whole thing and I kept second guessing myself but I didn't want to give up. I also didn't want to leave the stuff in the rain so I tried the doors/windows just to leave it in a dry spot. The window was open so I just placed it down inside on top of an end table. I bought the most traditional fucking gift I possibly could have so I don't know how it could be perceived differently, I just got flowers and a small box of chocolates, and a small card that was supposed to be ironically funny (it was just like a get well soon card) that I wrote \"I'm Back!\" on the inside. I was planning on messaging her saying it was me at like 6, figured she would be back from work by then. \n\nFast forward a little bit that day, watching her instagram story she was NOT amused and definitely a little freaked out from what I could tell. I honestly just thought it would be funny but now I am afraid to tell her it was me, does that make me an asshole? I just want this whole thing to disappear.",

            "input": " Hello. I know this is a pretty mild one compared to the others but who better to ask than reddit.  \nMe and my boyfriend have been sharing food, since we live together for 1,5 year now. We always split the bill in 2 and we usually determine who's gonna shop for groceries by who is going to be near a shop that day. Well.. almost. I am usually the one who makes that effort, which takes time and time is important to me as a student, he usually just deflects that responsibility by \"we don't need anything\" or \"I don't want to go today\".  \nI am also the one who cooks the food and he usually cleans the dishes even though sometimes he complains that it takes longer to clean it.  \nAnyway, we went to a grocery store recently and we usually just split, I buy what I need for cooking and he buys snacks or if I tell him to get something he will. I asked him how much milk should I buy when he hits me with \"I don't want milk\". As I know he loves milk and eats it with cereal/ drinks it with chocolate sugar, I am confused by this but just proceed to buy one carton for myself.  \nThat day I decide to have milk for dinner so I pour myself about 1/5 of the carton and have some cereal with it. The next day he asks me whether he can have some for his chocolate milk, I raise my eyebrows and comment something about him saying he doesn't want and tell him sure. That day was pretty full for me and I only got around coming home around 7pm and after only eating breakfast I was pretty hungry and wanted something quick to eat. So again I decide on milk and cereal. But of course there is no more milk.  \nI go to him ask him where it went he said he drank it, which irritated me cause he did not ask me if he could,I was hungry and he specifically said he doesn't want any, I mildly irritated said \"then you will have to go and buy me some\". We live in a dorm and there is a small shop here where you can buy some groceries and is just 11level away, and buying some milk takes literally max 7 minutes, but of course it's a bit more expensive.  \nHe hits me with \"maybe\" and proceeds to play LoL and ignoring me. I get even more irritated, raise my voice and say \"you better go buy that milk\" and just let him play and wait until he finishes the game.  \nAfter waiting on him for 20 minutes I start calling for him \"Boyfriend, go buy me that milk I am hungry. Hello? Boyfriend? Boyfriend? Hey?\" cause of course he acts like he doesn't hear me now.  \nI throw my bra at him which catches his attention he puts down his speakers and he starts \"maybe if you asked nicely\".  \nWow. Am I in the wrong for getting absolutely pissed off at this? I asked him whether he wants me to plead him to go buy me the milk he drank and said he doesn't want in the first place and after some deflections of his I get very angry and start yelling at him how lazy and selfish he's being. He said something about me always getting angry and never saying \"please\" and that he was \"very close to going but after you acting like a bitch I am not\".  \nI don't think I should be pleading him to go buy me something he took from me. If it was me drinking something of his I would go buy him a new thing without him even asking. Or should I have been nicer?  \nHe always does something like this, that when he is in the wrong and I call him out he turns it around on me and I end up being the bad guy. Last week he wanted me to wear these high heel to go eat out with him, he knows I cannot walk in high heels, he knows my shins hurt when I walk in high heels for a while, he knows the shoes we got from aliexpress are too small for me and he still wanted me to walk in them for at least an hour in Prague(if you ever been to the city center you know what kind of walking areas are there in Prague), raining and cold outside. I told him I won't and that is a bad idea at which he said I promised I would wear them and completely turned the situation on me, despite him wanting me to be uncomfortable in order to get me to wear the shoes he likes (way too much).  \nDo I just have anger problems?

We don't go out all that often and so I was really looking forward to it however, my friend kept texting me about his problems while I was out, and he was expecting me to answer and be his therapist for a couple of minutes.\n\nI would often suggest he get professional help. He'd say he would use the resources I provided him but then he would come to me about two days later with issues again. At some point, I kind of just stopped replying all that much. this started the posts and spam messages. he would constantly send out posts about being so depressed, anxious, how he was good for nothing, etc. then when I wouldn't answer, he'd text me stuff like:\n\n\"hey, it's been awhile, are you okay?\" note: I wouldn't be gone for long; about two days or maybe 6.

A bit confused, try to pry out what's wrong, but just silence. After a few minutes she asks me do I really not realize how rude I just was. I am still not 100% sure what I was rude about, but obviously something to do with me tasting her beer.\n\nConclusion:  Giving me cold shoulder for rest of the night, maybe 10 words exchanged max. Next day similar, again brings up that I was rude. I disagree. Me best guess is it's not that I had a sip as we share food all the time (see water above), but maybe it's because I had the first sip especially since it took so long to get to the table. I don't believe this exact argument has come up before in the 13 years, but she has expressed annoance if I try to eat off her plate at the same time as she has a fork in her own plate (so fine sharing as long as I am not disrupting her creating a \"perfect bite\") AITA for taking the first sip or overreaction on her part?

            "input": "I am team leader of an Airsoft team. We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n",

My parents just got divorced, and are currently living at separate addresses. I wrote two pages to my dad about how much he\u2019s taught me, how I\u2019m who I am to him, everything you would expect. I had some friends and even my favorite teachers to read over it to make sure it was perfect, and I ended up making My english and anatomy teacher well up, along with a few classmates cry. I poured my absolute heart into this letter. I turned it in with confidence that I said what I wanted my dad to know. After all, I love him to death.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: I didn\u2019t write anything for my mom. I didn\u2019t want to. I couldn\u2019t stretch to write a paragraph, much less a page. I wouldn\u2019t budge to fake it, or write some generic garbage as a nice gesture. I don\u2019t know if it was bitterness, spite, or just negative parts of our relationship taking focus of anything I was thankful for.\n\n My dad received his letter Thanksgiving day, and he loved it. He asked if he could show his friends how great his son was and whatnot. My mom didn\u2019t get anything that day. To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know about the letter and she doesn\u2019t know that I couldn\u2019t write half a page of nice things about her.

We've had her for about six years now. When we originally got her, it was my mother's idea. The dog, let's call her Megatron, was extremely disobedient the first year. Constant shitting in the house, ate our food, harassed our cat of 10 years. My mother talked all the time about how pointless and hopeless this dog was, how she would give it away the next month if things didnt change. It was just a puppy doing puppy things. She didn't seem to understand that training dogs takes a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur other, much more well behaved dog, beloved by my mother as almost another child, died about three years ago. She was understandably heartbroken as we all were. A great dog. He was about medium sized, so she not soon after started looking for another medium sized dog. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to two years ago and she went to the local pet store for some dog food for Megatron. She comes back with this large puppy, about the size of a medium sized dog. Completely rash decision. I am not aware of the hurricane that is to come so am initially excited and supportive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMegatron is not spayed/neutered, keep in mind, so she is extremely territorial of this new dog. She immediately does not jive with it and it sucks. He wants to play, Megatron wants to fight. The house is constantly a canine battlefield. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe puppy is extremely difficult, added challenge of him already being the size of a medium sized dog. He breaks out of his cart, tears up carpet, eats food from the kitchen, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and stepdad are leaving for somewhere, so they ask me to watch the house while they're gone and make sure that the puppy and Megatron get along. Two problems: \n\n1. I have a historic phobia of dogs, and dog conflict makes me very anxious. She was around to witness this development in my early years \n\n2. I am an extremely anxious person. I have at this point already made clear to her that I was going through a period of immense mental difficulty, as I developed a severe panic disorder out of no where. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo absolutely no ones surprise, shit hit the fan. The puppy immediately began causing problems. Chewing things up, getting aggressive with Megatron, scaring the cat. I called my girlfriend over to help calm me down. I was playing computer games in the living room to distract me. Dog ate my only mouse. My girlfriend leaves to get me a new mouse because shes amazing and I was worried about not having one that night as using my laptop is part of my relaxation routine. When she comes back, dog eats her new vans she just bought. When she tries to get them back, dog bites her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire time I'm having an extreme panic attack, Megatron is very uncomfortable, cat is hiding, my girlfriends pissed. My mom never took responsibility for anything that the puppy destroyed. She never got me a new mouse, my sister new shoes. When I told her about it, her response was \"That's what happens when you get a puppy\". I firmly believe that it isnt what happens because it's not my puppy, it was hers. She knew the difficulty of this dog, she knew my anxiety would skyrocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is, the puppy was too much for her too. She put it up for adoption in a shelter, again. Poor dog now has to wait twice for it's owner, because my mom didn't have the responsibility for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow shes telling me, tonight, she has her eyes on this new female puppy, three weeks old. I start off like I don't believe shes serious, but my younger sister of course feeds into this mess, because she of course never had to take care of the previous dog, or will this new one likely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell her \"I'm not babysitting this one\" which she responds \"I never asked you to\". I said \"You did the last puppy and that went horribly\" and she says \"Well you live here, you might have to.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of bunked if you ask me. I am a college student with a job that only gets me 16 hours a week avg. I like the hours because I'm still very much contending with my anxiety problem. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't been easy to work around. I'm making some progress in some areas, but I'm also experiencing new psychotic symptoms lately such as slight hallucinations and paranoia. Shes never been good at supporting my anxiety, so I've gone this journey alone save my father and girlfriend. Therapy has been expensive and hard to find. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's necessary to mention that because I'd be much more willing to help with the dog if I hadn't already so much reason to worry. It's her house which I am lucky enough to live in rent free, so long as I stay in school. It's her life, she can get a puppy if she wants. I won't even try to stop her, that's just not right of me. But I feel like I have the right to refuse to help take care of it, and express my general concern as to why its a horrible idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom historically bad with puppies. First puppy we barely kept and is now a great, small dog. Mom expected me to participate for this second, large puppy which went to shit, destroyed me and my girlfriends things, set off my anxiety disorder to all hell, and she refused to take responsibility for it. Got put up for adoption. Now she wants another new puppy which we all know will not jive with our first dog, and she also expects me to take responsibility for it. ",

My mom picks me up at this spot, Terry and I laugh it out, but my mom See's this. as I get in the car with Terry (as he needed a ride) my mom tells Terry, \"Don't do what you don't want other's to do to you\" in Spanish. Terry does not understand Spanish, but Kent most likely does. As I walked into the car, Tyler Tells me what is going on. as a teen, I don't like other's standing up for me, I'm 14, not 5, we know the boundaries. I tell my mom, it was a joke, hoping for her to understand. Instead she and I have an argument where I try to explain my side. This goes on with how you expect it to, my mom argues that I can't let myself Be taken \"bullied\" of like that, while I tell her it was a joke, while Tyler is next to me is laughing quietly. After Tyler leaves at his house, me and Mom argue worse than before, since Tyler left, I was able to say things to my mom like, \"I hate it when you think I'm five\" and she would talk about how \"Tyler should have heard this to know that you're not comfortable with being pushed around\" I'm pretty mad at this, because I know that it's pure jokes (it's really just jokes).  This goes on and on, She treats my argument Like a joke, so when I brought up points like how when Kent sprayed ketchup on me on accident, he apologized. all she replied with was \"Uh huh\" and never acknowledged it, but It was just an accident. Even worse is my dad told me that it would escalate from accident, into a fight. I explained the generosity of my friends, and how they say sorry, he said that's a lie. We argued, I tried being serious to my mom about it, by telling her I'm not a child anymore. she didn't take me seriously. They think I can't defend myself at all, although they're just trying to protect me.  Am I the Asshole?",

Fair enough, we agreed. The only day before the photographer left for the holidays was the day our plane landed, and I was fairly grumpy. Long flight, no sleep, and I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time so I was just sick and cramping. The photographer and his assistant knew all of this. I was bloated, and my wedding dress didnt fit me properly, so it was unzipped in the back and I had a wrap on to hide that fact so I was feeling pretty shitty about myself. After couples photos, the photographer wanted individual shots of my husband and I. I get into a pretty generic photo pose, and smiled. They ask me to move my arm a certain way, tilt my head, whatever. I guess I wasnt doing it right, because the assistant came around and started grabbing my arms, tilting my head, kind of shifting me around for the position. I'm really irritated at this point, and I huff while shes positioning me around. Then she says \"Come on, dont you want to look thin and pretty?.\" Which set me off. I dont like being touched by strangers, I dont like taking photos, and I've always been self concious about my weight and pregnancy wasnt helping that, on top of a long flight and no sleep, so I snapped. I told her \"I don't need to look thin and fucking pretty. I'm not a fucking barbie doll, so keep your hands off me. I'm fucking done with this bullshit.\" and I stormed upstairs to the guest room (we were at my MIL's house) I was crying, my husband talked to his mom for a second then came upstairs to comfort me. I changed into comfy clothes that actually fit and after a little while I went back downstairs and apologised. We finished taking photos with everyone in comfortable clothing instead of their Sunday best, and no individual shots of me. The assistant was a bit colder towards me than she had been earlier, but she was still polite. I still feel like a huge dick about the fit I threw. So, I come to you and await your judgement.

We started hanging out, watching movies together, talking etc...\n\nSo one day we go out with our classmates to a pub and I don\u2019t drink much but she gets completely drunk. Since she lives really far away and there\u2019s no bus at that time of night, I offer her to come to my place and sleep it off. She does come and I do my best to be a decent host, making her a bacon and egg midnight snack and getting her room ready.\n\nThree weeks after that we go out again, this time to another student\u2019s place and then to a club and, this time, we planned for me to come back to her place. Since that night she has been avoiding me so I must have fucked up in some way, I just can\u2019t figure out how. Here\u2019s what I did :\n\n- I hit on a guy and left her w one of her friends for about one hour but we met again at the club and I left the guy behind, she didn\u2019t seem bothered by that since she was w other people we knew.\n\n- I got really (REALLY) drunk during the night and ended up being sick on the way home. I\u2019m not an annoying drunk, I\u2019m the \"super honest and affectionate\" kind but I was really fucking plastered and she wasn\u2019t.\n\n- I can\u2019t remember maybe 20-30mn of that night so I might have done something then?

We were so proud of the BIL and his family for trying to stay off drugs and working to move them out of rehab.

Instead, he moves in with his father (my FIL) and they start smoking.  Years of rehab down the drain.  It was like all the support we gave him didn't matter.

My mom is only disabled to the point where she has a severe limp, nothing affects her mental ability or upper body. She is also overweight.\n\nShe is always late. Always. \nExamples:\n\nOne Sunday (switch day), my mom offered to drive me and my siblings to my dad's house a few hours early. We had gotten a few inches of snow the night before, and all my best friends were going sledding. She said she would give us a ride if we cleaned the house. Me and my 2 sisters cleaned the entire house, top to bottom, for about 3 hours, and we were ready at about 11:00. \n\nMy mom said she would drop us off right after she made lunch for us. We don't normally have a sit-down lunch, so I was not expecting to have one, especially when we had plans. Sundays are usually fend-for yourself days. I was expecting her to just heat up some pizza or something fast like that. \n\nI texted my friends, after confirming with my mom, that we would be there around 11:30. Keep in mind, she AGREED to 11:30. \n\nSuddenly, I hear sizzling from the kitchen. I look in, and I see my mom cooking salmon on the stove top. I ask her what, and she replies \"I'm making lunch for the boys (my 2 younger brothers, 9 and 6). \n\nThey are pretty used to being home alone, and it would have been only 30 minutes.\n\nShe continued making lunch, and at 11:45, she had made 6 plates of salmon, rice, and mixed vegetables. She called us all, and seemed very confused when we didn't want to sit and eat with her. At this point, we were already 15 minutes late, and eating lunch and cleaning up would have taken at least 30 minutes. I was thankful that she made such a nice lunch, but I really wanted to go and hang out with my friends. \n\nDespite our protests, my mom, my 2 brothers, and 1 sister sat down and ate. It took 45 minutes for them to finish. \n\nWhen they were done, my mom went on to go to the bathroom for 15 minutes and we finally left at 12:45, and didn't get there until 1.\n_______________\n\nSo, I last week, I had a 4 day field trip, and we had to be at the school at 6 AM to catch the bus. Knowing her, I told her we had to be there at 5:30 to get the bus, so we would (hopefully) get there on time. \n\nWell, she found out, and started asking me why. I responded truthfully, and she started screaming at me. She said she's \"trying her best\" and \"she can't be perfect\" and \"just accept me\". I tried to have a reasoned discussion, with her, but she wouldn't listen.\n\nI got my dad to drive me there **on time**, by the way.\n\nSo, AITA for being annoyed at her like this?

Once we got serious and moved in together this never stopped. She'd defend it as \"well it's my money!\" but then use the money I made to cover things like dinners and outings.  \n\n\nCurrently we're back in the United States and making more money, but she's sending a solid percentage of it back. We're at the point where we're really just making enough to cover our expenses and not paying off the credit card debt we accumulated from starting our lives here in the US. All of the money I make goes to our credit card (which we still use), health insurance for both of us, and retirement. Since we are waiting for her degree to be evaluated she hasn't started her career yet and is working jobs that don't come with benefits, so our pay checks are about the same after my deductions. She sends approximately 200-300 dollars per month which I feel we should be putting in retirement, paying off our credit card, or moving out of our shoe-box apartment.  \n\n\nMy frustrations also stem from her family there. We help her mom with some spending money and purchase medicines for her, which I am absolutely 100% on board with, her mom sacrificed a lot for my wife to be able to attend college and deserves all the help we can give. My issue stems with two of her brothers. The oldest brother is \\~30, didn't finish high school, has never had a job other than driving a motorcycle around for a few months as a taxi, is covered in tattoos which is a big cultural no-no over there, and has an elementary aged son. He, his son, and his girlfriend live in the house my wife purchased rent free. I feel that at his age there's no reason for us to support him, that we're making it too easy for him to exist doing nothing and we're going to be stuck taking care of him forever. I've turned numb to \"medical emergencies\" and any other reason they need money.  \n\n\nHer other brother is a college student, very smart guy and lives at home with us as well. We pay his college tuition which is dirt cheap \\~250/quarter  I'm totally cool with him living rent free in the house there and I can grin-and-bear paying his tuition because it's so cheap, but part of me also feels that I'm $80,000 in debt for my university studies that I'll be paying on for a long time, why can't he go $4000?  \n\n\nI understand the culture is different, I understand it's her family and she loves them, but I see the money she spends on them as depriving us of moving forward and establishing a better future while money is still tight.  \n\n\nAITA?  \n",

We've been married about 8 years. More importantly, I don't know what perspective is the healthiest to take on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: tonight, my wife (47), mother-in-law, son (5) and I (45) are getting ready to have dinner. Like the previous poster, I do enjoy cooking; I like to experiment and hate using recipes. Sometimes, I lose- big time, but usually, I can do a pretty good job of making something delicious and healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, about a year ago, my son (5yr) was diagnosed Celiac, and about 6 months after, I figured out that my 30 year gut problem is an IBS caused by onion, garlic, and all kinds of other foods containing fructans. Those foods containing gluten (a protein) also have these fructans (a sugar), so wheat, barley, rye- my son and I both get hit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think my problem goes beyond serious, explosive, burning, toilet discomfort for a couple days, but my son truly will have problems if he ingests more than a sugar packet's worth of gluten in a year (put your knife in peanut butter, wipe it on your 'regular' bread, go back to the peanut butter jar with the knife, guess what's now in the peanut butter- whatever kind of bread you spread it on next).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about my son's celiac, I cleaned the house of gluten. Anything remotely suspect, I put in boxes intending to give away. Wife came home; within an hour most everything was back on the shelves. Perhaps I over-reacted, I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 8 months. We now often just prepare three meals for dinner. My son, being five, well he'd likely get his own meal in any case, not just because the gluten thing, but also, he's five.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife though, she insists on buying both regular and gluten-free, well just about everything.  So, we have gluten, and gluten-free peanut butter, gluten and gluten-free butter, gluten and gluten-free breads. Still gotta use the same toaster and all though. She made pizzas the other day using her bread-maker. One gluten-free pizza for the boy and I, a 'regular' one for her and our guests. Using the same bread-maker she'd been using for years. A sugar packet's worth of the gluten molecule, remember. But maybe I'm over-reacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway- things are settling to where I cook meals and my wife does dishes/cleanup (I hate dishes- hate it- and I do it 'wrong' anyway too often). She'll still make meals occasionally too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my wife has a thing with beef- I can't pin down her reason though, because it often changes. For years, the reason was that cows produce methane, take up too many resources, bad for environment, etc. But then I pointed out her milk drinking habit, and the fact that there were more buffalo in North America before the slaughter than there are cows now, and that they share a similar physiology, etc. So now her reason seems to have switched to that it 'makes her feel bad'. Though I still hear the environmental piece from time to time. She has no problem with other meats- birds, pigs, fish, not much a fan of lamb or goat though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she'll eat the beef pot pies her mother makes. And she'll eat beef other times at her parents' house, or at other's houses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, I go to make dinner for myself, my wife and my mother-in-law.  I decided to season some ground bison (having this onion/garlic thing, I've got to create all my own seasonings from scratch- EVERY seasoning mix has onion or garlic powder). Then I put it over rice and made a tomato-cucumber-corn salsa to put over top of that (because, again- I defy you to go find a salsa without onions or garlic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's good- it's really, really good. But my wife won't have any of it. Because I used the bison ground beef. She said last time she tried it, she had too much and it made her feel bad.  So instead, we just get in each other's way in our cramped kitchen while she prepares an entirely different meal using nothing I had prepared tonight except the rice. The meal she decided to have was my leftover veal-tomato-sweet potato crock pot disaster that I don't intend to have another bite of myself, I'm so disappointed with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, when the meal was over, my mother-in-law said, 'Thanks, that was good.'. And I said, 'Thanks, I'm glad somebody enjoyed it.\" My wife said, \"You didn't like it?\" I said, \"No, it was great!\".  She again said something about how last time she tried the bison she, 'Didn't feel good'. Then she proceeds to take another bite of the vegetables she'd picked out of the crock pot veal leftovers. Knowing full well that veal is cow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of behavior, is regular. When she makes me salads with the bitter, yucky plant leaves I just don't like, I eat them. I might complain a little, but I don't just make my own meal instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo folks, AITA for sitting here feeling bad because I live in a family that has to have three separate meals on a regular basis? Is this any different than the previous poster's situation with his fiance? Should I do more to cater to her choices of food items, when my son and I have diagnosed medical problems associated with foods that she refuses to adapt her own eating and grocery habits to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease ask for clarifications if you need them- I'm not looking for validation here- I really don't know if I'm an asshole or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Wife prefers not to eat beef. I make family meals and will use bison or beef (usually bison if I can find it) maybe once a week or every other week, but my wife won't eat it and just makes her own meal instead. My son and I have diagnosed/medical food issues, but she brings the offending foods home anyway. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've had a job 3 YEARS, and he want's to kick me out because I want to go back to work. I have a ride there and back, he has to do nothing to help me get there. It affects him in no way.\n\nI have been given set rules, be home by 12 ect.. I follow them. A rule was get a job, I've got ALOT of court fees coming up. I HAVE a job. I have HAD IT 3 YEARS, and I make GOOD money, and these people are my family. My manager has worked with me these past two weeks since the event, keeping my name on schedule, and open to ANY shifts I can make it too. She wants to help me no matter what and has left my name up, even when I went to jail for 3 days, she simply told me she's glad I'm okay. My grandma wants to bring me to work in the morning, and I will always have a ride back. This is only Tuesday and Wednesday. Two days a week from 9:30 to 5. Any other job, and I am getting a second one here like he wants, is going to be a bus commute and me asking for rides and figuring out what to do, and waiting to be hired and I'm okay with that.\n\nBUT. This job is solid, and I'm guaranteed to start working immediately and have income. My dad is saying he will kick me out if I choose to work here. He claims it's his rules and to my grandma he is \"helping her, and she needs to be humble follow my rules and listen too me.\" There's no real reason.They aren't home then. They don't have to take me. It affects them in no way. My own grandma is against him in this, her son. Helping me would be letting me go to work, not taking away a job I've had three years. My attorney even said I should maintain this job.\n\nI had to call my manager tonight, to tell her I can't go in tomorow because of this, and he SCREAMED AT ME in the background, she heard, and she was just trying to go to bed. It was awful. I told her I'll call her tomorow. I told him earlier in the day I was going to work, and he didn't say I couldn't. He didn't act this against it, UNTIL my step mom stepped in. Then threatened him. She took the kids away this evening over it. She also lied about me screaming at her, I have video evidence proving otherwise. She began this entire situation and can't be told anything she doesn't like. She's awful. She told me have a job, by the end of the week. I had this in a day. This job has nothing to do with the trouble I got in. That was in two entirely different cities, ACROSS a ferry system. This is a different place, I would go straight to work and back. Yet he wants to kick me out over it. I'm kinda prepared to let him no matter how hard things will be on me. I'm currently at my grandmas, thinking about what to do. I told him he was wrong and kick me out over it, but we are both talking to him tomorow.\n\nI'm trying my best. I don't understand. So reddit.. am I really wrong? AITA?",

I didn't say anything about this to her, thinking it wasn't my place to get involved. \n\nMaybe a week or 2 after that, her boyfriend found messages on her laptop (unintentionally) to several other guys that she's been texting and flirting with behind his back. This obviously upset the guy, so he came to my S/O and told him about all this. My partner came to me, and told me about this, because seeing as she's my friend, I should try and talk to her. I confronted her and she went to her boyfriend, and started giving him shit for going to my S/O and \"spreading gossip\".\n\nSomehow, me and my partner turned out to be the cause of they argument, which we weren't keen on being involved in in the first place. And we lost touch for most of the summer.\n\nWhen I came back to university in September, my friend and I briefly met up with another mutual friend of ours, we seemed to talk it out, and come to the conclusion that what happened during the summer wasn't anyone's fault and it was just a big misunderstanding where everyone ended up getting heated and overreacting. This was fine, we ended up talking and stuff again, seemed like everything was behind us.\n\nRecently we met up again, she had a few drinks and accidentally let it slip to us that she was planning to break up with her boyfriend after she finds her own place to move into, because she \"doesn't see it going anywhere\" .. \"he's just not (her ex's name)..\"I just need a place to stay at the moment and have nowhere else to go\". This surpised and shocked me, and I asked her is she sure she wants to break up because them two seem to work so well.\n\nAt the end of the night, I came home to my partner and tell him about this as it was kind of concerning me. He told me that he was thinking of just going to her boyfriend and telling him about this, as she is just using him and it isn't fair on the guy. I thought it was the right thing to do, so I ended up texting my friend and gave her a heads up. Basically saying \"hey look, I told my S/O about what you said, with all the breaking up and stuff, sorry, I know it wasn't my place, but it didn't seem fair\" she then came at me saying that she had never said that she was definitely going to break up with him (she did), etc. And that now she's gonna have to deal with that, thanks a lot.\nMy partner didn't even bother contacting the guy anyway though. \n\nI dismissed these as I knew she had a few drinks earlier that night, but she texted me the next day saying that I've always been a horrible friend, and that I only ever met up with her and our other friend to get the gossip, and then \"report back to your keeper\" which I found absurt and laughable to be honest.\n\nI have since stopped talking to her, blocked her on social media. I did see her a couple of days ago and we exchanged a few words, in which she informed me that she has in fact broken up with her boyfriend and that she has found a new place to live in, etc. I'm just not sure if I was an asshole in this, telling my boyfriend in confidence something that was bothering me.\n\nTL;DR: ex friend was using her boyfriend, his money, car, house, etc. She was planning to break up with him as soon as she had backup, and told me this. I told my S/O about this as he is friends with her boyfriend. He wanted to text him to warn him, I talked him out of it, but still told my friend that I had told him. She flipped out and started insulting me saying that I can't keep my mouth shut",

I will call her B. \n\nA little thing about B whenever she is with a guy, she changes. Her personality changes, she talks to me less and all. I can understand that to an extent but it is weird when we were actually like sisters. I think the serious issue started when I was hospitalized for one week, needed to take heavy medicine. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to come visit me. Whenever a friend worried about me and called me I just said \u2018I have nothing to worry\u2019 and \u2018please don\u2019t come\u2019. It wasn\u2019t as serious as a normal staying at hospital situation so I thought it wasn\u2019t worthy to make them worry. But B said, she heard about me and she will come visit me. I realized I really needed a friend with me. I was lonely, bored and in pain also I hadn\u2019t seen B for a long time, I had missed her. I was really happy she would come visit me but that day she didn\u2019t respond to my messages until end of the day. She just said she had a laser appointment and couldn\u2019t come. It felt pretty sad. (The worse thing is treatment lasts for 1 hour and her mother is the one working there, taking appointments so it was changable). I didn\u2019t talk to her after I came home. \n\nThen she messaged me after 2 weeks. She said \u2018she is sorry\u2019\u2019we are going to go out together always\u2019 \u2018she is going to buy me gifts and do whatever to make me feel better\u2019\n\nI was happy again so I accepted her apology.

So the event was 9am - 6pm and we could have gone anytime. When it was my birthday, she texted me at 6pm if I wanted to do something. I just said no and after one week only thing she wrote was about if I still have my cat\u2019s cage with me or not. \n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything to deserve this from the person I called best friend for a long time and I want to learn if I am asshole if I dont speak with her anymore.

We\u2019ve lived together for a bit over a year and when I first moved in we became best friends immediately. However with that closeness came disparity and we\u2019ve had a few arguments since then. I\u2019ve never had this kind of dynamic with any friend or housemate before, and the first time we fought was a shock to me. \n\nThis particular incident has some backstory that informs my feelings and reaction. A few months ago we had a fight after Mary accidentally got the impression that I showered twice a day every day. She told me that I shouldn't; I said that I didn't except in special cases, but \"also hygiene is a really personal thing and on really sweaty summer days I might shower twice, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unusual or a bad habit.\" She didn't take this well, citing how much water one shower uses and \"to be asked not to take 2 showers a day in a share house is a reasonable request. What\u2019s not reasonable is how self-righteous you are about it and how you\u2019re trying to infer that your hygiene is being policed. Please don\u2019t manipulate the conversation this way ever again, I don\u2019t take lightly to manipulation whether it\u2019s conscious or not.\" These were literally her words in the message she sent me.\n\nI was actually really hurt by her reply. I\u2019ve tried to take the criticism in stride and work on being less defensive and more clear in my communication. As a result of this conversation I have been extra careful to never shower twice a day unless I have a good reason.\n\nNOW: \nI work night shifts and on this night got home around 10.30pm. While at work I had started to feel itchy and even after leaving the office it didn\u2019t go away. While Mary and our other housemate John watched a movie, I laid in bed feeling itchy, depressed (for other reasons), and apathetic. After the movie John took a shower which gave me the idea to do so myself, as it might help my itchiness. \n\nMary often has to be up early (earlier than the rest of us) and has asked us not to make noise once she goes to bed on school nights (including not flushing the toilet or taking showers, as our pipes rattle hard). I respect this and do my best not to make noise on those nights. At this point however Mary was still pottering around in the kitchen. At 11.40 as I got into the shower I heard Q grumbling about us showering close to midnight. I was in and out of the shower within five minutes and went straight to be afterwards.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to these messages:\n\n&gt;HER: Hey showerinpeacepls quick question, why?\n&gt;You got home an hour ago and tomorrow is your day off: why now?\n\nThese messages made me really uncomfortable. I feel like a child being asked to explain myself to my mother, except that I\u2019m 30. I want to tell her what I\u2019m feeling but I'm not confident I can face her without being sure: am I the asshole?",

She agreed with this logic and I suggested until she minds that less maybe she should stay off my Facebook. I triple checked this was OK with her and she continued to agree.

At first and we started getting closer. Though they kept \"joking\" about how I don't love them, so I reassured. Over time it felt that they were joking less and less and just wanted me to prove my love for them. They had also gotten out of bad relationship. Eventually it lead to an argument where which I cried. after they said they didn't mean it. Over time they kept saying I didn't love them and would leave them. This was my first serious relationship so I kept reassuring them that I did and wanted to prove my affection because I did really love them. Of course it wasn't all bad as they wrote me handmade cards that were really sweet and gave me an old toy of theirs. They also talked about how they wanted to do as much as we could in life and I respected that and how they managed to get out of a horrible relationship before. While I was on holiday with my family they sent a big block of text saying how I really don't care about our relationship + that I never make time for them. After and talking to my parents I broke up with them, they texted me and attempted to call me after saying that I was abandoning them + that I was just proving their point. I wanted them to be happy + I thought it would be best if we had some space.\n\nPart 2: After time apart I saw then again at my college and thought that I was an asshole for what I had done as all my old feelings started to come back but tenfold. So after a lot of time and effort. Many nights of staying up till 3AM to apologise and wanting to treat them right. We got back together and it was better than any moment in part 1. I thought we would be happy together now. Eventually the jokes about how I don't love them came back and now using me breaking up with them in an unintentional or intentional guilt trip for me to do more for them. On valentines day I made them a paper rose, a poem I wrote, a drawing of their favourite animal and a handmade necklace. I have also stayed up countless times to help them with their fears and worries, their mother who is verbally abusive to them. I have learnt to accept myself, I want them to be happy too but I feel that nothing I do means anything after a day. I know that they are hurt and that's likely the reason for it but I don't like being treated like their X and as someone who doesn't care. Especially when they say I only care about myself and don't even try to see things how they do. Though I'm not with them again because I want to prove a point or I pity them.\n\nHowever at this point I'm starting to doubt if they even love me and if my feelings are fading too.",

            "input": " \n\nFirst post here, here's the story: my car needed a brake job. There's an auto body shop roughly 3/4 mile from my work site, which is convenient as it's semi-close, however it's not reasonable to walk between there and my work site due to time constraints of a busy workday. The auto shop offers a shuttle service in one direction- from the shop to my work site. So once my brake job was complete, I would require transport from my work site to the auto shop. Normally, I'd do Uber. But my partner happened to have an off-day from work on the day that I was planning to get the auto work done, and he lives close to both my work site and the auto shop (we've been together 2+ years but do not yet live together). So my thinking was- when my car is ready, he can pick me up at work and drop me off at the auto shop.  I notified him about 1 day in advance of this plan. He grunted some comment about not liking to have to do extra stuff on his day off, but he agreed.\n\nOn the repair day, around 1pm I get word from the auto body that my car is ready. I call my partner to tell him to come get me. When he answered the phone, it was clear that I'd woken him from sleep. So I feel bad, but I told him \"look, the place is open till 5pm. Just finish your nap and then come pick me up once you're actually awake\". But no, he wanted to come do the drop at that moment, to get it over with. So he picked me up and then dropped me off at my car no problem. When he dropped me off at the auto shop, he told me he was going home to go back to bed.\n\nThat evening he called me when he was awake. In conversation, he tells me it *really* messed up his day off to have to transport me to my car. He asserted that - as a floor nurse, he **needs** his days off for catching up on rest. I thought about it, and quickly stated that I didn't feel bad whatsoever; I've transported him to appointments in the past on my days off from work, and of course I would expect him to do the same for me. Then he gets more upset, claiming that I'm inconsiderate of his time off and his well-being. He even goes as far as telling me that I \"need to bring \\[him\\] dinner\" for the inconvenience that I caused him (I would have been fine to pick up some take-out for him in any case, but his sense of entitlement seemed undeserved and particularly annoyed me).\n\nI'm a bit floored by all this. In any serious relationship (we've been together 2+ years), I would expect any partner to accommodate such a simple request without making some big deal out of it. He often (not just in this instance) talks about how on his days off, he just really needs to rest and recharge, claiming that' it's a nurse thing' that I wouldn't be able to understand. If this latter part is true, then maybe I should feel badly for assigning him this task on his day off. I do have many concerns about how this behavior will affect our relationship when we live together, but before I even start thinking along those lines I first need to know - AITA?",

Eventually, he decided on going to Disneyland. The trip was planned for right after I graduated high school. My dad planned the destination and made all the arrangements.\n\nWe ended up stopping in Vegas to see my cousin, which is where things started going down hill for me. I wanted to see the Beetles Cirque do Soleil bad enough to offer to pay for my own ticket (for this one specific thing), explaining I had some money saved up. He took this as \"I got the rest of this trip for myself\". From then I was expected to pay for everything on my own including attractions, food, and chipping in for gas. \n\nThis kind of bothered me, but the worst ended up being Disneyland. I paid for the ridicously expensive ticket and we were there for maybe 4 hours (which was maybe 3 rides and a churro) and ended up leaving, though my dad said we'd go back the next day. I was super upset because this was the part of the trip I was looking forward to the most and it was so expensive and we left so quickly. The next day my dad and sister decided they wanted to go to SeaWorld (I hate fish) and my dad got very mad because I was upset about it and said I could go (and purchase my own ticket) or stay at the sketchy hotel by myself all day. \n\nWhat I had thought would be an amazing trip to bond with my dad became a pretty stressful time. I worried about all that money I hadnt planned on spending and felt pretty resentful.\n\nTo this day thinking about it still riles me up, but recently I started wonder if I was being an entitled teenager.

I have been giving her as much space as I possibly can. When she walks into a room and ignores me, I leave until she is gone. I feel like I've done everything I can to let her process what she needs to, but she doesn't seem to feel bad at all anymore.\n\nThis has had a huge impact on my life recently. She has made me feel like dirt by pushing me away. At this point, I'm not even sure I like her romantically anymore, but this is still hurting me because she's one of my best friends.\n\nI don't even know what she's mad about, and all of my friends are saying she feels bad about what she's been doing, but she's done nothing to change it or even apologize. I sent her a few texts apologizing for whatever I may have done wrong and asking what I could do to fix it, but she's ignored them.\n\nMy only solution I have left is to walk up to her and tell her what she is doing to me. How this isn't because of me liking her, but because she is my friend. But with all of the stuff she's going through, it may just make things worse.",

I attend the same university as my friend, but I study under a different School so I've never personally had any experience with this lecturer. I have however heard of her before due to an extremely similar experience another friend had last year in her class, which lead to my choice of advice.\n\nSo a friend of mine was given an assignment to discuss whether or not they believed Millennials were entitled. The feedback they received after the assignment was complete was: \"It was so ironic that your essay came across as so entitled that I showed your essay to my husband and we had a good laugh at it\".\n\nMy friend was mortified. It wasn't that they didn't do well on the assignment that upset them, it was that they got virtually no feedback other than what I quoted and the lecturer's husband doesn't even work in our university and had no right to be shown my friends work, never mind ridicule it.\n\nSo long story short, when my friend came to me asking for advice I told them to go back to the lecturer. I told them to say they wanted actual constructive feedback for their work, and for their work not to be shared with her husband. They did just that and it somehow blew up in their face. I'm not sure how *exactly* it went wrong as the friend is giving me the silent treatment, but I'm pretty sure both the lecturer and my friend have to attend a disciplinary meeting with the School heads.\n\nI feel awful about the advice I gave. At the time I thought it was the best choice of action since the lecturer was being unprofessional imo, but I really didn't want my friend to end up in trouble since their having a hard time in uni anyway. I'm pretty sure they're giving everyone the silent treatment not just me, but I'm worried I fucked up here since I'm pretty much directly involved. AITA?",

He\u2019ll be gone for 4 days. \n\nWhen he originally asked if I could drive him, I told him it depended on my work schedule. He decided on the dates for his flight last minute, and my work schedule was already set. \n\nAt a friend\u2019s house yesterday he was talking about his trip and me driving him. At this time, I told him that he\u2019s probably going to have to drive himself because I work that day. (I have to be at work at 6:30 AM.) He started acting really dramatic and disappointed at which point I told him I would pay for his parking if it was that big of a deal ($8/day x 4 days)\u2014something I can\u2019t really afford right now, but he can. That still wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He continued to act pouty and it made it a bit awkward for the people we were with. I agreed to drive him because I just wanted to get out of the situation and he was making me feel guilty. \n\nLater that night, he asked if I was sure I could drive him. I again told him that it was incredibly early and I\u2019d be losing an hour of sleep\u2014which is a lot, IMO when you already wake up at 5:30 AM. I didn\u2019t want t drive him, but I sensed that he was still bitter and this was going to be a \u201cthing\u201d for him. I told him \u201clet\u2019s see what I feel like in the morning\u201d, meaning that if I was too exhausted he would drive himself or take an Uber. He agreed to this. \n\nMind you he also knew that I hadn\u2019t slept well the past 2 days either due to work and a little get-together on NYE. \n\nI woke up with him this morning at 4:30. I asked if he could call an Uber or drive himself because I tossed and turned last night and slept a total of 3.5 hours. He immediately started getting upset saying it was too late (he had 20 minutes until he had to leave\u2014plenty of time to call an Uber). \n\nI gave up. He\u2019d surely argue with me the entire time until he left and I\u2019d be awake anyway, so I drove him. \n\nNow...to put my work schedule into perspective: I work 13 hour shifts. I\u2019m on my feet all day long with little time to sit and also do some manual labor as part of my job. I get one 30 minute break at work. I\u2019m a nurse, so I have to be clear-minded and able to think critically throughout the day. I am scheduled to work 3 days in a row like this...the first being the day he needed to be drive to the airport.\n\nI just got off the phone with him and he\u2019s insisting that part of being in a relationship means that you sacrifice and do things like this for each other and I\u2019m being unreasonable and selfish. \n\nI think *he* was being childish and selfish. I\u2019m still mad about how he seemed to have manipulated me into driving him. \n\nAm I an asshole?",

            "input": "So a friend of mine was chilling over in my dorm room with a lady friend of his, (we\u2019ll call them Jack and Jill) both of them were enjoying playing smash bros with a bit of laughing and flirting, I would\u2019ve just let them be but a local dude from around the dorm (let\u2019s call him Frank) decided to tag along with them (to neither of their consent). \n\nWell while I didn\u2019t personally know Frank word is that he\u2019s that kind of guy that tries to force interactions with you even if you don\u2019t want to and has done it enough apparently to gain a fairly annoying reputation although the guys who I\u2019ve heard it from are too nice to tell him, due to apparently feeling bad about how he\u2019s a orphan kid and some other stuff, yet they do what they can to avoid him when possible. Well Jack has also had his run ins with Frank but his negative accounts are mostly when Jack has been hanging out with Jill and Frank shows up to ruin the party. Apparently Frank has a tendency to lie when around Jill and does so in a way that makes it seem like he\u2019s trying to impress her but at the same time his lies are so bogus that Jill can see right through them. Well Jack and Jill again are both too nice to tell him off but instead just let him go at it and entertain all his lies with occasional nods and \u201coh really\u201ds. \n\nSo here we are in the dorm and Franks starting to do exactly that type of stuff and it\u2019s getting on my nerves because while they\u2019re not dating or anything it doesn\u2019t take much to see that both Jack and Jill must be talking and Frank is really just making it awkward for them to enjoy each other\u2019s company. Well I had made the mistake of also letting Frank play the game as well so now he\u2019s stuck here and only making things more awkward. This whole time I\u2019m just observing the situation but then he just gets even worse, he was initially standing up playing the game but then decides he needs to sit down, cool, but for some reason he decides he needs to sit in between both Jack and Jill despite plenty of other space available so he initially asks Jill to scoot over but when she puzzling asks why and is hesitant to do so Frank takes things into his own hands and while Jill is still in the seat and playing the game moves her chair over from near Jack to make room for his own. \n\nWell that was a big problem for me personally and again made the atmosphere even more awkward, but I just decide to keep my mouth shut. So later on in an attempt to get Frank out of here Jack decides to switch to a two player game, and of course Frank has played this game so the whole time he\u2019s constantly instructing and touching Jills controller (even though, surprise, she wasn\u2019t asking for any of it). Well seeing as to how she\u2019s constantly denying his attempts to \u201chelp\u201d her Frank wanders off into the corner of the room and gets on his phone, and while I don\u2019t know what he was doing while he was on there he decides to randomly say \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m single... My dick is so perfect\u201d\n..... \n\nSaying this loud enough for everyone to hear, but I guess he doesn\u2019t think we heard him because as me, Jack and Jill are all looking at each other, our eyes giving that \u201cdid he really say that\u201d look, he decides to say it again, \u201cI mean my dick is godly perfect\u201d, this time passing by Jill and giving her a slight look as he does so, I\u2019m guessing for assurance to see if she was at all aroused by this comment, which she of course isn\u2019t returning. Well Jack is the first to speak up and tells Frank that \u201cthat was uncalled for and he should really watch out what he says and who he says it around\u201d but as I said before Jack is just too nice and I didn\u2019t feel like he really got across just how uncomfortable Frank just made everybody so I then decide to check him as well. \n\nSo, and I quote, tell him, \u201cNah dude that shits not okay, you say some stupid shit like that again and you\u2019re getting the fuck out of my room\u201d.  Well I\u2019m guessing it works because for the rest of the night the guy isn\u2019t nearly as annoying but still lingers in the room, and the whole time I\u2019m regretting not having sent him out then and there.\n\nAITA for the way I responded to the whole thing given what went down that night, and taking into account the fact that he\u2019s a orphan and pretty socially awkward.",

Betty, who is much older, has asked this girl to not interact with Betty's friends when she is not present, made unbecoming comments of this girl's appearance, and believes that they are supposed to be really great friends while primarily taking up this girl's time for her own needs. Basically overall a shitty friendship relationship with poor ass communication on both parts. Their relationship now stands completely broken with Betty thinking she can fix it and the other girl not wanting to live with her, and considering moving out herself.\n\nMy other guy roommate has this genuine feeling of unease around her. He has stated \"I am not comfortable sometimes coming in the front door of my own house\". This is the nicest guy around and the person who brought Betty into the mix. He has expressed that this is not a good fit.\n\nWith both of my other roommates expressing it's not a good fit (put lightly), along with me for the most part not seeing eye to eye with this woman, I felt that it was important that I communicate to her that I didn't think this 6 month old housing situation was any longer a good fit. I asked her to consider finding new housing, but expressly stated she doesn't have to as that is her right, we are all on the lease. I offered to help her find a new place and do whatever I could do to smooth the transition. I figure it's good to get it in the open.\n\nShe said no. My other guy roommate has on his own asked the same of her at this point. Regardless of that, she has communicated she feels it isn't fair and that we have bullied her (probably have at this point just by all of us expressing our issue we have with her (separately)) and she wants to stay and fix this. She definitely feels like we are at fault here as well, that we are scapegoating, and that we can't just fix a problem by \"kicking someone off the island\". I just straight up disagree that this is just that. I genuinely think this isn't worth trying to work on when we are all just getting to know each other.\n\nWe all could have definitely communicated better about these issues we have with Betty and done so earlier on, but the fact of the matter is we didn't, and now we're here. So I operated with what I still have. Not defending myself, just explaining that us, the rest of the house, could have done a better job communicating our issues earlier. Thanks!",

I met my friend (24, male (let's call him Brian)) at school in 2010 and we've been hanging out together regularly ever since. I would pretty much consider myself as a very emotional, caring person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, everything was great until we got our A-Levels. We would still hang out a lot but it wasn't like the time we've been hanging out at school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into lots of arguments, as most of people in friendships do, which is very normal to me. I always approached him with what I didn't like and vice versa. The problem here is that I was always trying my best to not hurt him and avoid the things that would annoy him. He wouldn't do the same for me. He would try to provoke me every now and then even though he knew that certain things hurt me. I confronted him with this and he said that he's sorry and that he would stop it. He didn't. I learned to ignore it so it was fine after a while.  \n\n\nHe told me, that he really wanted to try weed at one point. I said that it's his decision but I advised him to thoroughly consider trying it in first place but also be careful where to get it from. So, one day he would invite 2 friends he met on the internet via online gaming to a sleepover LAN party. I got invited but I didn't really want to go at that point. So at the day, I was with another friend and he said 'How's Brian doing and I said that he was fine. He really wanted to see Brian so we called and asked if it was fine when we joined and he said he'd love us to come over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrive there and he's wasted af. The other 2 guys are listening to music VERY loudly while he is there lying on the couch looking really horrible. I'm concerned about him and ask what happened. He tells me that he tried weed and he feels miserable. After finding out that he hadn't eaten anything that day I decide to go to the kitchen and cook something for him as the other guys seemingly don't care. After that, I tell him to rest and the other guys to be quieter so that he can rest. We haven't talked about this day ever since, he didn't even say thanks for being there for me or anything like that.  \n\n\nOne day, I asked him about doing sports together. He is a good looking, athletic guy while I am overweight and have anxiety issues. I told him that it would boost my motivation if he went to the gym with me. He said that he didn't like gyms that much and didn't want to go. That was completely fine by me as I can't force anyone into anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, we would meet with 2 other guys (also met via online gaming) and have a nice time together. One of them proceeds to ask Brian if he wanted to join them doing sports at the gym and Brian immediately says yes. I'm obviously a little confused because our conversation about gyms was not that long ago. He looks me in the eye while agreeing and doesn't even ask me if I wanted to join as well. I'm really hurt but manage to forget it.  \n\n\nRecently, I asked him about something I wanted to buy and he told me that he knows someone who would get discounts and that he could ask them if I want.

I felt replaced.  \n\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I decided that I would act like him and not contact him anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole because I can't take this shit anymore and don't want to be hurt anymore?",

All names have been changed.\n\nWe get to church, we're all hanging out and laughing and having a good time, and B and Todd walk away to go talk, alone.\n\n(For context, B had told me earlier that she needed to talk to Todd about something personal, and I was like okay? you do you boo. Harpago was less supportive and wanted her to talk to him about it instead, but every time she'd brought it up to him previously, he'd gotten angry and impossible to reason with.)\n\nI did not see Todd and B walk away from our group. Seeing as both the guy I have a massive crush on and my very sick best friend have disappeared, I, understandably, panic.\n\nSaid panic gets worse when another guy we know, S, walks over and whispers something to Oliver, who immediately gets angry with him and tells him to stop trying to start rumors. I, already being wound up from Todd and B's disappearance, freak out even more and ask Oliver to tell me what S said to him.\n\nOliver explains angrily that S was trying to start a rumor that Todd and B were 'spooning' on the metal stairs outside and that they'd gotten caught and yelled at by a leader. I then start shaking and put my head in my hands, because B has had issues with one male leader in particular because she's dating Harpago, a known troublemaker. Now, I know that Todd and B would never do anything bad, but I do know that Todd is parked in the back lot by the metal stairs and that they might've gone to a Walmart up the street, which is something we do often.\n\nI try to call B. No answer.\n\nI send a text in my group chat with Todd and B. No answer.\n\nI call Todd. Rings once, goes to voicemail.\n\nI call B again. No answer.\n\nI'm now on the verge of a panic attack- this is my closest friend and she's in pain, both mental and physical, and now she's missing, and so is the guy I like (who I am also close friends with). Oliver, Calvin, and Lily are all telling me that I'm overreacting and that everything is fine, but I can't calm down.\n\nLater, Todd and B reappear, coming in through the doors that lead to the lobby area. I yeet over there and ask B if I can hug her (there's a story there), she says yes, I pull her into a bone-crushing hug and when I let go I give her a stern talking-to, choked up and with tears in my eyes. Todd explains that they've been in the lobby, and everybody goes back to hanging out as normal.\n\nLater that night, I get a series of four texts from Harpago. He's berating me, telling me that B doesn't have to report her every move to me and that I need to 'stop being an asshole to her all the time' and that I'm 'not him when I  am not there'. I'm thinking to myself, dude, that's really controlling, but because I was not doing well mentally, I just apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nAITA?",

            "input": "This is a crazy long post but I feel like you need the whole picture. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSeven years ago, I met a guy in my college dorm and we quickly became best friends. Toward the end of the year, we started fooling around. I wanted a relationship but he didn\u2019t. Fast forward about 6 months (and a summer apart), and we decide to get together. At the beginning, he didn\u2019t treat me very well, not because he was a genuine asshole, but just generally immature and I think he still didn\u2019t like me as much as I liked him. However, it is important to note (and you\u2019ll see why in a minute) that our sex life was definitely healthy at this point. \n\nThen, his behavior toward me started changing and I could tell he started to like me a lot more. He started doing things like waiting for me to get in my car before going back in his house and texting me nice things during the day. However, the nicer he gets, the less frequent sex becomes. By year 2-3, it gets to the point where we are having sex about once a year, not even exaggerating. By year 5, this has taken a massive toll on my self-esteem. During a summer abroad, I cheated on him. I\u2019m not trying to defend my actions here, there is no excuse for this. After I got back, I came clean and we tried to work it out. We sat down and wrote out all the things that needed work in our relationship. Things like he needed to pay me compliments, I needed to quit smoking, and most importantly, we needed to have sex much more often. We set to work putting our plan into action. \n\nA few days later, I realized I was super uncomfortable having sex with him. I had no physical attraction to him whatsoever. I think after a couple years of not feeling good enough, I stopped being attracted to him as a defense mechanism. We broke up. However, he was still my best friend, and at this point, we still had 8 months on a lease that neither of us wanted to pay to break. For a few months, things were awkward and sad, but after a little while, things got much better. \n\nFast forward to today. He has been an absolute sweetheart to me these last few months, however, I am still not sexually attracted to him at all. We are best friends, go out to eat all the time, talk on the phone almost every day, etc. He has bought me flowers once before when I had a really bad day, but yesterday, he sent me a beautiful bouquet for Valentine\u2019s Day. This is where I started evaluating behavior over the last few months. Occasionally, he has used sweet nicknames with me or called us going out to eat a \u201cdate\u201d (but like sarcastically? Like he definitely knows it\u2019s not a date), but I always would say \u201cno\u2026\u201d and kind of laugh it off. But now that he sent me flowers\u2026I don\u2019t know, I just feel so guilty, like I\u2019ve been leading him on all this time? He knows I\u2019ve gone on a few dates with other people so it\u2019s not like he thinks I\u2019m just waiting to get back with him.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting here that he has extreme social anxiety and never goes out or meets new people. His group of friends is the exact same people we met freshman year of college, which would be completely fine, except they are almost all gone. The last two left in town have plans to move in the next few months. I have no desire to cut contact with him not just for my own selfish reasons, but also because he doesn\u2019t have a single other friend left in town. I\u2019ve tried to suggest ways for him to meet new people but every time I bring it up, he gets irritated and defensive. If I cut contact with him, I'm afraid he would spiral into a deep depression.\n\nOkay, holy shit, I\u2019m so sorry for that massive wall of text, but if you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you so much! So Reddit, am I an asshole?\n\nTLDR: Ex and I dated for five and half years. Broke up due to no sexual connection/attraction but have stayed best friends for a year and half. He has occasionally said or done \u201cromantic\u201d things that I tried to shut down but I have not cut contact or anything. I want to stay friends both because I love him (as a friend) and because he doesn\u2019t have any other friends. Does this make me an asshole?",

Just like some feedback for myself. \n\nI'm a single mother with 2 kids (12F, 15M) and the older one has had some issues with video gaming and internet use which heavily affected his grades. So now I have a system where the internet is always disabled right when they get home. They leave their smartphones downstairs and they have 2 hours after school each day to finish their homework. Once they're done, I reactive the internet and they can do as they wish. \n\nI thought I was being responsible with this. Before, I'd frequently find them both surfing instagram or social media while they claimed to be working on homework. Now I know they're working because they show me the work and I can at least be satisfied that some things are being completed. My younger daughter is ok with this system although my son has argued that I'm too controlling and even \"abusive\" for limiting his internet access. He says internet is basically a right and I can't restrict and isolate him just because I don't understand. But the thing is before I implemented this system he was making constant Cs in school. He played online games all night or would just chat with his friends. Now he's actually completing schoolwork. \n\nAITA for enforcing this rule? I was surprised when I saw similar situations pop up online and people saying the mother was abusive for limiting internet. Is this really the case?",

He\u2019ll be here for 5 days (Friday morning through Tuesday evening), most of which we plan to spend together catching up and hanging out. He\u2019s expressed that I\u2019m the main reason he\u2019s coming to visit, and that he\u2019d like to spend as much time with me as possible while here. A few of the days he\u2019s visiting I\u2019ll have to work, and I set aside about 2 hours every day for a work out. He\u2019s aware of both of these limitations and has told me he\u2019s ok with them.

We\u2019ve been dating for about 3 months and it\u2019s going pretty well. Lately, though, we haven\u2019t had much of a chance to see one another due to work, sickness, and the holidays.

However, due to my friend\u2019s visit we won\u2019t be able to see each other for another 2 weeks in between our upcoming date and the next date. I\u2019d like to avoid this, because I really want to get to know this guy I\u2019m seeing better and another 2 week break isn\u2019t exactly great for a budding relationship, but I also don\u2019t want to be an asshole to my friend who is traveling a long way to visit me.

I work full time (since i dropped out of college) so I stopped playing xbox and soccer and that was WAY before my daughter was born and during the time Nat was pregnant.

Throughout the day, when I feel that I'm finished with my daily chores and when Amy is sleeping and once Nat is relaxing I'll try to workout because my inactivity has made me gain weight and now I'm not even the shadow of the fit player I used to be.

But that\u2019s the least of my worries.\n\nShe has a second job, the job she worked before the job she has now. She only covers people\u2019s shifts sometimes, and because of this she takes shifts on days she has off. She works too much. Not because I won\u2019t be able to see her, but because she has no time to eat. She wasn\u2019t like this before working her new job. She keeps picking at her fingers, to the point where it hurts her. She\u2019s constantly stressed out, and has little to no time to do her homework at home so she does it in school. Her parents have told her that they\u2019re not forcing her to work, and she can quit if she wants to. I feel bad because I encouraged her to apply to her new job, and now I realize that it might not be the best for her to work there anymore. \n\nWe were texting last night, and she was super anxious because she felt like she ate too many gummy bears. Because recently, she\u2019s been eating almost nothing all day. The past month or so, she just hasn\u2019t been herself. She was scheduled for every day this week minus Thursday, but she took off Friday and Saturday to be with her best friend on their birthday. Thursday, she took a shift at her other job. I do honestly think she works way too much, and it\u2019s not healthy for her.\n\nHere\u2019s where the AITA part kicks in. I don\u2019t want her to quit, even if it may be better for her. If I told her how I feel about this, I know she\u2019ll overthink it and think too much into it. She\u2019ll probably think that I do want her to quit, and she\u2019ll think she\u2019s a bad girlfriend because she\u2019s always at work and never has time for me (which isn\u2019t true on the weekends, but I have work Sunday so we can only go out Saturday and whenever she doesn\u2019t have work.) She\u2019s not a bad girlfriend at all, and I don\u2019t want her to think that. She has before, for similar reasons, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she has to think into things like this so much. I don\u2019t know if I can tell her. The earliest I can see her is probably Tuesday, since I have work Sunday and Monday and she\u2019s going to be at her friends\u2019 for her birthday. Help me out please, because I honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t want her to feel down like this. I don\u2019t want her stressing out so much because she doesn\u2019t eat because of work. But I don\u2019t want her to overthink everything, and maybe feel worse if I did tell her.",

About a year or so ago we used to play a lot of TF2 and Minecraft together via Discord, but at some point the other things in life got in my way, and I just felt too tired to talk to him in general most of the time. He has much more energy than I do, it seems, and so is much more eager to play together when I'd rather just play Rocket League or Minecraft in single player and relax with some hot cocoa. \n\nHe spammed me a lot at some point, sometimes even called me on my phone, so I ended up setting my Discord status to \"invisible\" so he wouldn't see that I was online. \n\nThis friday he called me again on my way back from the choir, and I thought \"well it won't take a piece out of me to play with him once in three months\" so... we played some TF2 and Minecraft together. I have to say, it was pretty fun for a bit before I started getting a headache. I told him I'd download War Thunder on my desktop and then we can play it sometime. However, I forgot to download the game and just did not feel like talking to him in general.\n\nToday he started spamming me again while I was playing some singleplayer Rocket League, and when I told him that I was too tired right now and that I have a hard school day tomorrow(Actually true) he pretty much went \"who cares\". \n\nI really don't have anything against him, but he is kind of not nice sometimes, I'm trans and he knows it, yet he keeps calling me by the name I don't want to be called by, he is really annoying at times, and I get this is all part of being a 12 year old, but I'd just prefer to play with someone older and a bit more mature.

Most were known to me for at least few weeks before we've done it, for obvious reasons. Didn't want any regret to turn into ruining of my life. But recently few of my friends have accused me of taking advantage of those girls and raping them when the subject was brought into the conversation. I feel like i should mention I'm a guy.\n\nIt was often that both of us were drunk, but there were occasions where I was 100% sober and they weren't and vice versa. As sex while drunk goes, sometimes it was too long with lots of painful jaws, uncomfortable, slow, messy and so on. But newer non consensual. None of them were to the point of passing out, not knowing whats happening or unable to communicate. If they were, nothing would happen. Some were pretty persistent and sometimes forceful, but it was easy to hold them till they would eventually tire themselves out. So nothing would really happen. \n\nOf course they got more relaxed while being drunk and wouldn't probably have it while sober or try the things they did in the bedroom. There is no denying that, alcohol does that. Want to mention i never pressured or encouraged them to drink more so that i could get laid. See no point in that. \n\nAs mentioned I've been labeled as rapist by those people and that is really disturbing to hear.

This is special because a) I also work M-F and he works weekends, so it's rare we have a day off together; and b) our 7-month-old was sick recently and he was the one who stayed home with her for, so he hasn't had a day off in a month as he has been catching up since that time.\n\nSince it's a holiday and also my birthday tomorrow (but he'll have to work tomorrow), I wanted us to go out to lunch as a family. To exemplify how rare this happens, the last time we were able to all three go out together was in October. Yes, as in 2018. And *that* was our first family outing... so suffice it to say family time doesn't happen often and I want to take advantage of today.\n\nHe is refusing to go because he said he's tired from work, and has a toothache. Okay, so this is a legit toothache, but here's the thing. He has had problems with the tooth for a year. He does nothing about it (actually, he has to get it extracted and a whole bunch of dental work that we can't afford has to go along with that, so we're just waiting for the magical day we can save the money for that surgery until he can get the tooth out). \n\nSo while I understand that having a chronic toothache sucks, as does working all the time, I also think it's important to spend family time together. It's not like I'm asking him to take us on a huge excursion or anything. It's lunch. At a cheap caf\u00e9. Like, soups and coffee sort of deal. And he can't be bothered/tooth hurts too much.\n\nThis is the only thing I've asked for for my birthday, because we can't afford presents now that we have the baby and all. If we don't go today, who knows when the next time he'll have off will be. Could be months down the road before a day off for each of us coincides again on the same day and we can do something with our daughter.\n\nI should add that he is an *excellent* father - at home. He does more than his fair share of babycare, housework cleaning, etc... But it all stops at the door I take her to daycare and pick her up by myself M-F (b/c it's on the same side of town as my workplace), I take her to playdates, I take her to baby classes and the park and basically all of her socialization outside the house is just her and me alone, whether or not I'm tired from working all week, whether or not I'm sick or have a headache or something. It's like at home we're this great family unit but outside the house I'm a single mom.\n\nSo who's the asshole here? Am I being unreasonable for insisting he go to lunch as a bday present to me (and to spend time with his wife and kid) even though he's understandably tired, and has a legit toothache? Or is he making a mountain out of this toothy molehill?",

After dinner, the guys migrated to watch the football game, and the women disappeared again. I thought they just didn't like football. It turns out that the women spend 2 hours before the meal cooking, folding napkins, setting tables, etc. Then after the meal, the women spend another hour or two doing dishes and cleaning. By the time they were done cleaning, everyone was preparing to leave.\n\nThe next holiday, aunt-in-law mentioned that the women would like to meet me, since we barely interacted. They'd love if I could come an hour early and help set up. I shook off the vague Stepford Wives vibes and I figured, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n\nSo my then-boyfriend and I showed up early. The women looked at me like I had grown a third eye. Aunt declared \"No men in the kitchen!\", he was banished to the TV room, and suddenly I was stranded with 20 people I didn't know. Most of these women are housewives, and it is a matter of pride that they do 100% of the housework and cooking. It quickly became clear that I am inept at floral arrangement and my knife work is not up to par (I know how to cook, but I really don't care if the carrots slices are uneven). One of the women told me not to worry because they will teach me to be \"bride ready\" so I can make my husband proud. Awkward.\n\nAfter the meal, the women started collecting dishes, and I mentioned to my then-boyfriend that we should both help out. But, he was again banished. So I retreated with him to the TV room and hung out with the guys. We played a board game while the women cleaned.\n\nThat was a few years ago, and since then, I stay with the guys during family holidays. I'm the only woman who does. Occasionally one of the women will hand me a stack of dirty plates, or ask for help with prep. I'll help out, but I usually pull my husband in to help, too. When he gets banished, I'll go too.\n\nWe go to family gatherings 3-4 times a year. 10 hours/year of housework will not kill me. Still, it feels really weird and archaic that the men lounge around while the women work. Also, the women kind of freak me out. They are 100% perfect housewives and can be pretty intense. Never a hair out of place. I'm a nerdy tomboy, and I'm way more comfortable with the guys.\n\nMy mom says I'm being rude.

She was first turned onto this by the \u201cMommy Group\u201d at her church.\n\nHer church/religious background: my friend was raised in a cult and unfortunately bears the scars of someone introduced to ultra-extreme conservativism at a young age. Even though she fled the cult, she gravitated to a man who made her join his religion to be with him (publicly, I might add as they\u2019d been sleeping together for a while). She gave up dreams to be a doctor for this guy and dropped out of college and used her college savings on a wedding.\n\nAlthough I was sad about this, and even a down right bitch at times, I\u2019ve learned that friendship is about staying supportive through the hurdles. We\u2019ve had gaps in our friendship before from fights that devastated us and it would be too difficult to do this again.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nThe church has \u201cElders\u201d who manage the church. Enter 7 nondescript aging white guys. The \u201cElders\u201d (not kidding, that\u2019s their name), have women and male groups split up and it\u2019s clear that while the men talk business and the future of the church, the women have been overcome by anti-vaccine propaganda. It\u2019s very clear that the \u201cElders\u201d are not involved nor concerned about the stuff in the women\u2019s group, and I really don\u2019t think they know the levels of insanity this group is at right now. \n\nI\u2019m so so tempted to write to the pastor, as my friend (who is very young and impressionable) really doesn\u2019t do anything her pastor won\u2019t tell her to do. She would be personally offended if I said anything to her about her kids. As much as I\u2019m disappointed in my friend, I\u2019m mostly pissed off at the mommy group for brainwashing the young moms. My friend went through post pardum depression and I feel like they knew how to exactly sink their claws into her when she was so vulnerable. \n\nHer kids are truly wonderful and I get upset every time I see a kid with measles because it\u2019s so preventable. A ton of moms now don\u2019t vaccinate and they work together on getting paperwork finalized for religious exemption or they pull their kids from school to home school them. \n\nI worry for her and her beautiful family, but I really want to give a fucking wake up call to the pastor who does not have any idea this is being taught in his church.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m obsessing or being controlling, and I can handle the honest truth as this has been on my mind for some time. I unfortunately grew up ultra religious and I know the pain that comes from that may make me more upset than the average person. \n\nTL;DR: friend\u2019s church has a mommy group that is teaching anti-vaccine propaganda to young, new moms without the churches knowledge. I would like to write an anonymous letter to their pastor to tell him about the uprising of anti-vaxx propaganda from their women\u2019s group.\n\nHoping for clarity ",

I have been with my wife for 3 years now I love my wife, she is with out a doubt \"the one\". \n\nShe has a group of friends that she grew up with and went to middle and high school with and she still has remained good friends with a lot of them. I think they are a wonderful group of people and generally everytime we get together it's a great time. They are a very welcoming and hospitable group and I had no problem falling in on friendly terms with a lot of them. The majority are over/out for dinner monthly.\n\nI have slowly started to notice that almost everytime we get together a subject (almost always jokingly brought up) is another one of our friends ( let's call him Jeff ) who has a, as some have referred to it \" the biggest dick they have ever seen\" \"not big, like freakishly huge\" \"you have your regular virginity, then your Jeff virginity\" type of endowment. \n\nThat being said it just seems like everyone in this group has some kinda fetish-worship about this guy and his hog, like I mentioned before, the jokes and stories they all share about different times they themselves have had sex with Jeff, or times they walked in on Jeff having sex with someone. I pointed this out to my wife after dinner Saturday about the cult like worship and her response was. \" I mean it is freakishly huge *laughs*\"\n\nMy problem with a lot of this is more complex than the way that everyone seems to obsessively talk about this guys hog. Some of it stems from the fact that my wife had a \"FWB\" relationship with him for a few years. ( 10 years ago, long before I ever met her) A lot of it I feel comes from the fact that everyone is comfortable OPENLY discussing this man's sex life.\nMaybe this is where I start to sound prude or like a baby but I don't openly discuss the kinds of kink my wife and I are into. I feel like everyone just being so nonchalant about discussing the first time they saw Jeff naked or the first time they saw Jeff fucking some random chick at a party is just.... too much\n\nThe whole thing just feels weird to me, with all of the different factors adding up, sometimes it just makes me reluctant to even agree to go out to dinner because at the end of the night regardless of where we go or what we do at some point this subject is going to be brought up and yet again I'm going to be forced to either confront the idea that my wife had sex with this guy for years or ignore it.\n\nI have tried to talk to my wife about it but at the end of the day, if the tables got turned I don't see any of it happening much less being so accepted. I would be mortified and embarrassed to sit across the table from an ex girlfriend as everyone else traded stories about having/seeing her having sex.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAITA for slowly over time wanting to exclude myself from group plans with my wife and her circle because of the constant inappropriate joking subject matter about her ex-bf/fwb's massive endowment",

We 'officially' cohabitated about 6mo into our relationship when her lease came up. At that time, we made the choice to buy a new queen bed since my full size was too small and her bed was 15 years old and had some extra lumps. Fast forward 8 years, and we bought our first house... and immediately splurged for a nice king size bed which we have greatly enjoyed this last year. \n\nIn those intervening 8 years, we lived with my parents in an attached apartment to their farmhouse. It had a separate entrance, 4 rooms, and the only shared space was the kitchen (though we even had our own fridge). I'm an only child, and my family had some serious events go on when I was in my teens / early 20s before i met my now wife.  The apartment space was something my dad and i had renovated together (and by renovated i mean ripped down to bare studs and completely rebuilt) but it was still at my parents and that was a point of contention with my now in-laws.\n\nOne of the reasons we had chosen to move in together back into this space involved then girlfriend deciding to go to grad school. While I have a decent paying job, it wasn't, and isn't, enough to support 2 adults and meet all the financial needs of student loan payments, cars, etc on top of rent. My parents let us stay rent free, just happy to have us close by and helping out in other ways. \n\nFast forward, and my wife is out of school, we've saved up and paid for our own wedding, then save up to buy a house. My parents are super supportive of the house buying, but sad to see us go. Dad helps renovate the new house, refinishing floors, painting, doing custom woodwork etc.  We move in a bit peicemeal over a  few months, but are close enough (20min) that ee don't have to rent a moving truck etc.\n\nNow, I'm not debating that I'm an asshole for this next part... I totally own that i fucked up here. Due to work and some personal commitments, i drop the ball after we've gotten about half of our stuff out of the old apartment. My parents make comments once and a while, but NBD. Then time goes on and it's suddenly been a year since we lived there and our shit still sits in that space. For some reason, getting my wife to go help pack the rest up is impossible. I've been chipping away at the small stuff, but the bed is still there. One of the major reasons is that whilenour new master bedroom is huge, it stole that space from the second (guest) bedroom. We've measured, and while technically the queen bed would fit, it would touch 3 walls and be a bitch to put sheets on.\n\nNow we get to the meat of it. About a month ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. He's started chemo and will likely be looking at a pretty significant surgery down the line if the chemo/radiation goes well.  My parents approached me about the apartment and specifically bed, as the space is better insulated (remember, major renovation) and had first floor connection to their kitchen. They ask if we would be willing to move the queen bed downstairs into the old living room so that dad isn't doing stairs etc.  I say I have to talk to my wife, but don't expect it to be an issue because it doesnt fit the space and we havent gotten it in the last year.\n\nNope. Big deal. Wife says have to have it as a guest bed. I've tried to get her to go with me to get it out the last two weekends, she has cone up with excuses not to. My parents want an answer.\n\nAs a point, as far as i know there are no weord feelings between my parents and wife.

He\u2019s slightly more \u201ctraditional\u201d in some ways; he likes to open doors for me, wants me to walk in front of him, etc. (this is relevant). \n\nWe live in a huge city, and it\u2019s extremely common for people to cross the street when the WALK sign is not lit if there are no cars coming, or even if there are cars but they are a block or more away.  I noticed recently that when we\u2019re out together, whenever I try to cross the street like this-- even when other people are also crossing-- his reflex is to snatch my arm and pull me back, as if I were about to run in front of a car. At first, I found it kind of endearing, like \u201caw, he\u2019s worried about my safety\u201d, and chalked it up to his other \u201ctraditional\u201d behaviors, but now I\u2019ve started to dislike it; it startles me, is unnecessary and feels a little insulting, like he doesn\u2019t trust me to handle myself.  I hadn\u2019t said anything until last night because I still felt that his intentions were good.\n\nCut to last night. We were heading back home after drinking with friends. I was definitely drunk but not blacked out or sloppy; I wasn\u2019t falling over or confused. I started to cross a street that had very slow traffic, but I was not near a car and there were lots of other people crossing. He grabbed me and pulled me back as he usually does, and at that moment, it pissed me off. I didn\u2019t say anything, but I yanked my arm back and continued crossing without him. \n\nOnce we were alone, we got into an argument about it; me giving him attitude by pulling away really hurt him. He said that he was just trying to look out for my safety, it wasn\u2019t just because I was girl and he would have done that with any of his friends, and he thought I was going to run in front of a car because I was drunk. He was mad enough that he said didn\u2019t want to see me for a couple days. \n\nI apologized and thanked him for looking out for me, and explained how it made me feel. He apologized too, but he\u2019s still unhappy with me.  Reddit what should I do? AITA? ",

Some we agreed were bad, some I liked. Emma liked none of them, and she has twice now gone against an applicant just because they were a freshman.

It being a higher level class that doesn't always take attendance, many people decide not to show up to class, so there are often empty seats around me. However, I always sit next to my friend and there is always someone sitting in front of me.\n\nAn assignment for the class is to write an Op-Ed, basically a short opinionated article. As part of the assignment, everyone in the class was randomly assigned two others to peer review their article.\n\nOf the two I was assigned, one was pretty good. They had a few grammatical errors and their points were a little confusing at times, but overall decent. I also didn't know too much about their topic to begin with.\n\nThe second one I reviewed was a train wreck at best. There were so many grammatical errors that I couldn't even read through the paper once without having to make corrections. Their sentence structure was so bad that I had to stop and try to parce out what it was supposed to say. I also knew a lot about this topic since I had written a paper on it a semester ago. They had the basic idea about the topic, but they left out a huge part of it that was really important to their point they were making.  All of that I left in my review that had my name attached to it online, but I didn't know who the person really was.\n\nAs class was ending the other day, my friend and I's conversation drifted to the Op-Eds that we had reviewed as people were packing up to leave. It turns out that he had looked at the first one I reviewed for fun and he had liked it as well. The other one he reviewed had some issues, but was ok overall. I told him about the topic that my second reviewed Op-Ed was about and what the person had left out. I reffered to the grammatical errors and bad sentence structure as a \"hot mess\" as I complained.\n\nI started to hear someone near me saying \"hey\" to get my attention and I looked up at the person who sat right in front of me. They informed me that I was talking about their paper and then walked away. My friend and I got real quiet and he gave me a 'you really screwed up now' face. I said that I stand by what I said, since basically all the things I mentioned were in my review online that had my name attached to it anyway.\n\nNow I'm not sure if I should feel bad about trash talking someone's paper and them calling me out for it.",

We've gone on countless adventures together - sailing, backpacking, camping, ATVing, lan parties (showing our age!), motorcycle trips, canoe camping, etc. \n\nThe problem is, he's never really gotten his shit together.  He hasn't held a job for longer than a year, and has lived no less than 20 places in his life.  After his girlfriend of 9 years cheated on him, got pregnant during the fling, guilted him into being the father while debating an abortion, then had a miscarriage... he decided to finally seek professional help, and end that relationship.  He's been diagnosed with depression/ADD/alcoholism/anxiety and is taking prescribed medication to work through those issues.\n\nTo make matters worse, for the past few years he's been living with his narcissistic mom. But it's okay because she's a  changed woman, and now dishes out cutting remarks with a smile and a soft voice.  Donny thinks she can be annoying, but not \"all that bad.\"\n\nI strongly disagreed, and after working though my own issues with narcissists, I wanted to help him get out of that environment and start a life of his own.  He had been making such good progress seeking help and going on medication I thought she was the last thing holding him back.  \n\nHe's never actually lived on his own.  He's always lived/been supported by other people, including his mom and me in the past.  After I lived alone in a private seasonal campground for a month to get my own head on straight about some issues I was dealing with, I thought how great of an opportunity it would be for him to live there full time.  He could buy a camper for 5-7k, and pay $1500 in rent each year for the plot.  Cost of living would be extremely low ($125 rent/month - plus food, electricity and propane).  It's filled with friendly blue-collar workers who leave their campers there year round and treat it like a vacation cabin.  They are all having a blast, drinking, socializing, telling tall tails, driving around in golf carts, etc.  It's just a fun place to be, and an upgrade from his only other realistic option - a trailer park.  The mood at a trailer park is different I'd think... most people live there out of necessity not desire, and that probably wouldn't help him with his mental health.\n\nHe thought the camper/campground was a great idea so I helped him pick out an old 26 foot camper, inspect it (surprisingly good shape), talk the seller down ($1200 to $800) and borrow a friends truck to tow it home.  He paid for it of course.  I told him he could live in it at my house as long as he paid his own electricity and didn't barge in to our house without first calling/texting.  The plan was for him to live in it, fix it up, then sell it and upgrade to a better 5-7k camper and ultimately move into a seasonal campground.  (They have restrictions on age/condition of the campers they let in.)  We set an August 1st 2019 move out deadline (about a year).\n\nDuring this time my wife and I were planning our honeymoon - sailing around the Virgin Islands.  Then Hurricane Irma hit, destroying everything on the islands.  We decided on Costa Rica for our honeymoon instead.  The charter company in the Virgin Islands could only give credit rather than a refund, so we planned to go the following year.  (Quick note, we are not rich and these two trips were very expensive for us.  We had only budgeted for one.)  I suggested that we turn it into a trip with friends since plane tickets were only $400 round trip.  Since we had already paid for the boat, it wouldn't cost any more to bring a few people along.  So we invited Donny and my wife's friend \"Sarah\".  Both single, but they didn't hit it off.  They only had to buy plane tickets, and pay their own expenses like food, taxis and souvenirs - we would cover the \\~4k boat rental.\n\nThey were invited in April, and we planned to fly there in December - 8 months later.  I kept everyone updated by email with itineraries and estimated personal costs as I planned out the trip.\n\nAt some point during all of this, Donny has moved into his camper at my house, begins reverting to old ways, stops showing up for his full time job, and gets fired.  He picks up a part time job where he has the option to work 40 hours a week, but can work as much or as little as he wants.  He of course picks the latter.  I'm beginning to suspect that he won't have enough money for the trip so I ask him about it.  He assures me he will have enough and all is good.  He already bought the plane tickets.\n\nSo we fly out of cold ass Wisconsin and into the tropics.  Everyone is in high spirits, I mean, how can you not be?  We get to our rental sailboat, a 2017 Jeanneau 349, and it's a fucking dream boat.  We set sail and go from island to island, sleeping in the boat.  It's amazing.  Dolphins, white sandy beaches, perfect weather, beach-side restaurants, 85 degree water, snorkeling, you name it.  Then it happens.  **The ambush.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDonny - waiting until my wife and Sarah are off the boat - \"I'm out of money, I didn't realize how expensive everything was going to be... is there any chance you can spot me until we get back?  I'll pay you back, I promise\".\n\nNow I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I say no, he can't get home.  If I say yes, I may not be able to pay my own bills when we return, and might never get paid back.  Nothing good can come from this conversation.  \n\nI gave in however, and asked him how much he needed.  After some hemming and hawing, he said $100 should cover everything.  Ok.  Borrowed him $100 - in cash.\n\nNot two days later he's out of money again.  I'm pissed.  I tell him tough luck and the three of us go enjoy the day while he sleeps on the boat.  Paradise gets me back into a good mood though, and I start to feel bad.  *Yeah... I know.*  If he can't pay the ferry ride back, or the taxis, he's stranded in the Virgin Islands.  *This alone would make for a good AITA post if I just left him there*... but I begrudgingly decide borrow him money for the rest of the trip.  On the bright side, Sarah is having no problem paying her own way throughout the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we get back home I don't really talk to him much.  The trip, amazing as it was, has an underlying shitty feel to it all.  I feel taken advantage of and it bothers me that he, my best friend of so many years, was so selfish and entitled during the trip of a lifetime.  Captain obvious senses something is wrong and texts me that he will pay me back this weekend.  Weeks go by and nothing.  I confront him.  Turns out, he wasn't even keeping track of what he owed me!  Thank fuck I was - $373 just for the trip!!\n\nI pull up his electric bills for the camper.  I charge him $0.13/kWh, send him monthly emails \"bills\" with pictures of the Kill-A-Watt meter, and allow 30 days to pay.  He's 90+ days late and hasn't paid anything. $115 behind.  Reminders answered with silence.  **It's the final straw, I'm fed up and go into asshole mode.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI forward the electric bill emails, and tell him he has 5 business days (Tuesday) to pay all late bills in full, or I'll disconnect his electric service.  I also add a $20 late fee to all future bills that become late.  Weather forecast is for 20F at night.  No electricity = no heat and frozen/broken water lines.  I hear nothing back.\n\nI have a face to face with him and express my general frustration about the trip, owed money and overdue electric bills.  He does his best to act sorry and promises to make things right.  I don't mention that I'm going to disconnect the power, but it was in the emails sent days earlier.\n\nA few days later I invite him over for dinner, mostly to get the pictures he took on his phone during the trip.  He said he'd upload them, but was clearly dragging his feet with misc half-truths.  I **never** bring up that I'm killing the electric on Tuesday unless he pays just the late electric bills.  Unprompted, he says something like \"I'll pay you for the electric bills on Tuesday or Wednesday.\" \n\nHe knows he won't get paid until Wednesday.  I know he won't get paid until Wednesday, but he doesn't know that.  I still plan to pull the power Tuesday if he hasn't paid, but instead of saying that, I just say \"Ok.\"\n\nIronically, the Kill-A-Watt meter fails a few hours later, killing his power.  15A heater + fridge + computer overloaded it.  He offers to pay for a new one (about $15) and I plug him back in unmetered.\n\nTuesday rolls along, and at 5pm I text him telling him I'm disconnecting the power in an hour unless all overdue electric bills are paid in full.  The following conversation ensues over text:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Donny:** \"You couldn't have told me this yesterday?  I told you I'm gonna pay it tomorrow\" \\[Wednesday\\].\n\n**Me:** \"It was in both emails.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"That's great.  Yesterday I told you I'm paying them all off, you didn't say anything\"\n\n**Me:** \"You say a lot of things.\"\n\n**Donny:** \"What's that supposed to mean exactly?\"\n\n *- 10 minute pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"Fine, I'll say it, my word means nothing to you.  I understand, rocky history, what do you want from me then?  An email?\"\n\n *- 5 minutes pass -* \n\n**Donny:** \"I don't think I've made an email since high school lol\"\n\n *- 30 minutes pass -* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI disconnect his power at the breaker.  He drove off 5 minutes after that without saying a word, probably to go back to his mom's house for the night, or cry to our mutual friend about how he's been wronged.\n\n24 hours later he said he'd be over at 7:30pm to pay his bill.  He showed up at 9:30pm acting like everything was all good and paid $200 - stating the extra money can go towards what he owes on the trip.  I tell him since the Kill-A-Watt meter failed, in a few days I'",

She was fun and I knew from that time she already struggled with anxiety to the point of not being able to do some tests out of nervousness, but it was getting worse each year.\n\nWhen school ended we both went to college we kept hanging out. We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\n\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoyed. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\n\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew her she wasn't well, but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \"I don't want to be your friend anymore\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\n\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\n\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\n\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness. I didn't lose lose any other friend because of this, but I'm sure they lost any admiration they ever had for me.\n\nAt the time I felt I really needed to do it but now I can't justify this behavior anymore.",

Will probably never log in after the dust settles from this (if there is any). \n\nI understand this is a convoluted question and it's a convoluted situation. I also hang around this sub enough to know this may get SHP or even troll accusations but I swear on everything this is real. I can give screenshots of the last product my ex wife purchased or whatever if no one believes me. \n\nSo I'm recently divorced. Ugly, ugly divorce where ex and I can't even stand to be in the same room together. We paid a fucking small fortune in lawyers fees because she wanted to argue about bullshit like who got patio furniture and the bird feeder that I didn't want anyways. In the end I just threw up my hands and said fuck it, she could keep everything, I just wanted out as long as I never had to see her again. Well we fought about that too because after saying she wanted the house, she didn't want the house and I had to dip into my 401k and IRAs to buy her out. Not that I even wanted the house, I just wanted her the fuck gone.  My ex-wife had pretty severe acne and the only thing that ever worked for her was this company called Paula's Choice. it worked so well that she would essentially buy thousands of dollars worth of the product at once in fear they would change the formula or cancel a particular creamer or whatever. So after all the shit was settled and I thought all her stuff was gone I found what has to be $1500 worth of brand new, sealed product tucked away in a closet in the garage. I thought about giving it to her but figured that would lead to more calls with lawyers because the last time I tried to give her something back pre-divorce she accused me of hiding things from her which cost us dozens of hours of lawyer and investigator time to figure out what else I was \"hiding.\" Seriously. Fuck her. But I didn't want to just dump $1500 of high end skin product so I figured I'd give it to my sister or something. \n\nSo because I'm a pretty pathetic divorcee, I eat at the Subway around the corner from my house 6 nights a week, maybe 7. A month or so ago a new girl started working there. I would guess 18 or 19 and stunningly gorgeous and also very sweet. She knows my name, she's acts like she's happy to see me, she doesn't judge me for gaining 30lbs eating their heart clogging food. I mean this when I say this...I have ZERO designs on her romantically. I'm too old, I'm too fat and I don't even think my dong works after being emasculated in the divorce. I am deadly seriously when I say this. Subway girl is a nice person who gives me a couple of minutes of happiness every day and that will always be the extent of our relationship. \n\nDespite her spectacular bone structure, piercing blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair, Subway girl has really bad acne. And as much as I think she's super cool, I really get the feeling that it affects her confidence. To be very honest, this girl should be out dating, having a great time, being the bell of the ball and not serving me Spicy Italians at 9pm on a Friday and although I don't know, I think her skin has something to do with why she chooses to work so much instead of go out. Again...all presumptions on my part and maybe very assholey of me. \n\n\nSo I decided wow, this is way too big of a serendipitous moment to pass up. I have boxes and boxes of expensive acne treatment and I know a super cool person who really could use the stuff. I decided that I'd just give it to her. After I thought about a little bit I figured me just walking and handing her the products really would be creepy and give some sort of implication that I wanted something in return from her. Again...I do not. \n\n\nSo I typed out an anonymous note and said basically \"Subway Girl, I work as a distributor for Paula's Choice Skin Care Products. I have a ton of extra product older product left over and would love for you to have it. Unfortunately, I would get fired if the company found out I was giving the stuff away and I hate to see it go to waste so I must remain anonymous. But you have always been so nice and courteous to me that it's yours free of charge. If you find it works for you it can be purchased on Amazon as well as Paula's Choice dot com. There are detailed instructions on how and when to use the product, enjoy! \" And then shipped it to her via USPS care of the store so I knew she would get it. \n\n\nI can actually tell she's using it because just like it did for my ex, her skin improved dramatically almost overnight. She has not acted any differently towards me so I know for a fact she doesn't think it was me. She has no reason to and very simply I felt good about doing a nice thing for a nice person. \n\n\nUntil my sister found out. My sister doesn't need the product so it's not a jealousy that I gave it away...it's that my sister thinks I am an incredible creep for what I did. She says no matter what I say outloud, I'm secretly hoping this young girl will know what I did and sleep with me. She said plus, by giving acne product to a girl with acne I was pointing out that she had a major flaw and was not a cute person. My sister then passed all this to my mom and grandma and now they both think I'm a creepy asshole who made this girl feel bad. \n\n\nI can add any info if needed but...am I the asshole?\n",

It was my birthday so we threw quite a big party, lots of people, booze, beer pong you name it. \n\nWhen we were out of booze, some of my flatmates suggested I could go to the liquor store 10 meters away from the flat to resupply. I was a bit taken aback by the request and calmly said I was reluctant (money wasn't and issue)\n\n They asked me why I didn't like this idea and I explained them: In the place i've been raised and in all the birthday parties I have attended (mines or friends), the person whose birthday it was didn't have to spend a single Euro on anything because it was entirely up to the guests to buy everything. (In a house party setting, if I was celebrating in a bar, I would pay for my own drinks unless a friend offered to pay me one.)\n\nThey basically told me, since they bought me the presents, I could at least contribute to the party in some way. I was flabbergasted by such an argument , thinking it was super rude to phrase it that way.\n\n There was a bit back and forth but since it was my birthday I didn't wanna make a fuss about it and act entitled so I just went to buy the beers (and it was freaking cheap anyway). I spent a wonderful night, got shitfaced, and got really nice presents from my friends so everything went well and all was forgotten quite fast. \n\nI wasn't sure if it was a cultural thing because one my fellow French flatmates agreed with the fact that you should also buy supplies on your own bday. Maybe it was the exchange student setting where even though it's  bday party, we organize it as a regular one anyway so everybody contributes, I dunno. Maybe you guys have the answer!\n\nSo, should I have been reluctant to buy booze on my own birthday party ? Did that make me TA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

At 6 am, I noticed that we were missing an important part of a drawing project due later. I hadn't noticed before.\n\nI texted F and she got mad that I didn't tell her sooner. I figured she wouldn't fix it (school lends us PCs &amp; wacoms, and we had two free periods so there shouldn't have been an issue), so I did a quick painting over my template (she was supposed to follow it so this wouldn't happen). I didn't use F's drawing bc I thought it would be rude to change it. \n\n\nFastforward to 30 minutes before the class, we're sitting in a classroom. G and other 2 students were there. I showed F what I had done in those 2 periods. Once again, F brought up that it was my fault for answering so late. I told her \"you had the time and means\". F got mad and continued talking loudly. Then, F got angry at T over the gc for not submitting the image to the teacher. No one had told T to send it, but we all assumed he was going to. I told F something like \"you can't expect T to send the image when you didn't even send it to him through e-mail. You sent a low-resolution jpg in the gc.\" \n\nShe got louder \"No one told me to send it. How was I supposed to know?\" I thought this was hypocritical of her and told her \"You already know the gc sends low-quality images.

We both graduated in June and he went to college a little over and hour away from where we're from. \n\nMe and my others friends started boxing a couple of months ago and we've been sparring on the weekends. So I texted this particular friend and asked him if he would like to spar on the weekend. He said yes and I told him that he would have to buy handwraps and a mouthguard and he said that he could do that. We texted a little more about when we would pick him up from college and we decided that my brother and I would drive to his college which is an hour away on Friday, then when we got back to the town we're all from we would go to the store and buy all the stuff he needed and then spar at my house. \n\nSo come friday we drive up to his school, pick him up, and on the way back to where we're from he tells us he forgot his wallet. At this point we're like 10 minutes away from home so we decide we could do it the next day. Then later I'm on snapchat and see his story. He's at a party getting drunk and high with his other friends. I don't think much of because he's been my friend for 10 years why would he lie about something so insignificant. \n\nThe next day comes around and I text him and ask him if he was ready to be picked up and go to Dick's (sports store). He texts me back and says he's at a funeral and probably wouldn't be able to make it. \n\nAt this point I start thinking. So I check snapchat again and look at the snap map which is basically a gps tracker that tells you where your friends are. I look at it and it says he's in his way back to where he goes to school. So I text him and ask him if he's at the funeral right now. He texts me back and says yes. Then I ask him where the funeral is. He says it's in a town 40 minutes south of where we are from. Where he goes to school is an hour north of where we are from. So I begin to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that he is lying. I double check the snap map an hour or so later, he's at his school. So he 100% lied to me about having a dead relative so he could get out of boxing me and use my brother and I as a free ride.\n\nThere are two things I don't tolerate whatsoever no matter how small the infraction is. Fucking with my money, and disloyalty to me, or any of my friends. (Some people think I'm an asshole for this but for me it's based solely on principle).\n\nThis \"friend\" of mine, cost me money (two hours worth of gas), and completely lied to me about his aunt dying. \n\nFor those who don't know sparring is usually relatively light and you're not trying to injure your sparring partner. However my plan is to pretend to be his friend until we step into the ring and completely beat the shit out of him for 12 rounds while he's expecting light sparring. \n\nFor reference we're both 6'2, he's 150 pounds and his only for of exercise is smoking weed, I'm 165 pounds and workout 2-3 times per week and work a very physical job. So he doesn't really stand a chance.\n\nTLDR: A long term friend of mine lied to me about having a funeral so he could use my brother and I as a free ride home from where he goes to college and now I plan on beating the shit out of him.",

They were being defensive.   \n\n\nIt's kind of eating at me, though. :( Is it really me who is the asshole to call someone out- even jokingly- on making the store a messier place?

I ask if I can drop off my gift to her and leave then. He says just give him the gift and he'll give it to her Sunday from me. Me being the unsuspecting sucker that I am agreed.\n\nAfter school today however, I see who else but David and Danielle in line for the bus. David says something along the lines of he has an early gift for her to hold her over till Sunday, and lo and behold, it's the earring box I handed off to him. I had to sit there in complete disbelief at the fact that he just did that. (On the bright side though, she loved the gift) About an hour ago I texted her telling her about this, and she has refused to believe a word of it. She thinks I'm a liar when I tell her the earrings were from me, and she thinks I'm just being jealous still, but no she also called me an asshole for accusing David of stealing.\n\nI'm so fed up with David and everything surrounding him, but I feel like I may lose my best friend over it at this point.

Gray and Blue are apparently close now, to the point where Gray goes off unhinged whenever Blue is upset in any way.\n\nOver the course of the summer, my friendship had been deteriorating with Blue and Gray slowly.

It escalated into arguments where they would both team up against me, because they don't want to even consider my words. No one ever went out of the way to tell me something was wrong, and instead waited until the next day to tell me. I felt ashamed and disrespected because of it. They then slowly started implementing new things to not get me to act up, which only infuriated me more and more until it somehow got decided that not telling me anything at all about problems was for the best.

Plus 2 car payments, student loans, etc. You know, the typical bills everyone is overwhelmed with. My boyfriend makes close to 60k a year where I make closer to 35k. Our mortgage is roughly 1800 a month. We have a daughter together and I have 2 other daughters from a previous relationship. Currently, he refuses to get a joint account. I\u2019ve tried to push combining our finances but he refuses at this point. I believe it\u2019s because he distrusts me with money. So he currently pays for the mortgage, car insurance and his phone bill. I pay for everything else. The electric, water, both car payments, internet, Netflix subscription, daycare costs, our mutually shared credit card (that we used to pay for renovations in our home) and any other expense you can think of incurring. I foolishly wracked up over $6000 on a credit card by buying items for our home such as a new mattress and other household items. I can\u2019t remember the last time I purchased something for myself, alone. Everything I purchase benefits all members of the family or is used by the family. I also have an agreement with my ex that I will claim the kids and give him a percentage that matches the amount time that he has the kids, so about 40% of what I received for the two oldest. \n\nNow, I did get a decent amount of money back this year. I was really excited at being able to pay my credit card off and having money left over for savings as it just makes me feel secure having it in there. Well, my boyfriend asked for his half of the return for the children since he provides for them also. So after paying off my credit card and giving him his portion. I now have only $300 in my bank account. Am I wrong for being pissed for having give this to him? Every pay period, I am struggling to keep my head above water with all the bills I pay. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about how I understand he thinks it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d for us to pay 50/50 of the bills. But I think he struggles to comprehend that I also make nearly half of what he does. I\u2019m constantly scraping by every month and never seem to be able save any money. \n\nAm I the asshole for being disgruntled and pissed off for having to give him half, leaving me with virtually no left over money for my own security?

Even when we were dating she slowed us down once, then did it twice after we broke up. I just feel so strange about this scenario and I almost feel like I\u2019m being strung along or something. Would I be an asshole if I just totally called things off right now? I feel bad because I really like her, and she does seem to like me but there\u2019s just something that she\u2019s not telling me that really makes this situation feel strange. ",

She tried to arrange having me come to her sister's wedding afterparty, but due to logistics and everything it wasn't completely guaranteed that it would happen. The day of the wedding, she messages me saying to come by. Now, this is a big deal to me since this would be the first time meeting her parents and family. In addition, I knew absolutely no one at this wedding, so you can imagine how that would give me some anxiety. \n\nWhen I arrive, it's past 9:30, the dancing seems to have peaked, with the first guests starting to leave. Everyone is quite drunk, I tend to shy away from tons of alcohol. The girl I'm dating seems drunk asks me to bring her a drink, which I do. She then asks me to bring her a drink two more times, after I say things like \"you sure?\". I'm feeling a little strange since I've never seen her drunk before and she's behaving quite differently. In addition, I've had some really shitty past experiences with an ex who was borderline verbally abusive to me when drunk, and I just wasn't feeling it that night. \n\n I spend about an hour dancing with the family, bride, and whoever else hasn't left yet, and then I tell her I'm thinking of heading home for the night soon. She straight up tells me I can't leave, and that she will get really upset if I do. She then asks me to do some random tasks which I do, like moving wedding supplies into the car and trying to stop the dance floor from dying out. I try to leave a few more times, but she makes it clear that it's going to be really bad if I leave. I end up leaving at around 1:30am. \n\nThe next day I told her that it was weird of her to force me to stay when I wasn't having a good time, and that she should be fine without me there since all her friends and family are gathered at the wedding, whereas I knew no one and it was a weird atmosphere to meet the family. She said that arriving and wanting to leave so soon isn't something you do. I'm not sure how to respond. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I lived with my mum majority of the time and saw my father every second weekend.\n\nIt\u2019s been going on for a while where I would plead with mum to not take me to my father\u2019s house. I was 12 when I first asked to take me home instead because I didn\u2019t want to go. There\u2019s so many reasons to list why, but in summary; he picked on my weight - subtle digs here and there, roll his eyes whenever I said something and never made me feel appreciated or loved. I\u2019ve never heard him say that he was proud of me despite my achievements. There\u2019s so many more things to go on about, like how he didn\u2019t come to important events in my life, like my 18th birthday, or how he would prevent my mum from swapping weekends around so I could spend time with family. \n\nMy father got into a relationship with his now fianc\u00e9e 3 years ago. About 10 months ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent surgery and the cancer was removed. She\u2019s in the process of radiation treatment now and is slowly getting better.\n\nLast time I saw them, we went into the city and it was fine. He made some horrible remarks about how much money he makes which made the day turn sour. Like I mentioned before, his fianc\u00e9e is currently undergoing treatment for her cancer and so she has had to have some time off work up until recently. He made a \u2018joke\u2019 about how he \u201cmakes more money at home on the couch than she does at work\u201d and how he has \u201cbeen holding up this family.\u201d This made me so angry because he has never provided for me and he was belittling his fianc\u00e9e. My father never offered to pay for my books for high school or uniforms. My mother supported me to get to where I am now by herself. The only time he would pay for anything was when she begged him to. My mum is a single parent, who up to very recently had a small income that only went to the necessities and she really struggled with anything else. So, it\u2019s fair to say that I didn\u2019t see much support from him.\n\nI decided to stop speaking to him from that moment forward. I had removed him from Facebook and haven\u2019t had any contact with him since I saw him in January. Monday just gone, I had gotten a phone call around 9:30pm from his fianc\u00e9e. I was an emotional wreck, talking about my father the last few months has been a major trigger point for me and causes panic attacks and breakdowns. It\u2019s not pretty. She told me that her cancer has a high likelihood of coming back and that she has a 6% chance of survival on the next 5 years.\n\nAfter that call, I was in hysterics. I had to explain to her why I didn\u2019t want to see them because of my father and I was just told she may not be here in 5 years time. \n\ntl;dr: My father made my life hell, I cut him off, I found out my step mum has a small chance of living in the next 5 years after speaking to them for the first time in 2 months.",

AWTA?\n\nTL;DR - A friend recently became a shaman or whatever, me and my friends got to talking about him in general after having a laugh about the shaman stuff. Turns out we all think he's creepy, a huge leech, and we all made sort of a group decision to stop associating with him en masse. Am I, and my friends the assholes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I work full time and sleep early so I\u2019m never really home and I NEVER throw parties or act loud in absolutely any way other maybe dropping something here or there which is to be expected when living in an apartment. These two clearly live of welfare as they are home 24/7 and seem to take up entertaining themselves by calling the police on me every week and complaining about how extremely loud I am and I won\u2019t let them sleep. They bang on on the ceiling and scream at me at 3 am while I\u2019m sleeping (and have to wake up at 6 am) and claim that I\u2019m being extremely loud and bothersome. One time they call the police on me for being loud while I was OUT on vacation. The condo manager entered my apartment only to find an empty place. Lately these two have been keeping me up because the son will be screaming at the mother for hours, sometimes it sounds like furniture is being thrown around. These don\u2019t sound like little disagreements, but full on screaming fit to the point where he\u2019s losing his voice. I decided that I had enough and took it upon myself to report the son for what seems to be elder abuse and asked if the police can \u201ccheck up\u201d on them. In my mind I feel like it\u2019s fair as it does sound pretty bad down there and I\u2019m hoping these police visits every now and then will show them that I\u2019m sick of being harassed by them.  Also want to add that I have tried approaching them when i ran into them at the parking lot, but they felt threatened and called a private investigator on me who told me that\u2019s i am never allowed to approach them or I will be \u201carrested\u201d",

            "input": "  \n\nSo, today newish RGM pulls me aside in the morning along with the AGM, and I could tell I was in trouble, but I hadn't the slightest clue what it could've been about. Well, they tell me that my coworker/crush of a little over a year complained about me sexually harassing her. I feel it should be pointed out that this is the day after our new RGM has had one-on-ones with the staff to try to find/solve some under-the-hood issues that you don't noticed/don't have time to address mid-shift, with one of the questions during said event being \"have you noticed or had any problems with sexual harassment?\" Paraphrasing, \"It''s been brought to my attention that you've been repeatedly asking out coworker/crush despite her telling you no each time, and that is sexual harassment..\" and you get the idea.\n\nLet me just say that each and every time I asked (at least 4 times over 13 months.) she never gave me a straight answer. The most recent example being from two days ago, which went like this.\n\nMe: Do you have Valentine's day plans?\n\nHer: Hmmm, maybe. I don't know. Why?\n\nMe: Well, if you don't, I'd like to treat you to dinner.\n\nHer: Yeah, I know.\n\nThen I just kind of accepted the rejection - because that's what it was if history is anything to go by - as I'm used to by now and walked away to get back to work. She's not the first nor will she be the last, I'm sure.\n\nSo, yesterday being Valentine's day, I'd gone to the florist the day prior and bought just a rose and a card to write a little corny poem for her. I gave them to her when she came in that day, because whether she wanted to go to dinner or not, my feelings were the same either way. What mattered wasn't the outcome, just the simple idea that she meant enough to me to warrant a special gift on a day like Valentine's day. I didn't bring the date up again, I just gave them to her and wished her well and went back to work. Whether this was the last straw, or it just happened to be an unfortunate coincidence with the questioning and V-day is something I ponder, but is ultimately irrelevant to the discussion I suppose.\n\nIt was never my intention to make her feel like I was sexually harassing her; I often go out of my way to stay out of her proximity and keep out of conversations she's part of. Partially to give her space and partially because it's my own defense mechanism that keeps me from making an ass of myself in front of her. I honestly feel really conflicted with how this shook out, because on the one hand I don't feel like I did something wrong enough to warrant the penalty, but I don't feel like I'm absolutely faultless either. I definitely could have \"taken the hint\" or resolved that if she wanted to see me, she would have said yes/remembered in the first place. Truthfully, I wish she'd said \"No, I'm not/will never be interested,\" the first time so that I could have tried to move on instead of nursing a glimmer of hope in the back of my mind for the better part of a year.\n\nAITA for having hope",

I\u2019m a programmer that doesn\u2019t easily trust people, he\u2019s a big tough exec with a big personality but is soft and loving to me. (Full discloser he\u2019s as old as my dad.) This wasn\u2019t my plan but damn he\u2019s hot and we were so happy together I don\u2019t want kids, so we got married in 2015. Everyone was happy.\n\nJohn had a few long term friends who were former clients. I feel it\u2019s kind of important to point out that his clients are extremely wealthy and no one really says no to them, no one including my husband. I noticed that his friends Tim and Jen didn\u2019t acknowledge me as John true wife, probably because of my age. When we are sitting together they\u2019d invite John to events knowing I would come, they didn\u2019t thank me for house warming gives, they thanked John. Or if something went wrong they would apologize to him but not me. These aren\u2019t a big deal so I didn\u2019t care but I did mention to John they didn't think of me as equal.\n\n**Information Key:**  \nJohn = my husband  \nTracy = me  \nTim and Jen = husband's longtime friends  \nMr. Dunn = Jen's ex-husband\n\nMore recently they started negating or contradicting any point I tried to make. It was like was obsolete or something. I told John that I didn\u2019t think Tim and Jen liked me and I wanted to bow out of the upcoming trip to Italy but he should go with them. John insisted I come because he loves me and wants me by his side. \u201cJust be yourself\u201d he told me, because \"I love you\".\n\nSo I went. Tim and Jen picked at me the whole time. By the 4th day in Italy I pointed out that they were picking at me constantly. Tim turned to me and said \u201cYou\u2019re being really sensitive right now \u2026 Do you have many friends?\u201d he went on being really condescending\u2026 Telling me he has a hard time relating to me that he wanted me to be different, warmer, funnier, like one of his friends. I was kind of shocked at the questions and comments but went on unfazed. They instantly adjusted their attitude for the rest of the trip and I played nice. It was fine, we landed in the states and I never saw them again.\n\nNow John has seen first hand that they were being really rude to me. Once in a while we would joke to each other \u201cYou\u2019re being really sensitive\u2026 Do you have many friends?!\u201d LOL Tim and Jen texted and called but John was unresponsive. Then 2 months later on Dec 4th, John fires off an email basically telling them \u2018when you hurt my wife, you hurt me.\u2019 Then John stops responding.\n\n[Tim responds angrily with in hours](https://imgur.com/XJcbqe9) on Dec 4th\n\n[Then Time responds again the next day with some \u2018retrospect\u2019](https://imgur.com/Jbxhg4r) on Dec 5th\n\nThen [Jen texts John](https://imgur.com/ZmOllYH) on Dec 8th\n\nIt really seems like in no uncertain terms they never liked me, were always only friends with John, and are now coyly suggesting John divorce me and be friends with them again?! WTF I never did anything to them. I was always giving, polite and nice.\n\nThe thing is John and I really love each other and have no intention of splitting.

They emphasized the many facts that they will not help me in any way (buying stuff, dog-sitting, training, etc) which I didn't mind, I have always wanted a furbaby and I wanted the responsibility of training him to be the best doggo ever.\n\nThe first few months was all great, I learned so much and implemented everything I've learned from dog training courses, videos online, advice from friends who have dogs, all that good stuff. Since my doggo is a fairly large breed, it is more difficult to address some issues. I've tried positive reinforcement all the way but it only went so far.. so my private trainer suggested to use a pinch collar. I was hesitant to use this but after a few training sessions with this, the obedience changed for the better and the issues gradually got easier to deal with such as tugging during walks. The trainer suggested not to let him play with other dogs yet since he is still trying to master obedience.\n\nSo after the 6 months mark, my parents grew to love the dog soo much that they started spoiling him like crazy when I am not present. My mom would give him treats non-stop cause he would give those cute freaking puppy eyes.. My mom calls me cold-hearted because I would ask the dog to do tricks (obedience training) before I give him a reward. I want to enforce the training so he is not spoiled and has to earn his treats even if the command is something simple like \"sit\" or \"down\". My parents also love to walk him, but they don't enforce the pinch collar during walks. So the dog is tugging left and right, he's leading them everywhere, he's eating crap off the ground, he's plopping on the ground and refusing to leave, etc. \n\nAt this point, this dog KNOWS who and when he can take advantage of - he would basically revert back to the behavior prior the pinch collar if hes around my parents. My parents would complain to me, asking me why he's acting this way and why he's such an angel when he's with me. They would compare my dog to others asking why can't I train him to be obedient like other dogs. I told them bluntly that it is because they don't enforce the training, and that I do. They still didn't listen to me after I told them this fact. \n\nI found out that my mom has been letting him play with other dogs on walks, even after I told her not to yet since we are still trying to master obedience. She lets him off-leash and he goes running towards other dogs.. I told her that I don't like if the dog is off-leash unless it's in an enclosed area. What if the other dog he's running towards is aggressive? What if the other dog's owner doesn't like dogs being off-leash? She then continues to call me crazy, and that I am making the dog unhappy. One of the main reason that I am overly upset right now is because my mom told me that the dog saw other dogs from the other side of the park and he went running towards them- leading to the fall of my mom and letting go cause of severe leash burn. I've tolerated so much regarding about the dog but my mom just continues not to listen and tells me that I'm being a bad owner and that I don't care about his well-being. I got so fed up that I regretfully yelled at my mom and now she's crying.. and giving me the silent treatment. All my dog training literally went down the toilet.\n\nSorry for the long post, but AITA for yelling at mom because I just want her to enforce the training so he doesn't go all crazy and takes advantage of her? I know she just wants the dog to be happy.",

I recently started going to therapy for these problems and yesterday i finally admitted to my boyfriend everything i\u2019ve lied to him about in our relationship. We didn\u2019t break up and he basically just said he really needed time to think about everything and consider how we can best go forward and rebuild the trust between us. I started getting really anxious waiting for him to get out of work to talk so i decided to go to the neighboring city to distract myself. It\u2019s about 45 minuets away. I locked my keys out of my car and so I tried to call a lock smith but it was too expensive.  So then i tried to call the police but there was an event going on so they didn\u2019t have squad cars to send to me, so the most they could do for me was call a tow truck to come unlock it and i would be responsible for the payments. I texted my friends who weren\u2019t working and they were at school. Around this time my boyfriend was going on break so I told him the situation and he texted his best friend but he was at an event and wasn\u2019t in town for the day. At this point he started telling me it sounded like i was lying.  So i sent him pictures of my car and the stores around me and my location being in that city. He told me if i was telling the truth i could wait until after he got out of work and i would have no issue with that if i was telling the truth. This all happened at about 3pm and he doesn\u2019t get out of work until 10pm. I didn\u2019t know what else to do so i just sat on the curb and waited. Finally he gets out of work and asks me where i am and i tell him in the exact same spot. He drives to me and finds me. I was extremely upset at him because the temperature dropped to around 40 and he left me stranded in a parking lot for hours. But i also understand it was a real boy who cried wolf situation. So. AMITA for being super upset at my boyfriend for this? Or did he have a right to not believe me?",

At one of our sites, I'll refer to as S, I was there for about 8 months before the contract got sold to another company and I went to another site. Fast forward 4 months, I quit and went to the company that got site S. \n\nOne of the first people I met was a former, now current, coworker. He works 1st shift, I work 2nd shift. 1st shift is a nightmare mess anyway, but yeah. \n\nI am a bit of a workaholic, and in my second and third week, I've taken on 36 hours of Overtime, my gf moved to another state for school, and it's just me and the cat, so I spend a lot of time working, simply because it's a better use of my time (college is in the works but I am in a bit of debt by biting off an apartment more than we could chew and I will be moving, but I gotta stockpile cash) than sitting around playing video games or whatever. The coworker, referred to as W, only works 25.5 hours a week. \n\nI come in today, and my supervisor comes in very soon after, because he was checking in on the building. As soon as he comes in, he asks me why I've been late every day since I started. \n\nWell, this strikes me as odd, and my coworker for my shift backs me up, saying I've never been late working 2nd shift. In fact, the only time I was late, I made certain to call and let the supervisor for that shift know I was running behind schedule. \n\nSupervisor then tells me \"Well, W on first shift calls me every day and blows the supervisor phone up complaining that you're always late.\"\n\nSo now I plan on making certain to show up early, and make sure that everything has been done to a perfect T, and should anyone leave even a second before their scheduled time, I'm reporting them for abandoning post, as I have not started my shift, and will not be held responsible for their carelessness, while simultaneously dragging my name through the mud. \n\nWould this make me the asshole, considering I will be as nitpicky as humanly possible, to the smallest detail?

Naturally being in a shared housing the other guys want to use it too. They play shared screen games while I pretty much play only singleplayer games but I had no problem sharing since we're all friends and they pay for any extra controllers. One month the electricity bill came in and it was noticeably higher than normal, the other guys starts to point fingers at me because I play singleplayer games for long intervals (i.e how they're meant to be played). They all collectively agreed that I should pay the difference in the electricity bill compared to last month, so $25. I thought it was bullshit that they automatically pinned the blame on me playing using the console and disregarded any other possibility (i.e leaving the dryer on for too long).   \n\n\nAlso I thought there's no way a full-time student is going to have enough time to use it enough for the $25 increase in the bill.

I brought this up to them later and they pretty much ignored it, but oh lucky me they agreed to split it evenly as a \"courtesy\".

The other guys get to use it without paying because they're \"sharing\" between 4 people. I thought it was ridiculous that I'm the only one who has to pay to use the console that I bought with my own pocket money and they don't.

Now that we have 4, we had a carefully balanced schedule where one of us got off, then switched kids, then the other worked.  We still managed to get one day off together.  And let me add this: through promotion I became her manager.  So to the story.\n\nThis past weekend, St. Patricks, is our busiest weekend of the year.  We are a restaurant and bar.  She and I have been fighting from Friday night until Sunday.  Towards the end of the night she is getting miffed and tells me she quits.  She has been unhappy there for a couple of months now.  I really needed her to work through St Patricks, we were short staffed as it were.  And then she pops this.  She's done.  \n\nThe next day I am going to make the schedule.  I realize I have 2 other servers out, so I will be super short during the coming weekend.  I talk to her about putting her on the schedule.  \"I told you, I don't want to go back to working there.\"\n\n\"Well what are you going to do for money?\"\n\n\"I have another job.\" And bam, the next day, Tuesday, she starts working at an office job.  I really don't think she planned it in advanced, the girl who got her the job worked the saturday and Sunday she was on.  \n\nBut I feel upset because we had a tightly crafted schedule, juggling the kids and still managed a day off together.  She didn't bring this up with me beforehand.  I work 4p-3am Tuesday through Sunday.  Now she is working 9a-5p and we will never see each other, and there is no way we will ever have Monday off together.  I feel like she was completely inconsiderate of my feelings, she screwed me on my work schedule, she didn't give me a real notice and completely shifted how our life is going to  without considering me.  I told her she can deal with getting the kids and deal with watching them, since she just changed my life with no input, made my job more difficult and alienated me.  \n\nShe countered that I am \"being controlling and treating her like a child.\"  But I don't think it is wrong for me to feel hurt.  It is very hard for her and I to cooperate on things.  We both come off as critical. I am upset.  Am I the asshole? I don't mind her changing jobs, but don't drop it on me overnight and screw me at the place I am responsible for staffing because in the end, it doesn't hurt the bar it hurts me.

She was actually cheating on her then fianc\u00e9 with him so it was very hush hush. They had a falling out because her fianc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t let her go, he slept with another girl and she got mad and they stopped talking. She eventually broke up with her fianc\u00e9 and moved away from her home town where my friend also lived. \n\nAnyway about August this year he reached to her and they\u2019ve been talking again. I didn\u2019t know the girl even existed because I met this guy in February this year and he never bought her up until about August when he sent pictures of her dog, and other picture she sent him, onto me. He\u2019s said that\u2019s he\u2019s never stopped loving her. She now apparently moving back to town so they can properly date again. \n\nA week ago he got mad at me because every time he sent me a picture of what she sent him I\u2019d reply with \u201ck cool, or cute, okay sweet\u201d and that\u2019s it. He then accused me of hating the girl because of my \u201cdisrespectful responses\u201d which I replied with \u201cI don\u2019t care about her at all, little own hate her\u201d. It was meant as I\u2019m indifferent to her - which I explained directly after my \u201cI don\u2019t care about her\u201d comment. \n\nHe then got REALLY mad saying that he doesn\u2019t want someone in his life that doesn\u2019t care about his SO who is a big and important part of his life. He\u2019s now blocked me on Facebook but I\u2019ve tried talking via normal text and whilst it\u2019s \u201cseen\u201d there\u2019s no response... \n\nAm I the asshole? Or is he overreacting about my not caring? I explained straight after it meant as indifference when he accused me of hating her - I have bigger things in life to focus energy on then a girl Ive never met. \n\nBut I\u2019m lost as to why the overreaction - or what I think is an overreaction. Outsider insight would be nice! Or maybe I\u2019m just a dick and can\u2019t see it...\n\n",

Also   \n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying my buddy is B and my ex is E\n\nSo B and I have been friends since high school, We\u2019re both 25.  B left for BC after graduation and didn\u2019t see him until 4 years later when he moved back to his moms. We caught up and eventually started hanging out and becoming more like brothers.  \n\nNow he lives in a town about 100km from where I live,  and despite the distance for years i would drive up on a Friday night after work and hang out with him until Sunday evening.  At times when my other buddies would go out i would drive more than halfway to pick him up and bring him along.  He doesn\u2019t drive so as for meeting up I\u2019m the one doing all the driving.   \n\n\nNow when he moved to his moms,  he met a couple girls at his job and one weekend I was up we hung out with both of them.  One of them being E.   He became pretty good friends with both of em, but after the past couple years he\u2019s really only kept in contact with E from time to time.  They would hang out sometimes but it became more frequent when i got involved. \n\nNow we\u2019re at this past October.  Up at his place one morning I had matched with E on a dating app and she reached out to me,  from there on we started talking, more and more each day until we decided to become a couple.  B knows full well I\u2019m talking to her, and during all this B ended up breaking things off with his then GF,  to which I withstood crap from E because I wanted to be there for B and help him out through what was a trying time for him instead of seeing her (During all this I would only see her on weekends as she lived in the same town as B). For 7 weeks in a row i drove to and from B\u2019s place on the weekends to see both B &amp; E.  E however explained to me that B, when it was just them two one evening, confided in E that he had feelings for her.  This was while we were still dating mind you,  and she told me that she didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nHere\u2019s where I royally fuck up though,  because I had a fling who also lived in that same town and one Saturday, both B &amp; E were working and against my better judgement we arranged plans to meet up.  At the time I guess i wanted to see her, but when I was driving to her place I couldn\u2019t shake that feeling of guilt and backed out.  I know that it\u2019s a real shitty thing to do, especially because I had it done to me once before.  So later that night she was going through my phone, unbeknownst to me and came across the convo with my old fling.  Of course she was upset with me, and as I\u2019ve been honest so far,  I never felt like more of a piece of shit.  I really do have feelings for her and I answered every question she asked regarding my old fling.  We came to the agreement that we were still going to try and make it work.  I took all the shit she gave me and then some.  I even drove up after work on a Tuesday to see her to at least show her that I\u2019m trying my best to make things better.  But sometimes your best isn\u2019t enough.   \n\n3 weeks after my fuck up,  i was talking with her on the phone on a Sunday evening and she tells me that she can\u2019t stop thinking about me and that fling.  So we agreed to \u201cstart over\u201d.  Her words not mine.  \n\nDuring that following week,  i could tell she was just losing more interest everyday, and (i dont do it anymore) I saw on Snapchat that she was at B\u2019s place pretty muc everyday that week.   On the Friday I\u2019m driving home,  call her and chat for a little bit. I could tell something was up.  And after our call,  she then proceeds to ask me if I remember that night we talked about B and how he told her he liked her.  Then says that she doesn\u2019t just like him \u201cshe\u2019s in love with that idiot\u201d.  Idk but i just sorta lost it.  I had to pull over because my head was spinning and I just wanted to scream.  I was under the impression we were \u201cstarting over\u201d and not actually ending things. \n\nEverything I\u2019ve done the past several years B has been involved.  We were inseparable, and I don\u2019t have anyone else who I\u2019m as close with like i am with him.  \n\nBasically that whole weekend and next week B doesn\u2019t say boo to me.  In fact he acts like everything is ok.  I had to bring it up and he just asks \u201coh what\u2019s wrong buddy? Is it E &amp; I? Does that bother you?\u201d\n\nI lost it on him because yes it bothers me and how in the flying fuck do you think that it wouldnt.  I\u2019m the kind of guy that wears my heart on my sleeve and he more than anyone knows that.  Or at least I thought.  Within a week when she told me about B they were already posting pics on social media and the like.  It really hurt my feelings,  not because she just up and leaves but because my buddy didn\u2019t have a single shred of doubt that what he was doing was wrong,  or that I would be perfectly fine with them dating.  \n\nI can\u2019t think of either of them without the other and it\u2019s been constantly bothering me.  I told him that I don\u2019t think I can come up to see him like i used to, and that i just need to time to sorta work this shit out.  He doesn\u2019t seem to mind because he still is with her pretty much everyday now and he doesn\u2019t reach out to me at all. \n\nI apologize for the block of text,  but i just need a third party\u2019s\u2019 opinion on this because I want to see B again, and hang out with him and his family,  because I\u2019m like another son to them,  but I\u2019m angry that he\u2019d done something like that to me.   I wish he would have at least talked to me about it before,  it seems that they\u2019d always had these feeings for each other but decided to act on it right after I date her.  Again,  I\u2019m not wanting to downplay what i did,  i know it was wrong and I took a long look at myself and knew that\u2019s who I didn\u2019t want to be. But i also dont want to just pretend everything is ok between B &amp; I because this just hits me right in the heart.  B would be the the guy i go to whenever I had issues with a girl and now he\u2019s become directly involved.  I still havent seen either of them and this was the week before Christmas this happened.  \n\nSo AITA for possibly not talking to B or hanging out with him again? Should I just try to come to terms with it and move on? I don\u2019t know what to do\n",

So I had a big crush on this girl for over a year, let's call her Maria and him John. One day, after school, me and John were on our way to grab something to eat, when we randomly bumped into Maria and asked her if she wanted to come with us to eat, which she did. Once I was done, I had to leave as I had a Chemistry lesson, while both of them continued eating. (Mind you, I was a senior in High School and I was taking the exams in June). Fast forward to July, I was done with my exams and a female friend of mine told me that there were rumours that Maria and John went out on a date, and the first thing that came to my mind was that day I just mentioned. So I told her that the rumours are false and they never went on a date, they just simply ate for a bit together once I left the store. At the time, my friend knew very well that I had a crush on her and I was so sure that John would never do such a thing and I didn't even give it a second thought. The same friend that told me about the rumour, bumped into Maria one day and Maria asked my friend if she knew about the rumours, which it turned out to be true. So she told me, and then I asked a really close friend, both I's and John's, if he knew anything about the situation, let's call him Ted. So Ted told me that Maria and John had been talking to each other since last December and that they went on a date where they made out. When John told Ted that he had been talking with Maria and was planning a date, Ted told John that he had to tell me, which he did not want to do because ''it would had affected my exams preparation'' so Ted didn't tell me even thought he insisted. When I found out , I was lost. To this day, I really can't believe, that my best friend of 13 years would make out with my biggest crush behind my back without telling me literally nothing. It's not about Maria, fuck Maria I ,now, couldn't care less, its all about honesty and being a decent fucking friend, let alone homie.\n\nSome of you may think: '' Oh come on man you would have done the same thing\" and I'll tell you something to show you how much friendship and honesty means to me.\n\nOne night, I had a girl literally all over me, but she was an ex- girlfriend of a friend of mine, who is a really cool dude but we were far from close friends. So I said fuck it, Im not hooking up with her it's not right, at least according to my morals, so I was trying to kill time while she was all over me, until we left the club.\n\nIf that was really about not trying to upset me during my preparation then he would have told me after I was done with them, right? Well he had time but he did not.\n\nI do not hold any grudges nor hard feelings, I simply don't want to have this kind of people around me. To this day, he hasn't even said a simple '' I'm sorry''.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My wife 3 month old daughter were going to visit my family out of state on their way to visiting me on my work trip. A couple of days before the trip my mom tells my wife that during her visit they are going to visit my grandparents. My grandmother is a huge chain smoker, and to make matters worse she smokes indoors. My daughter has recently recovered from pneumonia and croup, so my wife was not on board with being stuck in a smoker\u2019s house for several hours. (It was early winter, so going outside to hang out was not an option). \n\nThis started a big shit show between my parents and my wife. My mom (who has asthma btw) claimed that she grew up in a smokers house so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. My step dad and mom claimed that my wife was \u201ca new mother\u201d and that she was being overprotective. My wife tried to explain to them the dangers of secondhand smoke over the phone and through shared articles, but they took it as here acting snobby. While it sucked being in the middle of this, I sided with my wife. Long story short she didn\u2019t visit them that winter, and as far as I know my parents never told my grandparents why. \n\nFast forward to this week. My daughter is 19 months old, and still has issues. We actually have an appointment to see a pediatric pulmonologist this month. Oh and my wife is 20 weeks pregnant. We are planning a trip to visit my family. My grandparents are in a new house, but grandma still smokes indoors. This time my parents said they \u201cdon\u2019t want to get in the middle of things,\u201d because they know my grandparents are gonna invite us over. They want to leave it up to me to tell them why we won\u2019t. Which is fine I guess. \n\nWIBTA if I tell my grandparents that we aren\u2019t going to visit their house but they can come see us at my parents?

            "input": "This is a long one folks! \n\nI'm in my mid-late twenties, and I live with my mom for a lot of reasons. My sister is in her 30s and is married with a 2 year old kid. My mom and I live pretty close to my sister's family. I'm not sure when exactly it started, but somehow this arrangement developed where my mom and I watch her son basically every weekend. I know this definitely started before his first birthday, and it's continued to today(a few months after his second birthday). If there's 52 weeks in a year, I'm certain I've watched my nephew for over 40 weekends. I'm allowed to make outside plans and they can't/won't really say anything to protest it. It used to mean he wouldn't come, but then it gradually became my mom watching him by herself. Something to note is that unless my mom is running late, all the communication and arrangements for this is between my sister and our mom. I think maybe twice my sister contacted me letting me know the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I recently started a full time job(M-F 40+ hours a week). After my first week, my nephew came over, and then when my sister picked him up on Sunday evening it was around 8pm. I felt burnt out and exhausted, and I kind of had the realization that the reason why I initially didn't mind the arrangement so much was because most of that time was when I was either unemployed, or employed part time. Now I'm in a new field and I'm trying my best to learn more by reading books and taking a udemy class(for the time being) as well. That being said, really what I needed was time to myself, time to decompress and not be stressed out. I kind of realized the part of the deal where I can make weekend plans wasn't that great because, that doesn't account for when I just want to chill out and play video games on the weekend, or even work on my udemy class for that matter(if I stayed at a cafe or something for too long my mom will call telling me to come over asap). The next week he didn't come for a reason that I forgot. And the week after that was last week. When his parents came to pick him up on Sunday I had a somewhat awkward conversation with my sister. I love the boy so it was really hard for me to say that I can't watch him any more(at least this regularly) but it was a hard thing for me to accept. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Hey....I don't think I can do this any more.\n\nSister: Do what?\n\nMe: It just feels like I'm working 7 days a week and saturday and sunday are the most stressful days.\n\nSister: Watching \\[nephew\\]?\n\nMe: Yes\n\nSister: Ok..(looking away)\n\nIt should be noted that her husband was in earshot of this conversation. That was it. They went home, and fast forward to yesterday(Friday). I'm having dinner with my mom and she mentions the nephew. I tell her that I told my sister that I don't want to see him regularly anymore. She starts protesting and arguing with me. Saying things like I don't have to leave my room when he's here(which is BS, he will call for me and look for me, and I can't exactly ignore him when that happens, once he's here, he's here and there's no way to compromise that space). She also says she lives in this house too and she wants to see him so she should get what she wants(although at 40+ weekends a year, I think I should get at least 12 where I get the say, but you can also argue that him being here on the weekend shouldn't even be the default option but I digress, my point is that I should be allowed to refuse every now and again).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich brings me to today, I slept late last night and was woken up to the sound of tiny foot steps running down the hall. My sister is here with her son. I'm..confused, in part because I was woken up abruptly and in part because I'm kind of afraid of pushing the matter and assuming the worst. My sister mentions that their house is getting painted and that they were going to the park soon, and I decide to assume that she was just making a quick stop in the cold weather because they didn't want him around while painting. I ended up taking a nap(because I woke up \"early\") and I wake up to my mom alone with my nephew, sister nowhere in sight. I stop being in denial and text my sister saying that I wasn't expecting him to come over, and that I didn't appreciate that she blatantly ignored what I said about not being able to watch him any more. She just said \"sorry\" and \"ok\". After a bit I just scream in frustration and my nephew sees me and leaves the room(something I'm very ashamed of). I decided enough was enough, I texted both of his parents one thing: \"What time are you picking up \\[nephew\\] tonight?\" Very aggressively not giving them the option to let him sleep over. My sister starts texting me saying she's sorry her son is a burden for me but it feels hurtful the way I communicated it and thanked me for watching him. I told her we need to have a proper conversation to establish boundaries. She mentions I also need to talk to our mom because our mom said he could sleep over. I explain that the short version of the story is that things are different with my new job. My sister suggested she come over on the weekends with him but I explained that that's not going to solve the problem. My sister explains that she just told our mom this morning that he was coming over because they didn't realize how big of a paint job this would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I piece together the facts so far:\n\n1. I did mention to my sister that I can't watch my nephew any more, and granted it wasn't elaborated on, but I definitely said enough to indicate that I'm exhausted.\n2. I told my mom just last night over dinner that I'm exhausted and I don't want to see my nephew specifically this weekend. She argued with me about it but I did make it clear.\n3. My sister called my mom this morning to let her know she was dropping off the nephew at our house.\n4. My mom told my sister it was ok if he spent the night at our home.\n\nIn other words: I told both of them that I'm burnt out and tired and don't want to watch my nephew, and they contacted each other and agreed that he would spend the night. Somewhere(or everywhere), there lies a complete disrespect for me when I brought this up before it would be a problem, and now that I'm making a big fuss they're finally listening very begrudgingly. I told my sister that contacting our mom does NOT count as contacting me. Her yes does not always mean mine and she needs mine too. Anyway they come to pick him up like an hour and a half later, my mom is very upset by this and my brother in law is just awkwardly avoiding talking to me. My sister said they won't be coming next week(they'll be in Miami) and that's kind of where it ended. I'm mentally exhausted, and none of this feels remotely close to resolved, but I really think I need a break from this arrangement and I want my nephew to not see me in this exhausted, low patience, irritable state. My mom accuses me of being mean to the nephew when I'm not holding him accountable for anything and besides the screaming(which to clarify: was not at him, he just saw/heard me scream) I haven't been treating him poorly today.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

There's this guy, let's call him Josh, that has a crush on her. I want to outline here that Josh is an asshole (he gossips, backstabs, and uses people to get what he want, and he's also *so* dramatic) and we've been snapping at each other since freshman year. However, and this is important, we're co-captains of the speech and debate team (he's in charge of speech, I'm in charge of debate). So we have kind of an uneasy peace going.\n\nSo, as it turns out, Josh decided to ask Kallie to prom. She tells me about this and is really mad. I asked why. Here's how our conversation went:\n\nKallie: Well, he asked me out before and I said no\n\nMe: But that was at the beginning of the year. Anyway, what did you say to him then?\n\nKallie: I said I was just really busy and not looking for a relationship, maybe later. \n\nMe: Well that isn't exactly the clearest way to say you have no interest... but what did he say this time. \n\nKallie: *shows me the text he sent her, and it says 'hey, I was wondering if you want to go to prom with me'*\n\nMe: That's not that bad...\n\nKallie: He asked me out even after I clearly said I wasn't interested.\n\nMe: *didn't think this would come up again, so I decided to drop it* Sure\n\nBut a few days later, Josh gets called to the principal's office for 'harrassment'. He says he didn't harrass Kallie in any way. Kallie says he did.\n\nNow, I get dragged into this. Why? I'm Kallie's friend, and co-captain with Josh, and I have a pretty good rep with the teachers and principal, so they call me to ask for another perspective.\n\nSo I had to think about what to say. On one hand, Josh is normally an asshole, and Kallie's my friend. But thinking of it logically: Josh asks her out at the beginning of the year, she instead of being clear about her feelings just gives him a vague answer about being too busy and even says 'maybe later'. He then waits more than half a year without bothering her, and then politely asks her out to prom. That doesn't sound like harrassment to me.\n\nSo that's what I told the principal, and when everyone in the club asked me how I answered the principal, I was honest with what I said. Most people, including Josh, were happy, and most people said I was being reasonable. But a few people, including Kallie, were mad.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I value my friendship with Kallie, but I honestly don't think Josh was harassing her. \n\nAita?\n\n",

My family went out to a really nice restaurant but the food and experience ended up being a disaster. Many things were sold out, drinks were terrible, food was very very late etc. Anyways, they comp'd the entire meal, and of course we say \"alright don't forget to tip the waiters, it wasn't their fault.\" My uncle, who is quite rich, immediately disagrees. Instead of keeping my mouth shut and tipping extra, I argued with him and told him he was wrong in front of the entire family including his kids. It got heated, he had consumed at least 10 tequila shots that day (we are on vacation in Mexico) and he was getting enraged. We finally dropped it and left the restaurant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, then his son felt I think emboldened to keep running his mouth at his father in front of everyone. Calling him out of touch, up on his ivory tower, all sorts of harsh words.

We all have a good time at the show but a few days later I was third wheeling michael and sally and he offhandedly mentions that he bought sally's ticket from William. Both Sally and Michael don't think its a big deal but it makes me upsets me because william made it seems like he gave it to them, but instead he sold it them after he had told me AND michael that he would just give it to sally. I'm not upset that he sold the ticket, I'm upset that he SAID to me and michael that he would just give it to sally, and then later on changed his mind AND lied to me about giving away the ticket after he had sold it to Michael. I brought it up to William once but he blew me off and told me I was overreacting, and I haven't talked to him since. Am I being an overreacting asshole!?  \n\n\nTLDR: Friend **W** said he would give Friend **M**'s gf a free concert ticket since she had the wrong one. When i asked said friend **W** if he gave it away he said he did but I later found out that he (**W)** sold it to **M!** When I confronted **W** about it he blew me off and told me I was being ridiculous. AITA for no longer wanting to be friends with this guy.",

I was in a group with 3 guys. Let's call them Jack, Harry and Fred.\n\nFred was playing a newish deck that he hadn't played much, and was basically out of the box new. Harry was playing a dirty deck that would just control everyone else play, and Jack was playing a mid range deck (so not broken, but not weak either). I was playing my deck, that while not broken, can win combo style, and is protection/control (I like my stuff, dont destroy my stuff style deck). I'd worked hard on my deck, and I'm proud of it. \n\nHarry talks his game way too much. He encouraged Fred to win by hitting everyone, and Fred kills Harry and Jack. Out of spite, Harry destroys some of my stuff, knowing I cant retaliate, even though it didnt affect him. That's chill, I can get it back.\n\nAt this point Harry REALLY wants Fred to win. Hes saying stuff like \"this will be easy, just hit her and shes dead,\" and \"you can do this, you can win.\" I honestly would have just let Fred win at this point, but Harry was jumping around like a jumping bean, and getting on my nerves, offering to help Fred beat me (which is kinda a no no unless you're a new player). Fred was rejecting his help, and Harry's jumpyness was stressing both Jack and I out, and I think it was pissing Fred off too. Harry was also interjecting into things, commenting on Fred's every move, and trying to point out ways to beat me.\n\nThis is where I'm not sure if I'm the asshole. Cause I feel like one.\n\nFred goes to attack me, and I wipe his board. He looks defeated, since that was the way he was going to win. I didnt have to wipe it, I could have just let the damage through and lost. But Harry, the way he was jeering, it hit something inside of me, and I was tired of his bullying (in other games he targets me, because I have \"broken cards\"). \n\nI continue to stop Fred from winning until I myself win. Fred looked so sad and defeated and angry at himself. Harry was comforting him, saying that he did well, and that he would help him teach his deck. Fred refused, and I honestly felt like harry was being condescending. I left afterwards, because I felt like a monster. I apologised, and said he did do well, and that we learn from our defeats (hes beaten me before, and I learnt from those losses, which is why my deck has gotten a lot better). \n\nI feel so angry and sad. Am I the asshole for winning because someone else was taunting me and cheering on my opponent? He didnt deserve it. Harry just pushes my buttons, and I've been nothing but nice to him, but after tonight, I feel like a monster of the way I acted. ",

My other brother moved out, and my little brother was supposed to move in to my older brothers room. But because he\u2019s sick (and it\u2019s not contagious) he\u2019s still sharing a room with me.

Wakes up at 2pm and goes to bed at 4am\n\nNow on to my anger. For the last couple of weeks my little brother has been sick. And most of the time when he asks me to get him something, like an orange or some water, I\u2019ll get it for him, because treat others how you would want to be treated, right? So for the last few weeks, while I\u2019m home, 90% of the time I grab whatever he asks for and gives it to him.\n\nSo tonight, it\u2019s like 10:40pm and I just started trying to sleep. The bed was just how I liked it, blankets are warm, and I\u2019m starting to doze off. He wakes me up, to go throw something out. I grumble and ask why he can\u2019t do it, but still go and throw it out. Then get back into bed. Takes me til about 11:30 before I get comfortable enough to start dozing off again. Like a minute away from falling asleep. He wakes me up again to get him a bottle of water. I start getting a little angry, but get him the water. I quickly grab it and give it to him. And try to go back to bed. Now I\u2019m tossing and turning, trying to go back to sleep, while he watches some Netflix show. No headphones, nothing. Just watching the show. It\u2019s like 11:40 now. I ask him to put on headphones, cause I have to be up at 6am for to finish my homework for my ethics class. He starts complaining about it. Now in the past, he\u2019s just watched Netflix of YouTube without headphones this late, so I gave him like 3 pairs of headphones. 3 pairs, so I could sleep in peace. He starts complaining about having to wear headphones, and it takes me like 5 minutes to get him to wear a pair. I try going back to sleep. Now he\u2019s tossing and turning, and starts to complain because the headphones are uncomfortable, and tries to guilt trip me. It starts to work. This is the point where I get angry. I just yell at him for a minute. \n\nI feel very guilty about yelling at him, but I\u2019m writing this post at 12:21am, needing to get up at 6am to finish stuff for my college class.

            "input": "around six years ago, i went to a new school and had to make a whole new group of friends. eventually i found one that i got along with extremely well, and we became very close over time. our friendship stayed pretty strong for the next few years, but not without some minor anger every now and then. one of my friends (i'll call her B) didn't treat us too well. when it came to academics, B would slack off while the rest of us put the work in. she wouldn't pull her weight in group projects and she'd copy our homework last minute. socially, she was very arrogant and probably had a superiority complex? B acted like she was above the rest of us and didn't 'need' us, and wouldn't treat us very well (i.e school work problems) and this slowly got worse as time went by\n\ntwo years after we met, B got way worse. the usual stuff continued, like not putting effort into school and leeching off our work and marks, but her attitude got a lot worse. she started trying to replace us because we no longer shared the same interests and would scream and yell at us for being curious about her new interests. i also introduced her to one of my other friends who she instantly latched onto and became closer with him than i had been, and would constantly ignore me to talk to him instead. we once had a big project to do for a fair and we got together to work on it. \n\nshe took part in the 'fun' stuff that didn't take any real effort. when it came to the real work she did ONE part of it, probably the easiest, which ended up being garbage which i had to edit and fix. for the rest of the project she sat next to me texting my friend that i mentioned earlier while i did every single thing for our project. i repeatedly tried to get her to work and she would ignore me or brush me off and tell me she didn't know what to write and to figure it out myself. We ended up not doing very well because B prioritized texting over our marks. this also wasn't the first time she'd done something like that, as she'd worked with our other friends for similar projects before and done the exact same thing. as little work as possible so she could still get the marks for our work.\n\nwhen she got close with the friend from earlier (ill call him P) they got really toxic. the three of us had group chats together, but as they were closer with each other than they had been with me, i was a third wheel almost all the time. they took pleasure in berating me and making me feel bad about myself and would gang up on me and call me names, which in retrospect wasn't terrible, but considering i had issues with controlling my anger at the time and would be set off by very minor things, which they were very aware of, it wasn't nice to deal with. there's also nothing i hate more than being ganged up on because i can't defend myself when they're all making fun of me. they'd also leave me out of things (which i hate as well)\n\nB also had no concern for peoples feelings. when we had to make groups for things and she had to choose some friends over others, she wouldn't even ask if they were okay with her plans. she'd just do it anyways and tell them too bad. she also used to throw things at us when we were hanging out, and generally just treat us badly. literally everyone who knew her during this time period agreed she was not a good person at all. to sum it up, she was increasingly horrible to me and the rest of our friends over these two/three years, and by the end of them, when she got really bad, i decided i didn't want to put up with her anymore and couldn't wait until i went to a different school than her so i didn't have to be around her toxicity anymore. \n\nour friendship continued after this even though i was just faking it and powering through until i never had to see her again, until one day when she just started straight up ignoring me. it was out of nowhere. one day B was talking to me like old times and the next day she wouldn't answer me anywhere even though she was online. i was so confused and kept trying to talk to her but just got completely ghosted and eventually gave up and stopped chasing after her. a while later, a mutual friend who she still spoke to asked why she just cut me off like that, and B said that it was because ***I*** was the horribly rude one and she didn't want to deal with it anymore. this genuinely shocked me because the rudest i'd ever been to her was in self-defense when she was ganging up on me or looking down on us or ditching us for other people, and it was nothing more than joke comebacks like \"you suck/you're a loser\" which we had said to eachother many times before??\n\nB ended our friendship like that four years ago and i still hold a very strong grudge and haven't come close to getting over it. we haven't even spoken since then but every time i remember she exists or what she did to me or how she cut me off i actually get furious because i feel so wronged. there's so much wrong with it. she was the one who treated me so badly (and the rest of our friends as well) and then before i could make the move and end things she flipped it around on me and played the victim and said i was the big bully????\n\n i constantly seek validation from my other friends who knew her as it helps me to stop dwelling on it and everyone agrees she was horrible to me and i didn't do anything nearly as bad as she did. it also makes me angry because she wasn't brave enough to confront me herself and say what she had to say, which points even more at it being a big lie because she knew she was a bad person. i got no closure because i just heard her accusation second-hand, passed down from a friend. i'm a very confrontational person and it makes me so angry that she just got away with that without even having to speak to me and hear what i had to say. \n\nshe's genuinely afraid of me now and i know it's because she lied. she knows how she treated us but hides behind that lie to pretend she's a good person and she can't face me because she knows how badly she handled the situation. the last time we interacted in person i just acted like i didnt know her and she was shaking because she was so nervous.\n\nso yeah again to summarize, my friend B treated me very badly throughout our friendship and when i was finally done with it and planned to end things with her, she turned around and did it to me when she was much worse of a person than i ever felt i was. we weren't even going to the same school at that point so even if she confronted me herself we wouldve never seen eachother again anyways so it's stupid that she wouldn't talk to me directly. its been 4 years and im still so angry about what she did and i just want some kind of closure, and sometimes i just want to knock her out because she's too afraid to fess up and have a real confrontation with me about everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for still being so angry over it?? was i really the rude one and just didn't know it?? am i terrible for hating her so strongly for just cutting me off and being a wuss about it? most of the people i seek validation or help from are biased because they knew her so i would really like opinions on the whole situation from strangers.\n\n who was

I got a job working on a team of eight, including a girl that I'll call Laura. Laura is cute, not really my type, but we have a lot in common including an affinity for our hometown sports team. We spend a lot of time together going to happy hours with coworkers, playing board games, generally being friends- certainly nothing romantic. \n\nFast forward five months and we start chatting a bit more often, frequently about more and more intimate things. Because we work together, we still deny any feelings starting to develop. The next month, she finds out she's moving overseas. She quits her job, but before she quits, I do some pretty sizable farewell gestures, including planning a going away party. At this point, it's clear we definitely have feelings for one another and, because she's no longer part of our org, we start making out and eventually hook up a couple times. Because she's going overseas for a few years, we have a long discussion that I shouldn't wait for her and that if we start to date other people, it's ok.\n\nLaura moves overseas to a place where she knows absolutely no one. She helps me apply for her job, which I get. We text NONSTOP. We send each other dirty pics, talk often on the phone, tell each other we love one another. She meets a few local people but still doesn't have all that many people. Meanwhile I'm continuing to make friends in the city I live in, meet new people, generally continue on with my life.\n\nIn August, about five months from when she left, I met this girl (Nicole) that I fell absolutely head over heels for. Because I was interested in cultivating this new relationship, I started to spend more time with Nicole and less time talking to Laura. I don't want to upset Laura with the development of a new relationship, so I don't tell her about Nicole, especially if it doesn't work out. Laura seems to notice something's off, and asks me about it- I tell her everything is fine. We continue to chat, though at a lighter rate; I read her texts and don't respond right away like I used to. In my mind, it now feels like I'm in two relationships.\n\nI decide to tell Laura that I'm seeing Nicole to help explain why I'm being so distant. I text her (probably the bad move) and tell her that I'm seeing someone and want to talk to her about it. She says ok, we can talk on the phone after I'm out of work. After I get out of work, I give Laura a call. Laura is furious at me, saying I destroyed her trust, ruined our friendship, that I'm a pussy for not telling her about Nicole sooner. She says she no longer wants to talk to me until I think about the situation and apologize. I say ok and hang up.\n\nIn about a week, I send Laura a long email apologizing for hiding my relationship from her and being so distant. We talk for a while and she agrees to start talking to me again under one condition: If I start getting distant again, she's going to stop talking to me for good. I say ok and hang up.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we're still chatting a bit but this time I notice her getting a bit more distant. Short answers, curt responses, no longer continuing conversations. I figure she no longer wants to talk and stop talking. She doesn't resume conversation. That was the last time I talked to her- she's now blocked me on all social media, blocked my number, and told other friends of ours about the situation, essentially turning those friends against me. \n\nOn one hand, I understand why she's mad at me- I basically continued a relationship with her after she moved and didn't address the issue when something else came up. On the other hand, she chose to move away, understood I wouldn't wait to be in a relationship with her longterm, and didn't bring it up further when it seemed like I was pulling away. So the real question is- am I an asshole or is this just an unfortunate circumstance in which I lose a good friend of mine? Any advice would be great here.",

The 4 groomsmen and I have all been very close friends for the past 15-20 years. We have lived together, traveled together, completed weeklong backpacking trips, and more. Most of us live in the Western United States.\n\nAs we thought through various ideas, my best man and I talked about how an international trip would be fun. I went to Prague on the last bachelor party I attended (different group of friends) and it offered a great mix of a rich cultural and architectural history and happens to have the title of most beer consumption per capita. The trip was filled with walking tours, a beer bike tour, and just general exploration of the city (perhaps boring compared to a \u201ctypical\u201d bachelor party, but we all loved it). My best man and I thought through several different locations but ruled many out due to being too expensive, too risky/dangerous, or too far to travel. We zeroed in on Budapest as a potential location.\n\nMy best man floated the idea by the group, without me, to get their genuine feedback. The goal was to allow everyone a chance to say no if we had gotten carried away with the idea. I wanted to ensure that the trip would be one that everyone would want to go on and not feel like a burden or obligation. Based upon the feedback, he and I started talking potential dates that could work that would offer the lowest overall price. I offered to pay for some/all of an Airbnb to minimize the total cost since flights are pricey. \n\nA groomsman felt this was way too much time and money, but instead of raise the concern ended up posting it as a question to the editor on a popular blog. The editor responded calling me an asshole for trying to plan something that was beyond a 4-hour drive away and that European vacations should be reserved for, among other things, \u201ca tiny number of beloved friends.\u201d\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

Been dating my girlfriend (will be referred to as \u201cJen\u201d) for about four years, since my senior year of high school (she is two years older than me). \n\nShe has a brother (I\u2019ll call him \u201cBen\u201d) who has been in a pretty rocky relationship with his girlfriend (She\u2019ll be \u201cPip\u201d) for around two years. Ben is from my high school graduating class, I think she\u2019s a year younger. Ben and Pip\u2019s relationship has been difficult for a myriad of reasons I feel I\u2019m not informed on enough to give a complete account here, although I can say with certainty that they have broken up several times, both cheated at one point, both displayed some emotionally abusive behavior (she once claimed pregnancy to prevent him from leaving, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been a star boyfriend either). They\u2019ve been through one abortion (possibly more, don\u2019t know for sure) but about 11 months ago Pip got pregnant and they decided to keep it. They had the baby, and now live together.\n\nNow, to contrast, Jen and I\u2019s relationship is very strong, I can confidently say that marriage is very likely to be our future, and we\u2019ve discussed so in the past. \n\nEver since Jen learned of some of the emotionally abusive behavior Pip demonstrated, Jen loathes Pip. Jen refuses to be at many family gatherings and events if Pip is in attendance, and when she is, Jen will avoid her at all costs. Whenever she talks about Pip, it is with some pretty vile language. She has a darker personality/vocabulary/whatever so it\u2019s not uncommon for her to verbally wish she\u2019d die in a car crash, for example, or saying she\u2019d like to slit her throat. \n\nRecently, Pip has made some very questionable statements/actions that cause great concern in Jen for her new nephew. For example, Pip has announced she is skeptical of the benefits of vaccines, and may not vaccinate the kid. Also, she has a particular distaste for the \u201cLGBT Agenda\u201d in that she opposes the existence of a gender spectrum or non-heterosexual behavior being taught in schools, and has expressed a desire that her kid be \u201cStraight, or nothing.\u201d Jen identifies as a member of the LGBT community and thus LGBT issues are very important to her.\n\nFinally, the reason for my post. When Jen brings up the stuff she dislikes about Pip, I agree with almost everything she says, and share her passion and concern for the child. But I also urge her not to use such violent and descriptive language when talking about her. This happens often, and usually ends in her being furious with me because she feels she isn\u2019t being heard by her family at large, so when I bring this up she gets a similar feeling. \n\nI don\u2019t want her to use that language for two reasons: one, so that it doesn\u2019t affect her mental health, constantly wishing death and violence on someone she knows in person. Two, if there is ever a custody battle over the child, I don\u2019t want her comments (some in text message form) being used to make the case the child is not safe with her side of the family. (Her fam has some shady stuff in their past that could contribute to that case) \n\nAm I The Asshole?",

            "input": "So to start this I'm going to explain that I'm 23 now but I went to school in a small village in the UK which had an infant, juniors and high school meaning I only went to school with people from my village up until high school when kids from other villages travelled to our school. There was a guy who lived in my village who worked as like a school director and I was actually in the same class as his daughter throughout infants school I think it age like 7 to 10 but I'm pretty stoned and I actually went on a week long school trip with this guy during the last year of being at that school.  Any way I went to school with her all the way through my school career, she went college as far as I'm aware but I'm honestly not sure as she was always quite popular (she actually stamped her foot on my arm in year 4 for no reason once) and I hung out with either the group of nerds, the group of stoners or the 'moshers emos and goths.' I chose to go to a different college to the majority of people in my high school and village to escape all the cliques and bullshit which was the best choice I ever made as I now live in a different city with loads of friends across two cities and I'm following/living my dream career wise.\n\nAnyway, this guy was on the board of the directors for multiple schools (all small children schools) in a small city called Wakefield where the village I lived called home. His name was Chris Powell if you want to Google him he's now in jail. Chris was caught by a 'nonce hunters' style Facebook vigilante group that I think go by the name Predator Exposure (check out their Facebook, they recorded their own song.)\n\nWhen Chris was caught he'd gone to meet what he thought was a young boy and his car boot was full of sex toys so it was quite clear that he was down to fuck. Sadly for Chris it wasn't a young boy it was  a group of rough looking Yorkshire blokes and women  wearing their own brand of pedo hunting merchandise waving Facebook live streaming phones in his face. I don't fully remember as it's a few years back and once again I'm pretty stoned but I think from then it was a classic case of having loads of child porn on his laptop/phone and he'd been contacting and grooming actual kids as well as the fake one created by the hunters.\n\nFast forward to today, one of the only two people I'd call a good friend from school and the only one who had been there throughout every school sent me a print screen of a video on YouTube. The YouTube video is titled 'Top 10 Greatest Nonce Stings' and has 295,444 views at this moment in time. The print screen itself is timed on a still image of the nonce that has managed to make number 9 on this list looking gormless as fuck. Next to the photo of the nonce there is a fat black slab and in big red writing is the nonces name and that name is none other than our good friend CHRIS POWELL.\n\nSo I've been feeling pretty low lately and this kind of really made me laugh because of the name of the video and the fact that my mate sent it to me just made me chuckle. Anyway I was going to post it on Instagram but then thought to myself that I don't have anyone really from school on Instagram whilst on Facebook I have a few old bullies who tried to reconnect and a few people who I just never deleted and never deleted me. I knew I didn't have Chris' daughter on there but may have a couple of her friends possibly on there so thought it'd be much more relevant and cause a bit of a discussion there as I'm bored and stuck at home alone a lot at the moment (hence the daft long Reddit post.)\n\nSo I posted the print screen with the caption 'when someone you went on a school trip with becomes YouTube famous \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29' (not an emoji guy just sarcastic as fuck) and it got a 7 or 8 likes which basically means it banged compared to my usual posts and yeah I was pretty happy with myself and started smoking up and getting my chill on. Next thing you know this guy from school who bullied me before going to Afghanistan and coming back on some fake kindness/overly nice trip comments calling me out saying I shouldn't post it in case Chris' daughter saw, I tried to explain how I didn't have her on Facebook and he continued on about how I might not have her added but her or her family could see. I explained how my posts are set private to my friends but he continued on at me saying I was disrespectful to her and her family. At this point some one randomly chimed in and called him a nonce sympathiser so I get a bit hyped and go in on him about the previous points a little harder and the fact that his name and face should be shared around so people remember him when he's released all whilst repeatedly calling him a 'noble nonce sympathiser.' he other people chimed in and ripped on him and he defended his view by saying 'what if your dad was a pedo would you want people sharing things about him' to which I replied 'if my dad was a pedo and people were sharing things about him it wouldn't matter to me as he'd be dead to me and not my father.' He then started back footing and making out like he didn't mean any of what he said or want an arguement then out of nowhere accused someone of being up my arse before rounding it off by wishing my business well.\n\nTL;DR - nonce was school director, went to school with his daughter, nonce got caught by pedo hunters, I shared print screen later and got called out for being an asshole.\n\nSo yeah, I wanna know if he's right or if I did nothing wrong, I haven't written anything that long since o was at school with Chris' daughter!\n\nThanks Reddit!",

She's the most important person in my life, as she has helped me heal from my mental illness, get me off drugs and graduate and get a job. She has done a lot for me, although at times I feel she can be bit manipulative. After we broke up I went back to her for support as my life started to spiral out of control.\n\nLately I have been not wanting to sleep at my ex's place, I've felt I need my own space and I'm trying to date and meet other people.  She texted me in the afternoon she wanted my help with something and said she wished I would come over. I didn't reply. Then she calls me and asks, I don't want to tell where I am and I answer I'm not sure if I want to come over. I'm working late and going to the gym, and she tries to call me again. I feel like I need my own space so instead of answering the call I'll reply that I would drop over to help. I felt like I didn't want to stay the night, although I didn't say this. So I'm going to the gym and waiting the bus, this takes a couple of hours and at this point it is around 18:00. She texts me if I need a lift. I don't reply, as I'm already on my way to the bus stop. Then she calls, and I tell that I'm coming.\n\nWhen I arrive I start to feel bad, I feel like I want to go home, so I'm thinking of helping her and taking a bus home. When I come in she's sitting there and telling me she wants my help with setting up a camera. I get frustrated because I feel she could have done this by herself, and I tell her this. She then says that we can do it together. She offers me food, I decline. We take care of the camera thing and I start to contemplate on leaving. She comes to me and says:\n\n\"Do you want me to take you home so that you don't feel obligated to be here and stay over?\n\nI took a shower though and I would really not like to get ill as the weekend is coming\"\n\nAs she's offering me this, I'm feeling anxious and want to go home:\n\n\"I'd like you to take me home, please\"\n\nThen she gets really upset and mad, and we walk to her car.

Fortunately, this neighbor recently put her house for rent and we have new neighbors with whom I'm respectful and try to avoid any problem similar to those that I had with the house owner.\n\nAnd here's the problem: we got to my house after buying food and I asked my friend to park her car in a different place than where she intended. I asked her twice, very politely and mentioning the problems I had in the past with the bitch neighbor I mentioned earlier, to park her car in front of my house so I could avoid any possible situation with the tenants. Well, she said she would ask another neighbor (one that had nothing to do with the parking space). I asked her for a third time to not do it and park in front of my house. She minimized my request and parked not only in the tenants' parking space, but also invading the space of a third neighbor.\n\nI kept silent while she walked to my house and before entering my home I asked her politely to move her car. She said she had asked the third neighbor about using that parking space and the neighbor said that he'd call me if they were using the space or needed her to move the car. I asked her if she was not moving her car and she said: NO. That was my fifth attempt and I was about to explode, so I decided to do the opposite, I kept completely silent.\n\nWe sat down and ate but I kept the conversation to an absolute minimum. Only thanked and asked for food and that was it.

She answered that she also dislikes some of her attitudes toward her friend and her. I asked her to try to keep things separate and don't let my own struggles contaminate her relations and friendships.\n\nNow, I'm at my home, wondering if this issue of someone disrespecting my house rules is too much and I was the asshole in this situation.

I thought it was pretty dumb, so I ignored it at first, but she egged me on to take it. Well, it wasn't that long, so I took the online test. She wanted to know my results, so I showed them to her.

It started with me essentially doing the usual I would wait for them to come home from school feed them and let them do whatever. (keeping them from trying to kill each other) at som point we were outside in the back yard she had applied gotten a lot of cards from someone at her school, about 20 or so Yu-Gi-Oh cards.\n\n She was showing them off to her brothers simply enough I didn't mind or care about it that much until she pulled out a lighter and started burning the damn things. If anyone here collects card like I did I'm sure you may have the same pain I did. I asked Kathy. \n\nMe:\"Kathy! What are you doing? Didn't you say[guys name I can't remember] gave them to you?\" \n\nKathy:\"yah\" *is picking up another and is  burning the corners*\n\nMe:\"then why are you burning it?\"\n\nKathy: \"it's mine I can do what I want with it\" \n\nI don't stop her after that, she burns the corners of some and burning a couple completely.

A few days later she was in the kitchen table and had the Yu-Gi-Oh cards and some other random playing cards out playing out again to put it simple she was flinging them around the kitchen playing some game, I asked her to clean up her stuff so I could sweep and mop. She hardly torches a thing and runs off. *Sigh*\n\nAnyways I cleaned up the kitchen and have all the cards that were all over the kitchen in a stack on the table. Im frustrated with the lack of care with Kathy not giving a crap about something that was given to her. I'm ashamed to say I pocketed them. It's as simple as that. In my head at the time she didn't deserve them she wanted to destroy and ruin something that was a \"gift\"(started thinking maybe she stole them) What i think was the saddest part is that she never asked about them after...like at all. I expected her to ask if anyone had seen them but no, nothing it was as if they never existed after I took them. Am I the asshole?\n",

            "input": "Starting this with an explanation of the situation.\n\nI was previously employed as a desk jockey in a company where the department was roughly twenty people of particular demographics and I was the sole member of a polar opposite demographic. I had worked there for about two years with half of my duties being transferred from another person who worked there with one foot out the door and a job title one significant step ahead of my own. I also had taken an extraordinarily nasty account which required at least intermediate familiarity in an uncommon dialect of a foreign language to cover correctly. I had basic familiarity which was more than the rest of the department combined.\n\nMy performance was considered somewhere between \"good\" and \"great\" through the first year, somewhat notable as I was being judged on a scale used for 5-10 year veterans. I wasn't some infallible rock star at the job, but I was definitely good enough to keep around and the only person to handle the bilingual account properly in years.\n\nOne person who had previously been employed at this company had come by to visit with a few people as she had recently left work at another company in town. She was interested in getting her previous position back, or at least something close to it. Her previous position was on par with the person whose duties I had taken over. My direct manager told her that nothing was available at the moment and she had already trimmed a few positions in the past few years.\n\nAs you can imagine, this led to a \"That's a nice job you have there, I think my friend will take it\" situation. I was assigned a new account, the previous owner refused to assist, I inevitably make an error treating the account similarly to my others, and I was let go on thin pretenses. While nothing was actually said, it seemed rather clear to me that I was the one to go as I did not fit the department demographic while the previous employee did. I had an easy time claiming unemployment, but I didn't have the documentation for any sort of legal action. In the end I just wanted to be done with it.\n\nThe AITA part is that I proceeded to anonymously report my former manager to corporate HQ for drug abuse. The company was excessively harsh on any potential drug use. I happened to overhear the day before my termination that my manager had obtained a few prescription pain pills from a friend after spraining her ankle rather than take half a day off for a doctor's visit, thanks to the fact that said manager had two voices, loud and super loud. I don't particularly care about that kind of thing and saw the company drug policy as being absolutely Draconian, but I also wanted revenge. She thought she was safe as we had been through our \"random\" drug testing only a few weeks prior. Due to violating drug policy, she was terminated immediately with cause.\n\nThere are also a few complicating factors.\n\nAccording to her social media, previous manager had swiftly risen in the ranks in another company before a sudden \"departure\" and taken a new job at the previously mentioned corporation at a much lower position at what was likely a quarter of previous pay, although she had risen to something not far from her first position by the time I worked for her. After she had joined the second company, she had a child who happened to be special needs and very expensive to care for, pushing her to become a bit of a workaholic.\n\nPrevious manager also made a few vague, plausibly deniable comments to me regarding some physical attributes of mine being desirable. I acted oblivious and nothing came of it, although she did continue the comments on occasion.\n\nTL;DR version- Former manager terminated my job to give it to a former co-worker/friend of hers, I got her fired for her minor transgressions, this may have seriously screwed up her life and family life, but she also was a creep. Was I in the wrong?",

He has a clean record so I feel kind of bad that a charge like this could essentially ruin his life, but I let him get away with alot of shit and hes really screwed me over.

Since he got that new job he has obviously been on a more regular sleep schedule.   \nSo last night I'm sitting in my room getting stoned and doing some computer work and I hear knocking on the door.  after the 2nd knock and $jason doesn't get it (I'm not expecting anyone), I open the door and it's his friend. He's looking for $jason. I tell him I have no idea if he's home (or sleeping), I haven't seen him today. He knocks on his door and I kind of go back to doing my own thing and then he leaves. Some time later this guy knocks on the door again and I let him in. He inquiries about him, I tell him I still have not heard anything,  knocks on his door and then leaves.\n\nSometime later I hear $jason come out of his room, I open my door and tell him that his friend came by. He was  very pissed and says yeh thanks for waking me up. He asks why would I let someone in at 12:30am?  \nI shoot back that I'm not gonna get mixed into his business and it's up to him to tell his friends not to come by after midnight (or whatever time).  \n\n\nMy feelings are that I don't know if he's expecting a friend, or would be happy to see someone or wouldn't. I don't want to care about that. If someone knocks on my door I will answer it, and if its someone that I recognize and have seen here before with $jason, I don't see a reason to not let him in. I was also totally oblivious to the time when this happened (as I said, I was high).  \nNow all of this is obviously unless he specifically tells me, never let in anyone after whatever time. I can respect that.",

            "input": "Disclaimer: This post is a copy  from r/Rant I posted a few minutes agoand therefore it\u2019s structured as a rant...nonetheless, it\u2019s accurate and hopefully not too biased. It was also edited a little, but I thought I should ask if i\u2019m being the bad kid here. \n\nStart of post:\n\nI don\u2019t know why my mom has such a huge issue with just respecting my boundaries. A group of strangers are going to come soon, and I\u2019d prefer to not be a significant part of it. However, my mom has a different idea. \n\nShe thinks it\u2019s acceptable to let strangers into my room, while i\u2019m doing something else, just to go to my bathroom. Why? Because It\u2019s the shorter path. God forbid our guests have to walk an extra five meters to go to the living room bathroom on the other direction. She knows I don\u2019t ever want people in my room who I do not know. I\u2019m uncomfortable with it, I always was. We have a grand fucking living room and a massive guest room that are practically attached as one massive room, and multiple bathrooms. WHY do you need to go into my room?!\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why i\u2019m so defensive of my room, no it\u2019s not dirty and messy. There are plushies there, tons of them, and my PC setup is decorated to the brim with plushies and stickers and all over it. I don\u2019t really want strangers going in here, it just makes me uncomfortable. Even my family seeing this makes me uncomfortable as they\u2019re kind of judgemental about it. Additionally, I always lock my door. I absolutely cannot handle the idea that someone might enter my room at any moment, even if it\u2019s a family member. This is why I told literally everyone multiple times to knock the door before entering my room, just give me 3 seconds brace, it\u2019s all I need. But that never happens. I always get a mini heart attack hearing my door handle suddenly and loudly opening, only for the person on the other side to be stopped due to the door being locked. I then ask who it is and i\u2019m usually met by silence. I go and open the door and we go from there. WHY, no really WHY can\u2019t you knock?! All I need is a little \u201c *knock knock*... OP? You in there? Need ya for something \u201c, but instead you choose to barge in, as in all of my family. The only person here who doesn\u2019t do that is my maid and my littlest sister. \n\n\nThis is why entering my room is something I do not want happening. I\u2019m that kind of person, mom should know, I was like this my entire life but she tells me it\u2019s \u201cWeird\u201d and \u201cBad behavior\u201d . Excuse me?! I\u2019m not the one randomly inviting guests without warning their children, then fucking just letting them loose in their child\u2019s room all of the sudden. SHE ACTUALLY DID THIS IN THE PAST, I FORGOT TO LOCK THE DOOR THAT DAY.  I WAS JUST RELAXING, THEN DOOR SUDDENLY OPENS, STRANGERS.PNG . There were other lesser incidents where she kept knocking and saying \u201cCome on OP! Come out now and say hi to the guests!\u201d Even though I explicitly, multiple times, told her not to do that. I didn\u2019t unlock the door. I just sat there in silence because I had literally no idea how to respond.\n\n\nNow, I was willing to go out of my room at some point to say hi and talk a bit to the guests, but mom instead insists on me wearing our traditional clothes (Kandoorah) and for me to just sit there in silence. She actually told me \u201cYeah you don\u2019t have to say anything, I just want you to sit there the entire time.\u201d \nI\u2019m not doing that. \n\nI wore some nicer clothes and went out to my mom. I warned her:\n\n \u201cHey, if you try to force me out of my room i\u2019ll probably just ignore you, so it\u2019ll just be embarrassing yourself. I\u2019ll probably come out at some point and say hi.\u201d\n\nMom: Why aren\u2019t you wearing your kandoorah?\n\n\u201c?...Did you hear what I just said?\u201d\n\nMom: I don\u2019t want to hear what you said.\n\n\u201cThe information did go through though, right?\u201d\n\nNo response as she goes into the bathroom.\nIt\u2019s arguably rude to be talking to your mom like this, but i\u2019m just so familiar with the situation. She\u2019s gonna do something that she knows I don\u2019t want her to do. I\u2019m just trying to make it firm this time. So, i\u2019ve decided. I just locked my room, and took some gadgets with me and i\u2019m heading to camp in our outdoor shack (which is actually really cozy, I used it as a room for a while in the past). I\u2019m good here, I have my switch, a few anime episodes downloaded, my phone, it\u2019ll last me a few hours. If my mom tries to knock on the door for a while, i\u2019m just not going to be there. I may or may not go inside later and say hi to the guests and talk for a bit. If mom asks me why I locked my room and left it, it\u2019ll confirm that she tried to enter or get me out even though i\u2019ve told her not to ever do that since the dawn of time. I\u2019d respond with \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going to be in my room didn\u2019t I? Before the guests came? Told you there isn\u2019t gonna be a response, i\u2019m not in there.\u201d.\n\nEven though I do sound a bit anxious socially in here, i\u2019m really not. I just have what I think are perfectly reasonable boundaries, and I need to be ready for interaction. I\u2019ll be able to have comebacks if my mom keeps questioning me further, without making it too awkward.\n\nRant over, thanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\n",

To understand the story you need to know that I'm female and half korean and half german.\n\nA friend and I went to a nightclub one weekend. When we went outside to get some fresh air I noticed a group of five people about 10 meters away looking in our direction and very blatantly talking about us. This did not stop for about five minutes and I was uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore this. I just wanted to have fun and did not want to have any kind of confrontation with anybody. I could have walked away, this is true. I didn't because while it was awkward, I didn't want to give up my sitting space.\n\nAfter 5 minutes one guy from this group stood up and walked towards us. Then he said \"hey, sorry for bothering you. But me and my friends have been talking about you for the past minutes trying to find out where you're from. Like, you don't look german. So, where are you from?\" and I replied \"Frankly, it made me umcomfortable that you spent the last five minutes talking about me and looking at me. I'm not a zoo animal.\" \n\nHe was taken aback and clearly hurt.  Without a word he walked back to his friends. Maybe I'm the asshole, but I didn't enjoy getting \"examined\" by them.

We also dont know anyone with a tow or truck (meaning that we would have to rent them out). At that point I decided that it would not be worth spending all that money, and that it would be better to wait. When I told my friend, he got very upset. Granted, we have been talking about purchasing this car for about a few weeks. We got into a pretty heated argument. It got to a point where he began to criticize my as a person, stating how I \"dont take risks in life\" and that because of that I \"wont go far\". I told him the reasoning of financial issues the car would bring, and that it isnt worth it, but he  immediately shut me down every time I said that. It got me pretty upset, so I mentioned how his parents would always give him extra cash whenever he wanted/needed it (Because he is from a well-off family). It got him even more upset.\n\nSo, I left his place, telling him that if he wanted to buy it, he could, with his own money, and that I wont get involved in it.\n\nAITA?

We'll call my partner 'Sarah'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm confused as to how I should feel about this. We had a rocky relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got to the point where we said we were going to take a break from each other. I asked her is she going to see someone else and she said she's going to live her life. To me, that basically means yes, she's going to see someone else if someone else comes along. I told her that I feel uncomfortable with that. I told her that's not a break; to me, a break is just some space apart to cool off but we're still together, and what she's describing was a breakup. So in the end, we broke up. I moved out and went back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets confusing to me. We broke up but we were still in each other's lives all the time. At some point, I started staying over again and during this time, we started being intimate again; we would do things like hold hands, hug each other, snuggle and even kiss each other. One night, one thing led to another, we slept together. The next day, we went to a nice restaurant for lunch and I apologised for the stuff I did in the past (mostly me being emotionally detached and not understanding emotions, this is a classic avoidant person dating an anxious person situation). I started crying at this point, then Sarah came over to me to comfort me and kissed me on the cheek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all that, it feels like we got back together. Then Sarah tells me she met someone on Tinder and she has a crush on them, but she's deleted the app because she wants to think about it before she does anything. But she said she's added them on facebook and has their number. I remember feeling horrible by this news. I told her that I dont feel comfortable with her seeing someone else romantically. She said she just wants to be friends with this person now. I just remember feeling horribly upset by this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSarah saw how upset I was, she comforted me and told me it's going to be okay. She said things will get better and she believes in me that I can get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very next day, I went back to work. During the day, I noticed that Sarah accidentally left her medicine in my bag so I texted her to tell her medicine is with me. I asked if she would like me to bring it back tonight and have dinner together. I got no response from her so I thought she's probably busy doing something (she usually doesn't reply to our messages) and I'll just bring it back to her place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hopped on the train and called again later and she picked up. I told her i'm on the way to her place because she left her medicine with me. Sarah tells me that she's actually in the city and is on the way back home. Wanting to make conversation and genuinely interested in her life, I asked her what did she do in the city. She said she was hanging out with a friend and because they were watching a movie, her phone was on silent. They went to the arcade too. She was on her way back so I waited for her at the train station for over an hour. Stupid me thought it was a good idea to not wear warm clothes and I froze my ass off. I killed time by knitting her a scarf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Sarah arrived she looked really sick! So I took care of her that night. While we were walking to get some takeaway, I asked how her day was and she said it was good. When I asked with which friend, she dodged the question which made me feel uneasy because before she told me she found someone on tinder which she has some feelings for. This makes me uneasy because i\u2019m not stupid, I get a feeling she was with that tinder girl since she didn\u2019t tell me who she was with\u2026 I've put it out of my mind for the rest of the night because she was sick and took care of her. Later that night, she told me I was special to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up still feeling uneasy and scared. I was freaking out that she went on a date with that tinder girl last night. My gut tells me she did go on a date with that tinder girl. I needed to get the hell outta there. She woke up while I was getting ready. She had a look on her face and tilted her head toward me and smiled, so I kissed her on the lips goodbye and she smiled back at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left that morning and went back to work and went home. The next few days I was just feeling completely crushed and awful. I tried calling her but she ignored it. She finally messages me back after a few days and asks why I was \u201chassling her\u201d. I told her I\u2019ve been feeling very low. She then says she needs to work on herself and appreciated it that I was supportive and was there for her as a friend. She know\u2019s we\u2019re complicated but it\u2019s a lot of stress on her. That completely threw me off! As a friend! I just felt so crushed and I broke down and cried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later, she texts \u201chow are we sorting out the dentist payment?\u201d. Backstory here is that she needs wisdom teeth surgery. When we were dating, I said I\u2019ll pay for it. She\u2019s unemployed and I\u2019m working full time. I didn\u2019t answer right away because I was still feeling awful and spiralling. Sarah later calls me and asks me \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong\u201d in a very impatient tone. I told her how I was feeling and she says \u201cwell you've put me through stuff too, the bad outweigh the good\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her did she go out with that tinder girl, she said yes. I asked was it a date, she said she didn\u2019t know. After a lot of back and forth, we concluded that we were just friends after all that time and that I\u2019ll be paying for the surgery (SO DUMB OF ME!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think after a few days I went back her place. Eventually we started arguing. I got so fed up I told her we can\u2019t keep doing this. I said I\u2019ll get out of her life and maybe one day we can be friends again. Sarah was sad after I said that and I was sad too, we both ended up crying. I wiped away her tears and hugged her and comforted her. Eventually she kinda tackled me to the floor and hugged me and cried on me. I held her in my arms and rubbed her back to comfort her. She eventually kissed me on the lips. I was surprised but I kissed her back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said she missed me. I asked about that tinder girl and she says she doesn\u2019t feelings for her anymore. Sarah said while she was with tinder girl, she wished she was with me instead. She said she wasn\u2019t going to talk to her anymore. Eventually, Sarah did delete her number and facebook. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch later, probably a few weeks after, I brought up how upset I was when I knew for sure that she went on a date with that tinder girl even though I told her I was uncomfortable with Sarah seeing someone else while we were on \u201cbreak\u201d. Sarah then says it\u2019s my fault that she turned to tinder because I was such a jerk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, she confessed to me that she also kissed a guy on the lips the night before just to see what it was like. I was so shocked that I dropped my phone while I was holding it. I thought to myself, so I WASN\u2019T GOING CRAZY AND UNREASONABLY JEALOUS of her guy friend (I kept my jealous feelings to myself because I didn\u2019t want to push her away). After she told me and saw that I wasn\u2019t taking it well, she asked am I still going to pay for the wisdom teeth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAND GUESS WHAT MY STUPID ASS SAID? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went off on a tangent on that last bit, but back to the main point. Am I the asshole for feeling so shitty about that whole situation?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also I need help in getting over her)",

He also has an 11 year old son with his ex gf from high school. \n\nWhile we were dating, It was always difficult for me to accept that he had a son with another woman because it made me feel really insecure. They were on bad terms for some time but I asked him to call her so he can see his son and try to connect with him. Even thou he and his ex are not together he has gone to her house to visit them every Sunday for a few hours. Although I felt very insecure about it, I was the one to encourage him to go see him. I grew up with out a dad so I didn\u2019t think it would be fair that I let my jealousy get the best of me try to keep a child from having a dad.  \n\nOnce we got married, I made a promise to myself and decided to get over my irrational insecurities and try to become friends with his ex. It was a slow process on my part because I felt very uncomfortable going to visit them, I felt like a complete out cast and I felt very stupid. She was actually very friendly and we became somewhat friends. We don\u2019t call each other every weekend or hang out often, but when I do I go over her house I feel very comfortable hanging out and drinking and dancing. We really do have a good time with her best friend and her siblings and I also truly enjoy hanging out with his son. \n\nHe took that comfort and friendship away from me, she is very close to her siblings and best friend so I know she discussed these texts with them. I no longer feel like I can look at any of them in the face. I\u2019m just so hurt.\n\nHe made my biggest insecurities come true. This wasn\u2019t a random girl from the internet. This is a woman that he has a child with and that I was very jealous about for years. We built a friendship but it took years of hard work to feel like I could let my guard down. She didn\u2019t respond to his texts and did not lead him on, I really do appreciate her and respect her as a woman. But I just can\u2019t look at her or go to her house. She isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s my husband I know but it\u2019s still very hard. \n\nSince we got married and I became friends with his ex, I always felt very safe and secure with my relationship. We absolutely love our daughter and we get along so well. I have been faithful and so has he, so we have never had a reason to not trust each other so I\u2019m completely shocked by this. I just don\u2019t feel safe anymore, I feel alone. He was the one person I could call and count on. I feel like he robbed me of a friend, which is him. It probably sounds stupid but I feel like he isn\u2019t my friend anymore. \n\nHis excuse is that he is an idiot, but that it wasn\u2019t a big deal since nothing happened. When I confronted him he tried to say it wasn\u2019t him and denied it. Nothing happened because his ex respected me enough as a friend and woman to not cross the line, or betray me behind my back. He didn\u2019t even apologize until the third day and that\u2019s only because I told him he hasn\u2019t even sorry.   I just feel as if he is so selfish. \n\nI feel like he doesn\u2019t understand what he he took from me, how much my relationship with her meant. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting him to leave our apartment? I have also been looking in to divorce but don\u2019t know if I am overreacting. \n\nHe didn\u2019t physically cheat on me, but I can\u2019t help feeling emotionally disturbed. I have been crying since I found out. He doesn\u2019t want me, he doesn\u2019t respect me. He wants to have sex with other people. He is asking other people for nudes. I feel like he has taken advantage of me. I work a full time job, I take care of our daughter and her needs 95% of the time. I do his laundry and always have food made for him to eat. I try so hard to make his life easier. I do all the cleaning, I handle paying all the bills.  I feel so dumb for trying so hard. \n\nI\u2019m so confused, like how long has he been doing this behind my back? I have never snooped his phones or checked his call or anything , I have completely trusted his word and give him his space. I am feeling very stupid right now. \n\nI just feel like I lost respect for him, we are very open with each other and have agreed to tell one another if we ever loose interest or are attracted to someone else because we should at least have that respect for one another and not cheat. But he didn\u2019t tell me. I happened to open our laptop and the messages started coming in and the text was displayed so I read his texts asking for sex and nudes. If I hadn\u2019t opened the lap top I would have never known, and he would have never told me.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking for a divorce and asking him to move out?\n\nPlease shed some light on the situation because I can\u2019t.

I used to live in the countryside where there was a lot of space for sports and other activities for my friends and I. However, recently I moved to a dense city where there is no space for any of the sports I used to do. On top of this the people in my school smoke and go clubbing which I find uninteresting. All of this has caused me to be quiet and quite depressed. I am a lot more insecure now and can hardly speak to people without panicking. \n\nNow on to the actually story. I did actually find one sport in this city and that was rowing. It seemed that I progressed quite well in rowing and my teacher was very ambitious with me. I don\u2019t  really want to any competitions just yet because I am still very new and have only been in a group boat two times. However a week ago my coach told me that I was going to go to a completion this Sunday. This made me panic but I didn\u2019t know how to tell him that I didn\u2019t feel ready or capable of doing a competition, so I just told him \u2018yes\u2019. For the rest of the week I was panicking for the competition and kept telling my mom that I wasn\u2019t ready and didn\u2019t want to do it, but she kept telling me \u2018No you have to do this\u2019. She telling me this got me to feel that I couldn\u2019t let her down and that I had to do this for her. One day I finally managed to tell the coach that I don\u2019t feel ready but his only response was \u2018No you\u2019re ready\u2019 and I didn\u2019t feel like I could talk back to him so I just replied \u2018Ok\u2019.\n\nThen, the day before the competition I have one training session with the people who I\u2019m supposed to row with in the competition. Keep in my this is my seconded time in a multi crew row boat so my technique was far from perfect. I heard the others in my row boat speak in French which I could speak slightly so I could just make out what they were saying. I heard how they were making fun of how I rowed and how they wanted me off the boat and they made fun of my accent (my accent is slightly Scandinavian) and just in general made fun of me. I also felt that I wasn\u2019t rowing so well and couldn\u2019t keep up with them. This really put me off the competition and I absolutely did not want be in this competition. I came home and began telling my parents how my rowing team doesn\u2019t like me and that I absolutely do not want to do that competition. However they told me that I got myself into this situation and that I had to fix it. I didn\u2019t feel like I could tell my coach \u2018no\u2019 just because he has so much expectations for me and I just didn\u2019t feel secure enough to call him. In the end we gotten in to an argument and to make a long story short, I kind of wanted them to help me send a text or call my coach and tell him I can\u2019t come, they said no, I got mad and locked myself in my room which brings us to now. \n\n\nI really just wanted to let off some steam to know if I\u2019m wrong for getting angry\n\nSorry if my English is wrong\n",

She has gone through a  lot of very traumatic shit, including an abusive household with parents  who on the regular manipulate her. I don't want to go into details on  all of that, but I do want to acknowledge that she comes from a pretty  toxic background.\n\nThird, TL;DR (put at the front, as per a recent LPT I saw):\n\n\\- I have a friend with anxiety issues that probably qualify as mental illness\n\n\\-  I have done a lot for this friend. Like, a lot. But the most relevant  are loaning her $2,000 and giving her a ride to work everyday and a  couch to sleep on nearly every night for two and a half months.\n\n\\-  I told what I thought was a funny anecdote about her at a company  get-together (she and I both work for the same company), which caused  her to become upset with me and accuse me of being a shitty friend.\n\n\\- I blew up on her.\n\n\\-  Recently learned that she told a mutual friend she was afraid of me,  but it looks to me like that she's using me as a scapegoat to avoid  responsibility for a financial obligation.\n\n\\-  Am I the asshole for blowing up? Am I being too hard on her?  Insensitive to her emotional needs? Or is she being an asshole for using  me? Throwing me under the bus to cover for her personal and  professional failures?\n\n\\- It's a VERY long read. It's a doozy. With months of things boiling up to a point.\n\nFourth, the story:\n\nMe  and this friend met way back in college, and while we are not and never  have been romantically involved we spent enough time around each other  that multiple rumors popped up that we were secretly cheating on our  respective S/Os. Generally, these rumors never bothered me because,  honestly, in college I was definitely the kind of asshole who didn't  give a shit what anyone else thought about anything if it didn't effect  me in an immediate and direct way. Looking back on it, I cringe. But  hey. That's who I was, and I try my best to own that part of my life-- I  don't make excuses for myself and I try hard to acknowledge when I'm in  the wrong. So part of me posting here is, I guess, checking to see if  I'm still that asshole.\n\nAfter college,  me and $Friend kept in touch. My S/O and I broke up for unrelated  reasons, and I ended up leaving the country for a bit after graduation. I  was pretty heartbroken and lonely, and yeah, I know leaving a country  due to a breakup is overly dramatic. So sue me. While overseas, I got to  missing a lot of my old friends from college, so I saved up my money  and flew $Friend to where I was along with her S/O.\n\nI  came back to the U.S. a little over a year later, and shortly after  that $Friend and her S/O broke up. I didn't get involved-- I was close  to both of them, and didn't want to be put in the awkward situation of  choosing sides.\n\nYears go by, and we're  thick as thieves. End up going overseas together again-- she lost her  passport, and the night before the flight I helped her find it by  tearing her apartment apart. It's a fun anecdote.\n\nShe  ends up getting with a new $S/O, who I've since become very close to as  well. Cool dude. Laid back, easy going kind of guy. I briefly ended up  with a new S/O, the Bad Ex who ended up cheating on me and spreading a  lot of false rumors about me. Luck of the draw, I guess. Now, maybe it's  because the whole time I was overseas no one I used to be super close  to ever reached out to me or even knew I had left the country, and that  HURT. So when my ex started spreading shit about me, that REALLY got  under my skin--- I had felt like I had finally built some real  friendships, only to find that people I'd known for years were willing  to ditch me in a heartbeat. Of those, I ended up getting an apology from  one of them-- he later found out through someone else that my Bad Ex  was lying, and sent me a message on social media apologizing for not  believing me. I don't know if he was the only one who ever found out,  the only one who ever ended up believing me, or the only one who was big  enough to admit he did me wrong, but I have a massive amount of respect  for the dude. My point here is that while I was an asshole, I am not  and was not the kind of person who regularly used or manipulated other  people to settle some kind of vindictive streak. (Which was the specific  thing I was accused of by my Bad Ex when she got caught cheating, and  will become relevant later) But, for all of those reasons, those kinds  of accusations hit a very sore spot for me.\n\nNow,  sometime later, I end up leaving my really shitty job and I get a new  job working at the same company as $Friend, on her recommendation.  Shortly after that, due to the death of my grandmother, I ended up with a  small inheritance. It was a lot of money, to be sure, but I wasn't like  ultra rich or anything like that. $Friend mentions, in multiple  conversations, how lucky I was to get this inheritance, as it would play  no small part in me paying off some minor debts. (I wasn't close to my  grandmother at all, and she'd been catatonic for the better part of  three years-- so this isn't a \"Fuck your grandmother\" kind of  conversation. It's very much a \"Wow! What a windfall!\" kind of  conversation.) And she also mentions how burdened she is by debt  herself. Now, I've got my own stuff I have to take care of, but I'm in a  much better position financially than she is. So these conversations  were REALLY uncomfortable for me, because, real talk, I didn't want to  share my money, and it very much felt like that's what it was coming to.\n\nFinally,  one night she calls me, crying and sobbing about how overwhelming her  debt is. She beats around the bush a lot, but I finally bite the bullet  and say, \"Alright, you know what? I'll pay for some of it. How much is  your credit card debt?\"\n\n$2,000. Not as  bad as it could be-- I had never owned a credit card, but I've read  stories about people who are in debt their entire lives. Besides, she  DID help me get my new job. Which I love very much. But I need that  money to pay for my own stuff-- my car, my new apartment, moving, etc.\n\nSo  I tell her, \"I'll loan you $2,000, but I want it back. Not all at once,  but in a way that'll help you out of this hole you're in. We get paid  weekly, so I want $25 per paycheck. If you can't do it sometimes, that's  fine. Let me know-- I'm not going to come break your kneecaps over it,  but I DO want my money back.\"\n\nShe  agrees, but under one condition: I do NOT tell her $S/O. See, he doesn't  know about the credit card debt, and a condition he has for marrying  her is she gets her debt under control. Until then, he tells her when  she brings it up, marriage is off the table because he doesn't want to  be blindsided by that.\n\nI think that's a little odd, but whatever. Their relationship isn't any of my business.\n\nAnd,  to her credit, she does uphold her end of the bargain mostly. There are  some months where she can't afford to pay out anything-- and generally I  tell her \"Not a problem, get it to me when you can.\" She ends up paying  about 1/3 of what she owes, and I was, truthfully, quite happy with  that. I'm not a mobster-- I'm not harassing her over this.\n\nWell,  one day, the tags on her vehicle expire, and she can't get the time to  go and renew them. How about we just carpool to work, since we live in  the same city, work in the same company? She'll split the gas with me.  Hell yeah. I'm happy with this arrangement, too. At first.\n\nBut  the thing is, it gets to a point where being around her is just a  constant drain. She's always depressed about something--- and I want to  be a good, supportive friend, but I need a break. But she's feeling  anxiety about her apartment because she hasn't cleaned in awhile and she  \"doesn't have the spoons to deal with that right now\", and then she  accuses our company's IT guy of sexual assault and her boss is breathing  down her neck about some paperwork that needs to be filed and HR can't  find video footage of the assault because (she says) IT guy must have  erased it and the company's quotas aren't being met, and her job is  really difficult and so on and so forth. And $S/O is absolutely nowhere  to be seen during all of this--- he's always busy. He's in the military  and about to deploy, so when he's not on base he's trying to get in as  much time with his other friends as he can before he ships off to not  see them again for a few years. And she's upset and anxious about that,  too. And I want to be a good, supportive friend, but $Friend is always  upset about SOMETHING, and I'm a pretty social person but I have  absolutely no time to myself.\n\nMy daily routine has become this:\n\n\\- I wake up, shower, dress, get ready for work\n\n\\- I carpool $Friend, who is usually on my couch, to work\n\n\\- I work.\n\n\\-  I carpool $Friend back to our city. Sometimes we drop by her apartment  so she can get her work clothes for the next day. She then returns to my  couch. Sometimes, she needs to run other errands, and I take her there,  too, because she can't renew her tags due to some technical difficulty.\n\n\\-  She stops paying me back for the credit card debt. Times are tough, she  says, and she's got no money. Do I have any idea how hard it is to be a  woman in this economy? (She gets paid about $3 more than I do, so this  comment annoys me. I ask her, on multiple occasions, where all of that  money is going. She argues that because she's in a higher tax bracket  than I am, she actually makes less than I do. I don't buy it--- I point  out that she gets paid more after taxes than I do before taxes. The  argument goes on in circles. I eventually give up and the $25",

Most of these problems she's talking about can't be solved by **only** coming to us, such as being highly shaky or having migraines. She also has problems with her dad at home as far as I know, but I don't really know how often it is since I'm not her.  \nBefore this situation that I'm about to explain happened, we were basically best friends.  \n\n\nOne day she started to basically break down to me over the internet, and this is where I stopped talking to her mainly.  \nShe comes on asking me if she's being annoying, I ask her if there was a specific instance that made her feel that way and she said no. Seconds later completely out of the blue, she says she hates herself, wants to pretend she doesn't exist, and would be cutting herself if I didn't make her promise not to. (I made her promise not to when I first her about it because it gave me peace of mind to know she's okay.)  \n\n\nAt this point, I feel kind of annoyed since she comes to us every day with her problems and isn't taking her own steps to fix them. I say that I'd expect her own sense of integrity to do the right thing, not just my solemn promise. She says she just wants to be able to vent, that her anxiety is a hellish feeling, and that her giving her word to someone is important because her integrity won't do the right thing. I understand these things, but the main problem I'm having with it is that she isn't taking steps to confront her problems herself (as in get professional help) and, what feels to me, like she is looking for validation.  \n\n\nI took steps back from talking or inviting her to things lately because of this entire thing and because of how much stress I felt when I was dumping into this.

My uncle sees this and in a disgusted voice tells us to stop the \"indecent PDA\". His face is contorted in a hideous look of disgust. I calmly tell him that she is having a minor panic attack due to her fear of large crowds and this is how she calms down. He \"harumphs\" and turns away, muttering something I didn't quite catch due to the noise level. I roll my eyes and continue comforting her.\n\nThe next incident occurred while getting my seat.

Days before the trip I asked her if it was okay if I worked on some stuff for my Dungeons and Dragons games during the trip as it was an overall 14 hours of train riding and she said okay. Now the weekend was good besides that I got very ill on the third day. I had some tummy ache for a few days already and It got really bad one day, I threw up a lot too. I didn't want to cancel the trip however and pulled through, going to both dinner with her parents and her friends. I felt pretty miserable the last few days but I wouldn't be visiting her home town soon again so I didn't want to waste the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I actually hadn't done any work yet because the first 7 hours on the train we just talked a lot so I had no reason to. Same goes for the 7 hours back except for the last hour before she had to get off. We had nothing to talk about for the last 20 minutes or so already so I figured I could get some work in now else I get bored when I got nothing to do. My gf then started listening to music. Of course I closed my laptop in the last 10 minutes before approaching her station so we had some last time to smooch and cuddle before saying goodbye. So much about that. A few days later I went to the doctor to get my stomach checked. He did not find anything super worrying or irregular but took some probes and would get back to me with it on Monday. Now I told my gf basically everything he said in short Form and said she could ask me for more details in 2 days when we would videochat as I know she is noisy. Thing is I have some big anxiety problems and am an extreme introvert. Spending time with my gf is always exhausting for me because I am so close to another person 24/7 and I told her that's the case. So naturally 5 days without ever an hour to recharge my social batteries alone but instead meeting lots of new people that are important to my gf in a place that I do not know is extremely mentally exhausting for me. So I really needed some alone time after this which is why I didn't want to talk on the phone about my doctor's visit until our video chat.\n\n\n\n\nNow I got a text from her and she is really pissed at me for pulling out my laptop to work in that last hour saying it felt super insulting and hurtful. \nSame goes for telling her we will talk about the details of my doctors visit during our video chat, she says it's super rude to not know what happened during your friend's doctor's visit until 2 days after, even though I really told her all the important stuff that happened. \nShe says she always thought we had different understandings of kindness and not being rude and looks away often enough but this was to much for her. \nAITA?",

Tells me that paypal is a shit thing to use.

It's been hard and has caused a lot of emotional tension within my family, but we are slowly working through it with therapy and family/grief counseling. My mother and I went to visit my sister's grave yesterday, but we had a last minute guest: her boyfriend.\n\nThough I hesitate to call him her boyfriend for reasons that will soon become apparent, it is true that he was the last person to see her alive. They did mutually care for one another and spent time together, so it wasn't completely out of the ordinary for him to want to come with us on the eve of her passing. \n\nHowever, there are a few things that have further soured my already not-great view of him:\n\n* Despite saying how deeply he cared about her, he says that this is the first time that he has visited her grave since her passing. My family has visited several times over the past year, either as a group or individually/in pairs. He had plenty of chances to join us, or even come on his own.\n* They \"dated\" for only 4 months, yet says that he \"knew her better than anyone\". He says this in front of a mourning mother and a brother that not only spent a good portion, if not their entire, life with her. Taking her to and from counseling, hospitals, police stations, and so on.\n* I say \"dated\" because he convinced her to leave her boyfriend to be with him. He also impregnated her, which she later miscarried. I cannot know for sure if this had any impact on her final decision. \n\nThere are other things that have led me to my negative view of him that I won't get into for the sake of brevity. However, my mother wishes to continue inviting this man into our life and home. I can only assume that this is because he is the last person to see my sister alive. From what I understand, it wasn't anything of note, nothing extraordinary, he was just as shocked as we were. However, given his attitude and his role in my sister's life, I want nothing to do with him and would rather him not bother my family again. I have encouraged my mother to talk to her therapist about this, as I don't want her to become codependent on him. And maybe I'm being paranoid or cynical, but I don't want this guy to try and take advantage of my family.\n\nI'm dreading the next time she invites him into our home because she will see how not-thrilled I am, will ask why, and will invariably becomes upset if I tell the truth because I'm denying her the opportunity to indulge in what I think is something potentially unhealthy. \n\nI know she misses her daughter.

The other counselors sometimes joked that he was high all the time.\n\nOne night I decided to google him to see if there were any videos of him playing trombone in a concert. To my shock, the first results that popped up detailed a hit-and-run incident that resulted in one death and a conviction.\n\nThe details are pretty horrifying, so I won\u2019t go too much into them: according to witnesses, he hit an elderly man crossing the street, didn\u2019t stop or even slow down, and was later arrested after hitting a tree seemingly in an attempt to cover up the dent mark. Apparently he was intoxicated when this happened.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me a while to process this. We got pretty close this past summer, playing card games and joking around during camp. He\u2019s been nothing but incredibly kind to everyone around him, so seeing his smiling mugshot right after such an awful incident was just painful. I know I\u2019ll run into him sometime in the future, either at school or at the local music store, and I don\u2019t know exactly how I\u2019d react to seeing him again.\n\nOn one hand, I think this is a very serious crime made much worse by him trying to cover up his actions instead of calling an ambulance or the police. It was a severe blow to the level of respect I had for him. \n\nOn the other, he\u2019s already gone through the court system and whatever legal reprimand he received. And he hasn\u2019t done anything to me personally- it\u2019s not like he hit one of my relatives with his car.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make him trying to fix his life any harder than it already is. But I also think this crime shows a huge character flaw and I think I would be a little afraid to be around him. WIBTA for acting distant or just cordial if/when I see him again? \n\n",

After they split he only made one swing at me when I was 15, but acted really creepy towards me, including following all of my buses home from college on his bike without me knowing, and checking me after I showered (up to when I was a teenager) to make sure I was \u201cclean enough\u201d, once making me shower four times in a row because I didn\u2019t meet his standards. (Him calling me \u201cfaggot\u201d every five minutes was mild in comparison.)\n\nMy mother became increasingly overbearing - walking me to and from school (when I was a teenager), and even as I got older I wasn\u2019t allowed to dress myself, choosing my outfits every morning down to the socks. As I matured it became more and more of a burden. She didn\u2019t have very much luck with men, and when she eventually got rejected, used me as a kind of emotional leaning post, telling me it\u2019s my job \u201cto make your mother feel better\u201d. I was always happy to cheer her up, but constantly taking care of her when she got dumped seemed almost pointless, as she never let me cry to her like this, telling me to \u201cman up\u201d. Just before I turned 11, she got a job as a catering assistant at my school, originally I thought nothing of it but she eventually got contact numbers for all of my teachers, and spoke to my head of year regularly to make sure I wasn\u2019t \u201ccausing any trouble\u201d.\n\nShe later got with this guy (we\u2019ll call him P) in late 2013, and very quickly moved in with him, taking me with her. Right from the beginning P only let me eat one meal a day, locked me in the house while nobody else was in, blocked me from the Internet (when I had assignments due) and made me shower in cold water (I was a \u201cdrain on resources\u201d). He took my TV away, as well as my phone and laptop every night. Mum never stepped in, and when P eventually kicked me out, spent the entire night crying and begging HIM not to leave her.\n\nI eventually found out that when she moved out with P, she took all the money from my savings account (in early 2014). I also happened to find out that they got themselves into \u00a320k\u2019s worth of debt by taking out loans they couldn\u2019t afford to pay back, ending up with a county court summons. (Not helped by P\u2019s refusal to get a job for over a year). I firmly believe that they only wanted me there to help them pay their rent and bills.\n\nI don\u2019t blame my mum for what\u2019s happened to her, but I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her for just standing by while my mental state got worse and worse.\n\nI live in a house share a few miles away, but I\u2019ve secured a place at a university even further away and I plan on moving near there, and changing my number and email address without telling them. I feel awful for even thinking about it, but it\u2019s my last resort and I feel the only way that I can actually be happy.\n\nTL;DR: Parents were dicks, mum stole money from me and wouldn\u2019t support me, I want to cut all contact with them",

Sometimes he even doesn't flush the toilet and our mom and I have to be the unsuspecting victims.\n\nHe NEVER washes his hands after using the toilet and when I hear him come out of the toilet straight after flushing I have to ask him to wash his hands, and often he'll throw a strop and barely run his hands under water for 2 seconds. The other day I told him to wash his hands and he called me a whiney bitch and said he was going to shower in a few minutes anyway so it didn't matter. I've tried numerous times to tell him to make it a habit to wash his hands, I even hung a sign saying \"Please flush &amp; wash your hands\" on the door.\n\nAnyway my older sister who's moved out gave me a custom-made mug as a gift, one of those that has an image appear when it's filled with a hot drink. I was showing my brother like \"yo this is so cool\" and he said \"let me see\" and grabbed it out of my hand to look at it. I immediately got disgusted, took it back and said \"don't touch it\" and my mum was like \"whoa you're brother and sister, why can't he see?\" and I said \"I don't mind [brother] looking but God knows where those hands have been, I'd rather he not touch anything of mine.\" He got offended and said he hadn't even used the toilet today and his hands were clean. First of all I didn't mention the toilet once. Secondly, you see earlier that day I had gone to the toilet and saw piss in it with the toilet seat up and he's the only guy in the house so I kinda assumed he was lying and said \"So not only are you disgusting but you're a liar too.\" He stormed off and has been pissed with me since then.\n\nI didn't think I was out of line at the time but I do feel guilty now and my mom said I was absolutely the one at fault here and because we're family it shouldn't matter whether he touches my stuff, and I overreacted and treated him like an outsider.

He threatens to kick her out all the time but never goes through with it. he calls her a whore , a psycho. And she calls him a loser and a piece of shit and well ...just all manner of crap . They both have jobs but they refuse to save up any money To get up off their feet they spend it on wish or amazon and cigarettes but never put anything away. Usually peoples expenses would be absolutely NONE of my business but its been a year and they shouldve been way better off by now but they arent . Its frustrating my parents and they give ME a lot of shit about it . And its driven a noticeable wedge in our friendship every time I try and sit and talk to him about the situation.

His parents are always watching him and making sure he\u2019s being safe, but it\u2019s tiring to be super vigilant after the first couple of weeks, so they topped watching him as closely. I understand that. They still look up from whatever they\u2019re doing every 45 seconds or so so whatever. But we live across the street from the elementary school that everyone goes to, so every school morning the street is packed with school parent\u2019s cars because no one wants to use the small parking lot that is under construction. I was walking my kid to school and Billy turns from around a pick up truck and is going full speed at my boy. This was the biggest scare I\u2019ve gotten since my kid almost got ran over but my wife pulled him away. I guess I was having some PTSD but an incredible load of adrenaline shot through me and I grabbed my kid and yanked him by the backpack into the car to my left and I grabbed The Cart as the other kid was riding it and flipped it sideways. Luckily Billy was wearing a helmet because he kept sliding while sideways and his helmet has a few scrapes on it. As soon as I saw that my kid was fine I rushed over to Billy.

It is important to note that one of the women has feelings for my girlfriend, they went on one date before we got together and my gf told her that she didn\u2019t feel a spark and moved on. The woman, however, has a habit of telling my gf she still likes her when she gets drunk, but that\u2019s a story for another day. Gf usually ignores or reiterates she isn\u2019t interested. We started drinking and all got caught in a transient rainstorm so trooped back to my girlfriends house which was the closest to dry our hair and get warm before we went back out to continue. Everything was going fine, we arrived back and popped the fire on then started taking it in turns to dry our hair using her hairdryer in the living room.\n\nMy girlfriend disappeared to her room to change her trousers into dry ones with it being her house, the next thing I know she\u2019s back in the living room wearing a short top and *nothing* on her lower half other than a pair of high cut black underpants. I was confused, she\u2019d just come from her room with plenty of trousers to wear, I asked her why she was half naked and she told me she was drying her trousers on the radiator and was waiting for them to be ready but skirted around why she hadn\u2019t just put some shorts/trackies/anything on in the interim.\n\nShe then proceeded to walk around the living room like this for a while, I noticed the other women looking uncomfortable and the woman who is attracted to her also looking awkward. The next day when we were sober and alone I told her I thought it was inappropriate, especially considering she\u2019s aware one of her friends still has feelings for her.

The death was unexpected and I was there with my fiancees family the whole time, spending three days in a hospital. I am behind with work and I sleep at my in laws parents to support them, because they don't want to be alone and to help with planning the funeral. This may cloud my judgement. \n\nToday I went to visit my mother at the request of my fiancee who wanted to be somewhere more quiet and to talk to someone who is not so affected by the loss. I came, even though I actually had work to do to see my mother who I hadn't in a whole and for some rest.\n\nNow my car is on my mother's parking place for a while. I asked her this a while ago, because she doesn't have a car, can't drive. Storing a car there is free, as is it at my place. I just don't have a personal parking space and the kids in my neighbourhood blow stuff around new years. She said it was no problem.\n\nWhen I visited a while back the car was somewhere else in the street parked badly and unlocked. My brother had moved it because he needed the space to move something heavy. I told him that I would prefer if he would tell me he moved it (not ask for permission, just a text with hey I moved your car). Also lock the door and park a bit more social next time. I could park the car more social because of the accident I can't drive right now.\n\nWhen we visited my mother today the car was gone. I was really scared it was stolen. I came into the house and my grandfather was there and told us that my mother was gone with my grandmother in my car for some errands. I didn't like this because she again didn't tell me (I only want a text) and my grandmother was there in her own car. They just took it because mine is smaller and my grandmother doesn't like driving in big cars.\n\nWhen they came back, I didn't say anything, because I'm tired and stressed and I don't want to have a fight. Then myother told me she gave the keys to a neighbour I don't know yesterday because the neighbour asked if it could be parked better. I blew up at this. I have asked so many times to just tell me. If the car could be there anymore fine, I'll try and get somebody to pick it up. My fiancee would move it today. But I have said again and again just please tell me. Be a bit respectful of my (for me expensive) stuff.\n\nI shouldn't have gotten so angry, but am I the asshole for getting upset for something I asked them again and again.

I got a private consult with an animal trainer and she advised I go to a nearby park where dogs are nearby so that I can start to desensitize my dog to others and generally make her more sociable. That's the backstory\n\nSo I am at the park having a picnic in a secluded area with my gf and the dog when out of nowhere a purebred St Bernard comes jogging up to our picnic and comes right up to me and my dog. I jump up to create space between my dog and the St Bernard and my poor gf is too overwhelmed to react or move at all. \n\n\nThe St Bernard seems friendly but won't give me or my dog personal space so I push it a few times and it just keeps walking back over to me still being friendly. My dog is terrified but also showing signs that she'll attack. Finally I hear a man calling the dog from about 15 or 20 yards away, but he's not really in a hurry. \n\nSo I address the guy, I'm talking loud and I'm being stern. I say \"Come get your dog man\". The guy starts walking over faster but while doing so starts to lecture me about being making a big deal over nothing. So I tell him \"It's an on leash dog park(author note: signs posted at entrance, $200 fine). Come get your fucking dog\". He then tells me that having a dog off leash is like going 5 over the speed limit and that I'm being ridiculous. And that there's a group of dog owners who all have well behaved dogs and they don't mind each other going off leash in this particular park. I didn't respond to any of that. He had his dog at that point and I just let him walk away without a response. \n\n\nWas my reaction appropriate? Should I have been more understanding? Thank you for reading this non-proofread mess.

He tells me he has trouble with his memory but seems to remember things that suit him fine (his friends birthdays, things i've said that suit his needs). I didn't make much of a big deal out of it at the time, just said I was a bit upset, and asked him to put it in his calendar for next year (which I had to do because it was too much effort for him).\n\nPartner forgot to wish me a Merry Christmas. He doesn't celebrate it, so I didn't expect a gift or anything, but he didn't even say it to me, yet I know he said it to a lot of his friends and family (facebook), and he knows my family celebrate it hard core. \n\nPartner forgot Valentines day. Same theme as Christmas, but this time he jokingly wished his \"husbands\" (aka his friends) a Happy Valentines while I didn't get a word.\n\nA couple of days after valentines day it was his birthday. I had all ready agreed to go out with him and his friends for dinner, but before hand I wanted to do some personal shopping (like 3 hours before hand, I wasn't late to his dinner). While I was out shopping (he knew where I was, location wise) he asks me to drive an hour or so in the opposite direction to his place (where I was heading after my shopping) in order to get him something for his Birthday. \n\nI told him no. I told him he knew where I was going, that I was going to be far away from the requested shop before I left my home, and that if he had of wanted something he should have asked me before I left. I also told him he could go to another place closer to his (but still out of my way, on the way to his) to get what he wanted. He got uppity about it. He also knew I was very strapped for cash at the time because I have been off work for almost a month ill, and that what he wanted was very expensive. \n\nHim and his friends spent the entire evening being rude about me not having gotten him what he asked for, so I spent my evening being snidely remarked too.

This is also a throwaway, although the names aren\u2019t the same, they\u2019re significant.\n\nI know that what we did was shitty, but i\u2019m going to explain some of the bs that went into this before we finally caved.\n\nTL;DR at bottom \n\n\nI met \u201cthe other roommate\u201d, we\u2019ll call her Cori, last year, she started dating my best friend, we\u2019ll call him Mitchell, in college, and he introduced me to her. For a while everything was cool, &amp; then one day she asked me if i wanted to live with her next year. At the time, i was still 17 because i\u2019d graduated high school early &amp; she was 20, so i thought it was a little strange, but i figured why not? Ya know? Mitchell would be there &amp; id have someone there to kinda help me out.\n\nFlash forward to summer, Cori lives 2 hours away from where Mitchell &amp; i live. He starts making trips out there and then being basically forced \u201cor so he said\u201d by her to stay. I don\u2019t care, i have other friends. Every time he does manage to come home, we get together &amp; he talks mad shit about the kinda person she is etc. says he wants to break up, you get it.\n\nHe breaks up with her for about a day, they immediately get back together. Flash forward to school starting, i meet our third roommate, call her Haley, Cori\u2019s best friend, &amp; i\u2019m kinda shy so we didn\u2019t become friend for awhile. \n\nDuring this beginning period of school, Mitchell gets pissed, breaks up with Cori, and then they get back together in about a week. This goes on for a couple weeks, &amp; he tells me that they\u2019re broken up, but it\u2019s cordial so he can still come hang out with me, he does, &amp; almost every time Cori would say some cryptic bull about \u201cneeding to talk to him\u201d in her room, &amp; they do that for 30 min- to an hour &amp; he tells me it\u2019s nothing, but i\u2019m not stupid, i know they\u2019re having sex.\n\nFinally they come back out as dating. Now here\u2019s where the main conflict starts, i found out later on that Cori used to go over to his house when they were \u201cbroken up\u201d &amp; tell him that she was going to kill herself, that he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s not eating, &amp; all this other stuff. She gets even more manipulative &amp; controlling, &amp; Mitchell starts staying &amp; basically living at this house that the 3 of us are splitting evenly in rent &amp; utilities. \n\nDuring this kinda in between period, like september to october, she\u2019s picking fights with me over him, saying rude comments, and generally just making me afraid to leave my room, (i actually stayed in my room for a full 36 hours at one point) and just forcing him to kinda put me out of his life. This was when Haley &amp; i became friends, along with her finding out from tons of mutual friends that Cori had been telling everyone that Haley was a slut etc., i got so angry one day that i threw all of Cori\u2019s chairs into our backyard, put them back, then went to my room &amp; punched a hole in my door. I thought I\u2019d broken my hand, Haley took me to the hospital, bam friendship was born. \n\nThings were iffy for awhile, just general bs. Haley would say she didn\u2019t want Mitchell at our house, Mitchell is literally living at our house. We\u2019d have a fight, they\u2019d stay at his place for a week or so, but they were always back. Plus, Haley &amp; i keep the house clean when it\u2019s just us, but Mitchell &amp; Cori are slobs, shit everywhere. Then Mitchell &amp; i started fighting, around Thanksgiving it gets really bad, i say i don\u2019t want him in my home, Haley doesn\u2019t want him in our home, &amp; i want his shit gone.\n\nThey leave to his house for a week. Mitchell &amp; i are no longer friends. Next week they\u2019re back, living at our home, Mitchell, at our home. Haley &amp; i decide to move out. Mitchell\u2019s &amp; my mutual friend, decided to move in with us. \n\nNext two months until yesterday we\u2019re busy getting our things in order for our new apartment. We find it &amp; start moving our things a few days ago &amp; yesterday when she saw us draining my waterbed our my window, she came out &amp; started screaming at us. \n\nWe took that load of stuff, dropped it off &amp; went back to get more, &amp; they had unplugged the garage door opener, put a handle on the front door (Mitchell had broken it &amp; taken it off with the intention of fixing it a few days ago &amp; then had just left it open) , had locked my bedroom window, &amp; locked the back door. Haley had to crawl in through the doggy door &amp; push the wood cover out of its slides. \n\nWhile Haley &amp; our mutual friend, let\u2019s call him Dawson, were moving out her wooden headboard, Cori &amp; Mitchell came to the garage door &amp; got into a fight with her where she said it was hers because it was made from materials on her ranch, &amp; Haley said fine, &amp; slammed the thing down on the floor of our garage, stepped on it, then tried to walk back into the house. \n\nHaley is not a huge fighter, but when she gets pissed she sees red, &amp; while she tried to walk in, Cori shouldered her hard, Haley automatically turned &amp; pushed her into my washing machine, and yelled at her. Mitchell has to keep them apart. About 15 minutes after that, there were two cops there, just \u201cmaking sure it went smoothly.\u201d We weren\u2019t there for that much longer, but the whole time Mitchell and Cori were out sucking up to the policemen.\n\nFound out later that they had already figured out where our new house was, we didn\u2019t want them to know, &amp; had toured it apparently. They\u2019re psychos. Just want to know if AITA or not. Sorry for long text.\n\n\nTL;DR: have a shitty roommate, her shitty boyfriend lived with us despite us not wanting him there, psychological/emotional abuse, didn\u2019t tell her we were moving until the day we were leaving.\n",

(Surgery, anesthetics, vet visits, antibiotics, etc.)\n\nMy vet posted his story to Facebook, with my permission, because hedgehogs are fairly unusual as pets and she was proud of saving his life. This is all fine, personally I don\u2019t use Facebook but apparently the post got a lot of traction within our community. \n\nApparently, our neighbors saw the post as well and showed the pictures of my little companion to their 5 year old son. \n\n*Side note: I\u2019m not close to my neighbors, just the occasional hello.*\n\nJust today, the father rang the doorbell and asked about Loki, referring to the post. It was kind of them to check up on him and I told them that he was doing well, to which he asked if they could see him. More specifically, if his son could see him. \n\nI understand that he is a rare pet and am aware of how exciting he must be to a kid, so I agreed. \n\nI asked them to come back later in the evening, since Loki is nocturnal and I avoid waking him up during the daytime (this was around 2PM, in Loki-time that\u2019s like being shaken awake at 2AM)\n\nHe agreed and came back around 4:30ish (PM), with their son. He was really excited about seeing my hedgehog, so I let them in and brushed over the fact that they ignored my request. Loki wouldn\u2019t be happy about me waking him up this early, but it would be fine. Plus, I don\u2019t know the kids schedule, so maybe anything later wouldn\u2019t have worked. \n\nI led everyone to my room and gently lifted the fleece blanket off my grumpy hedgie. After a while, he calms down.\n\nThe kid *looses his shit*. I mean excited squealing, jumping up and down, etc. This startled Loki and he curled up into a hissing ball (they\u2019re easy to startle), to which I picked him up to calm him down. \n\nThe parents then ask if their son can hold him as well. He gets even more excited. \n\nHere\u2019s where I want to know if I was the asshole: Hedgehog spikes can hurt when they\u2019re defensive, and I wouldn\u2019t trust a kid that young not to drop him out of fright. My hedgehog doesn\u2019t know his scent and the kid was very fidgety prior to this, so I was concerned that this would scare Loki and lead to him being held improperly or dropped. And most importantly, I didn\u2019t want to risk any further stress after his surgery story. \n\nI was polite, but firm when I said no.\n\nThe kid was upset, but ultimately understood and thanked me gloomily for showing him my pet. Despite being unhappy about not being allowed to hold him, but took it very gracefully. (Especially for a kid that young!)\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: When we were at the door, the mom pulled me aside and told me that it was unnecessary of me to refuse her sons wish and that I had made him upset. She still thanked me, but shook her head as she left. \n\nAm I the asshole? Could I have handled it better? ",

(You can probably see where this is going, but I'll continue regardless.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options to take this class are as follows: 1) Take the class this summer at the school I attend currently. This will keep me on time to graduate and cost me nothing extra as financial aid will cover the cost. 2) Wait and take the class next semester as a transient student at another school an hour away at out of state tuition costs out of my own pocket. Financially, this will ruin me but I will only be behind a semester 3) Forego the class for a year and take it next summer, essentially putting my academics on hold for a year. I would really rather not do this, but with family matters it gets touchy, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I am heavily leaning towards option 1, as the other options would cost me time or money that I would prefer not to spend. However, I'm sure my parents would be disappointed I wouldn't be able to attend the get-together and might not be pleased at my decision. I'm at a loss for what I should do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr Would I be an asshole for ditching a family vacation to take an important required class for my degree?",

For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?",

At 15 I started in drivers ED, and ended up passing the written test just fine. After that I began doing the driving practice, and I really struggled. Practicing was hard, specifically driving with my parents. My mom would freak out really easily, and I felt really nervous around my dad and definitely made a lot of mistakes. I eventually took a road test and failed, and that discouraged me for a few months, but then I got really dedicated to practicing, and tried again. I failed a second time due to the parallel parking.\n\nI got really dedicated on the third time. My parents hired a private instructor, and I really tried my best. At this point though, I still did not feel like I was a good driver. I knew my weaknesses, and in certain high risk situations, my instincts were often incorrect, leading to a couple close calls.\n\nOn my third road test, things were going fine for the most part, but near the end, I ended up getting into a collision. On my road test. It was awful. It was entirely my fault, and I was extremely ashamed. Since then, I have not reattempted to take a road test.\n\nThe rest of my life has been largely unaffected. I lived on campus in university, so I had no need for a car (and no access to one to practice again for a road test) after that, I moved downtown and was within walking distance of my job. Currently I take public transit and it's not really an issue for me, and I'm pretty self sufficient without a car and can take Uber if I need too. I am a successful well adjusted adult.\n\nI don't want to get a car, or my license, because I am concerned that I will get into an accident, harming myself, someone else, or potentially members of my family. The issue is that my wife has a car, and does all of the driving. Now, a part of me feels bad, that I should be sharing that responsibility, but I am legitimately concerned for our safety if I was driving. I don't want to deal with the judgement of our families, but I also don't want to put our future kids at risk while driving with me.\n\nOn the other hand, that will be a lot more responsibility for my wife if she has to drive the kids everywhere. I'm hoping that either I can find other ways to help out in the future.\n\nTLDR; I'm a bad driver, and probably a risk to be on the road. I don't think I should get my license for my own safety, and the safety of others. I feel bad though, like I am not contributing enough by not getting it, and face judgement from extended family.\n\nAITA for not wanting to drive?\n",

So I look up some details on the author's most popular series (the Broken Earth trilogy) and found that there were many LGBTQ+ characters.  This didn't bug me as I have read books with gay characters before such as Rick Riordan's books (in one book there is a character who literally switches between being a boy and a girl randomly) and Perks of Being a Wallflower.  Afterwards, I found this quote that she said and to sum it up she said that all of her books feature her personal political views heavily.  \u201cBut what I write ends up being very political. If I write about dragons, I\u2019m writing about dragons as a black woman, and it\u2019s fucking political.\u201d \n\nI brought this stuff up with my friend and she said that it was kind of true and that there was even a sex scene with two guys in it.  I told her that I don't think that I want to read the series because as a straight guy I don't want to read about sex between two guys and that I don't like it when authors get political in fictional books.  She said that I was being homophobic and that if the sex scene had two girls in it instead that I would be all for it.  I tried to tell her that as a straight guy, reading about a sex scene between two guys and two girls weren't really comparable.  I told her that I've read books with gay characters before and she said that is basically the same as someone saying \"I'm not homophobic, I have gay friends.\"\n\nMy sister (whose gay) says that she understands that a straight person wouldn't want to read about that but that I should still buy the book and just skip the scene when it comes up.  My parents say that I don't need to buy anything that I'm not 100% for.  But now I feel kinda guilty and am starting to think that there is something wrong with my POV.  I mean gay people watch straight romance scenes (at least my sister does) but I always skip romantic scenes with two guys whenever they show up in a show or movie.

By the end of our time abroad we'd pretty much been a couple for several months in terms of how things were when we were alone together. When we were around friends though it changed and everything had to be kept a secret, which took a significant toll on my mental health. \n\nAfter our time abroad she broke up with her boyfriend and went back to her home country in Europe and I went back to Australia. She didn't want a label but she wanted me to come visit her around my exam time and when I told her I couldn't she got nasty saying that I would never achieve any of my goals because I couldn't follow through with little things like travelling to see her. This was one criticism amongst many that she had including criticising my choice of engineering discipline because it showed disregard for the environment, as well as for the political affiliations of my friends, not being vegetarian and a few other things.\n\nThe constant criticism hurt me, I felt very depressed at this point, a lot due to me not re-adjusting to life at home after my year abroad, but the relationship didn't help either. Before she met me there was another guy she had feelings for who left because of her boyfriend. Hearing that she was then single, he came back into her life and they started travelling together and I felt very uncomfortable with it, and despite the fact she promised that it was me she wanted, I didn't feel I could trust her. This was the point where I had enough and I stopped responding to a lot of her messages. She ramped up the scale of the abusive messages she'd send and at times she'd hit a nerve and I'd respond. \n\nFor about 6 months this carried on until she called me out for being an asshole who didn't ever care for her and was too immature to hold down a relationship. I did know that she was also struggling with depression as much as I was, but I felt so much better not talking to her so I just couldn't bring myself to respond, or really communicate that to her. I know I should've tried explaining that to her but I found it too difficult at the time. \n\nWhen I finally got around to explaining that I left because she was hurting me, and apologised for not communicating or ending it in the healthiest way, she told me that I was just trying to make myself out to be a good person when I'm not by apologising and didn't believe I was genuinely sorry. She believes that me handling breaking it off by not responding to messages was much more harmful than anything she ever did to me and that I'm the asshole here.

Our friends Morgan and Maddie joined us to babysit. \n\nOn a Saturday around 1pm Erin and I take the tabs and have a fun time wandering around. By about 9pm, the acid was wearing off and we all laid on the couches. Erin and I weren\u2019t seeing any visuals anymore, but we both said we still could feel \u2018shiney\u2019 still, as in still felt remnants.\n\nMorgan and Maddie were off in another room talking while Erin and I were on the couch. I ask Erin if she wants to smoke with me (to get a last little bump from the trip). She declined right away (she doesn\u2019t like smoking). She then asked if I had any more edibles. I did, so I grabbed one for each of us and we chomped them down. \u2018They\u2019re gonna be mad\u2019, Erin laughed. I laughed too and we joked about it being our secret.\n\nThe girls rejoin us and we keep watching TV. About an hour later Erin sits up and grabs my arm: \u2018it just hit me\u2019, she gasped.\n\n\u2018What hit her? What\u2019s going on?!\u2019 The girls demand. We tell them we took edibles. They are unhappy with this choice.\n\nErin grabbed her head and told us she was getting paranoid. I get her some water. It doesn\u2019t help; she\u2019s in a bad place, spiraling out. I take her for a walk and sit with her by the kitchen table. She can hold a conversation and can follow what\u2019s happening on TV, but it having a terrible time. I feel miserable about the whole thing- paranoia is terrible but it\u2019s something you have to just wait out to feel better, so all I can do is sit with Erin and wait for it to pass.\n\nMorgan and Maddie announce they\u2019re going for a drive. I say okay. They leave.\n\nAfter about 90 minutes of paranoia, Erin finally calms down but is really shaken up by the whole thing. We talk about it for a while until she is calm enough to joke a little about the night. We watch a little more tv then both go to bed.\n\nMaddie and Morgan never came back. I snapped Maddie to ask where they were, and she replied that she had gone downtown and that Morgan went home. Morgan didn\u2019t text or call at all.\n\nThe next morning, Morgan calls me and bitches me out for giving Erin drugs. She says it was stupid of me to give her an edible and that I was an asshole because I knew she was already on meds for a sinus infection paired with her first trip, that my carelessness put Erin in a ton of danger, that I didn\u2019t care at all about Erin\u2019s well being, that I\u2019m a bad friend, that it's disrespectful of me to not ask or tell her or Maddie about the edibles until something bad happened. I think she's overreacting, she thinks I don't understand the severity of my actions.\n\nI need some perspective: am I the asshole Morgan thinks I am?\n\nTLDR; Erin and I drop acid together. 8 hours later, I give her an edible to boost the end of the trip. She gets super paranoid for 90mn. Our sober friend blames my thoughtlessness for endangering Erin and says I\u2019m an asshole.",

            "input": "Not sure if this is the right sub for this; I had a disagreement with an officer this morning and cant find any legal requirement to yield to an emergency vehicle without lights/sirens.\n\nA little back story here; My morning commute is 45 minutes mainly interstate driving of which I typically travel in the passing lane. Posted limit is 65 and I typically travel 75-80 in the left lane by no means do I intentionally hold up the lane. In my area police have a tendency to tailgate (no sirens or lights) and push people out of lane. I think this is an abuse of power, a small one but abuse none the less. Several days ago an officer began tailgating me going 70-75 in a fairly congested area, when I didn't yield the lane the sirens came on and when I was finally able to move over the lights went off till he reached the next person. Rinse and repeat. I have a dash-cam and saved the video but doubt anything will come of it.\n\nFlash forward to this morning. Similar situation I'm traveling about 75 and spot the cop car closing in so I decide to turn cruise control on and keep it at 72 (over 85 is considered reckless in my state) fast enough to still pass the right lane but under the reckless limit. He eventually catches up and begins tailgating, I maintain my speed and stay in lane. He flashes the highs at me and I hold my lane, this continues for about 2 miles and finally the lights and sirens come on.\n\nI pull over and he asks why I didn't just yield the lane to which I ask why he was tailgating me. He says he wasn't and I was being pulled over for going 76 in a 65, I direct his attention to my dash which shows the current settings for my cruise control. He then redirects and says I was delaying him from getting to an accident. At this point I'm getting heated because I feel I'm being lied to and he can tell. I ask him why he wasn't using his sirens or top lights if he was on his way to an accident, he then \"corrects\" me and says it's not an accident but an incident. They are supposedly searching a wooded area for someone...I repeat my question to which he answers \"sirens weren't warranted\" to which I reply \"yielding my lane to high beams isn't warranted\". He tells me I was now being disrespectful, I let him know that it was not my intention but I was fed up with the abuse of authority minor or otherwise and fill him in on my recent experience with an officer using his siren to circumvent other commuters and follow up with another question. If your on the way to assist in a search why are you wasting time pulling me over wouldn't it have been faster to use your emergency equipment from the start? After some more round about question and answer he hands me back my documentation and tells me it seems to him I've had a bad experience with another officer and was having a bad morning so he'd let me go with a warning. We shake hands and he pulls off back into the passing lane with no sirens to his \"incident\".",

            "input": "   I didn't really intentionally single her out, but I needed time away at the time. She broke up with me about half a year ago. Well, we actually broke up twice.\n\n   First time, she broke up with me and told me she doesn't know why it isn't working, she just can't continue on the relationship if she doesn't feel anything. Which I respect, of course at the time though I was angry and depressed. Emotions took over me and I just couldn't really look at her or speak to her. I went to my group of friends (which were hers too) who consoled me and took my side on the matter, saying that I was too good for her. That same night, she calls me and asks if we should get back together because she was crying and felt that maybe there was something there. I said no, I was furious because she put me through those just to get back with me anyways. Fourth day after that break-up she calls me again saying she missed me and would like to get back together again. I will admit, the previous three days, I was going through a bunch of emotions, I went from not wanting to see her, to wanting to get back together with her and try again, then to finally just being friends. Back to her asking me to get back together: I stupidly said yes. Without thinking about the possible reasons besides \"she missed me\".\n\n   Second time, we broke up 2 weeks later. During those two weeks, I ended up explaining to my friends that me and my Ex we're trying thing out again, which they were not very supportive of, but they acted like it and hoped it would go well. My Ex ended up making a new friend and brought him into our friend group, who she ended up being suspiciously over-friendly with, but I tried to ignore it. Nothing changed in the relationship between me and her. It was just like before and she wasn't trying to better things between us no matter how hard I tried. So I confronted her, I asked if she really wanted stay together. Silence then \"I don't know\". To which I replied \"If you really can't give me an answer, then that's a no.\" And we broke up there.\n\n   Now this is where it all happens. I didn't feel much after the second break-up because I've come to terms that it wasn't going to work. My Ex wanted to give me privacy with our group of friends (which were my group of friends first, I introduced her to them), so she didn't hang out with us for a while, which I didn't really want her to, and honestly neither did my friends. I started thinking about more of the reason WHY she broke up with me then got back together with me. Which I with my friends, concluded that it seems that she only wanted to get back together because she missed our group, not me. That really pissed me off. This was about a week after our break up. My friends start feeding me rumors and gossip about my Ex and her new friend (the one I mentioned in the last paragraph) were looking kind of being too close. Which I shouldn't feel that mad about, because we weren't together and she had every right. I did end up talking shit behind her back with my friends, which I kinda feel bad about. My friends told me about all the weird and selfish things she has done, without me around, along with all the times she kinda flirted with other guys while we were together. All of those gossips and thoughts infuriated me to the point where I completely ignored her. I couldn't see her at all without getting mad, she really wanted to be friends with me again, but I was suspicious because I believe she was just trying to get back into MY group of friends.\n\n   She finally confronted me directly after weeks of me ignoring her and not wanting to see her. She convinced me to talk. Not really talk, it was more of an argument. I confronted her about her new friend and the reason of her wanting to be my friend so that she could get back into my group. She denied both saying it wasn't true and that the new friend was just that, a friend. I didn't believe her. She told me how I was a jerk for ignoring her and not confront her about these things sooner, the reason for that was because I couldn't even talk to her without getting pissed. Afterwards, I leave and end up regretting not making things better between us. I hate holding a grudge. I end up getting one of my friends to be a mediator and we talked a second time. We agreed to be friends and hugged on it.\n\n  It's been about five months since then, we talk every once in a while. She ended up getting together with her new friend, which I wasn't surprised about at all. But she never went to our get-togethers out of fear of it being awkward and not the same after the break-up aftermath, which it wouldn't be. My friends and I didn't really try to invite my Ex to anything. My friends didn't have a high opinion of her, they thought she was selfish and was using me, mind you I did a lot of things for her and rarely got anything in return. She talked to one of my friends (who was a girl and was the closest to her) about how she missed everyone, that she didn't regret the break-up but she regrets how it all went down. Which my friend said that it was weird. I do feel bad and didn't mean to exclude her, I just didn't try to include her. But that's how it went, and I'm not really doing anything to change it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My Ex and I broke up twice. She wanted to be my friend again, which we ended up doing, however I had a suspicion that she only wanted to be my friend to get back into our group. My friends didn't really like her anyways. I feel bad for unintentionally excluding her from any group activities. She's a nice enough girl but she is pretty selfish.",

I haven't seen here in 2 1/2 years and when i saw her last week, it was great to catch up with her. Shes always open and a good person to have discussions with.

The trip is going fine but one of the things that have been bothering me really gets under my skin. I've asked here multiply times for her not to do it but she keeps doing it or says \" i do it cause im like our mother\". The mother joke was funny at first but now it has really gotten under my skin. However, i still just drop it and let it go. Later in the same day we are checking into our hostel. I had to book us a separate rooms (mixed room because im male and females cause she is a girl)  . As the hostel managers tell us this i make the joke \"ill take the ladies room key\" and my sister yells very loud and within in ear shot of other guests in the lobby \"don't be such a creep!\". I was very shocked and embarrassed cause it seemed like she was trying to shame me in front of other people. (the joke can be seem creepy but people always mistake me as woman/my sister makes jokes about me cause i look like a woman cause i have long hair and such.)

(i never read other peoples phones/look at their personal stuff  cause  i dont want them doing it to me. respect each others privacy) . what i saw she sent to her close friend was \"all he has been doing is looking at girls and like degrading girls\" (not sure if that was the whole text so i could be wrong and im being an asshole).  When i see this i legit get angry and go off a bit. I felt very betrayed that my sister/ best friend would talk behind my back negatively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfirst: it bothers me because i never talk about the things that bother me about my sister to anyone. shes my best friend and even the days were im mad at her or she annoys me i dont say anything about it to anyone. i say it to her.  i have a dialog with her. i just never thought my sister would do something like this. I feel like i cant trust her now cause she will take any my opinions and tell everyone about them. i dont like people telling wrong portrayals of me (unless that person has met me and made their own conclusion about me). \n\nsecondly: I'm a very shy guy and can never talk to girls. im always trying to respect woman cause my best friend is my sister, im close with my mom and i hangout with alot of girls. I try my best everyday to be a living example of integrity, and degrading woman is not in that definition. she has told me years ago i am  \" hyper-sexually\". when she told me that i made sure to turn things down or just not bringing up those topics up with her. during this trip, (to my memory) i might have noticed a girl in passing and took a look at her or said to my sister\" that girl looks good\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow in the past few days ive only answered her questions with yes or no. or given her the information she needs. try and not say anything that might cause her to assume something about me or misinterpret my opinion. I usually can forgive and not care. but with this i can forgive her but i dont want to trust her. and now im sure im making things awkward cause  i dont want to talk to her unless its necessary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo im sure many of you  will agree, im being an asshole. thoughts? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have a tax return coming in of about $2,000, and leftover christmas/birthday money of about $500. This puts me at a total of about $11,000. I plan on going to work right after school, and I want to get a motorcycle because, 1) I have the money, and 2) I have always wanted one.\n\nMy buddy has a motorcycle, and is willing to sell it to me for about $3,300. After this purchase, my savings would be at about $7,700. My mother\u2019s arguement, is that I should establish myself, before I spend money on a luxury item. My arguement is, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything. I would pay for it, pay for insurance, and pay for any maintenence. My mom says that I still live under her roof, and I would be keeping it in her garage. She even threatened to kick me out. (I couldn\u2019t tell if she was joking or not...)\n\nAITA for wanting to buy a motorcycle, with my saved up money that I earned, and not having my parents worry about anything changing expense wise. Or is my mom right and I should get more ahead in life, before I buy something like this?\n\nThanks for any responses. First time posting here, and I\u2019m also on mobile.",

I really hate putting my personal business on the internet, but I'm really conflicted here.\n\nSorry for the length - I just want to make sure I'm painting the full picture.\n\nBackground\n\nI have primary custody of my son from a previous marriage, and he must to go to school in whatever school district I live in. The separation/divorce was in 2011/2012 (he was 5) and was particularly hard on him. His mother has some significant mental health issues, and as much as I have tried, his mother and I are unable to have a stable, amicable relationship. I know this takes a toll on his well-being and although I can't force an amicable relationship with his mother, I've done my best to provide a stable home/life when he is with me. I have striven for creating a consistent routine and my son and I have a good relationship and healthy communication, but he has obviously been deeply affected by the entire process.\n\nI met my SO three years ago; she has a young son that was not school age at the time. Not shortly after we started dating, she moved closer to me (her lease was up). However, she is extremely close with her family and this move put her roughly 50 minutes away from them. It became a major issue; my SO suffers from anxiety and depression and the distance from her family was really taking a toll on her and our relationship. As her lease was nearing the end of the first year, she wanted us to move in together but also wanted to be closer to her family.  Her preference was to be within the same city as them and approximately 10 minutes away from her mother and two sisters. At the time I didn't want to move my son out of his school system. He was just starting fourth grade and because of the divorce this was the second school system that he was in. He had friends and he and I both enjoyed the school, teachers, and staff. Moreover, if we would have moved to my SO's preferred location we most likely would have had a court fight due to distance from my son's mother. Against my better judgement my SO and I compromised on a new location that was known for having a stellar school system and that kept me in a range that wouldn't cause problems with my son's mother or the court. Our compromised location put her within 20-30 minutes of her mom and sisters. We agreed that this move was supposed to be our final major move and that the goal was to plant roots in the community. We have lived in this community for a little over two years now (her son is in first grade here now and my son is in sixth), and my son has started sports here. \n\nThe Breakdown\n\nEver since we moved my SO continued to hint that she would rather have moved to her preferred location. It was never a huge fight, but it was apparent that she still wasn't happy. The time came that my SO's mother decided to move and she moved further away from us and closer to the other two sisters. We're now approximately 30 minutes away from all of my SO's family, and our relationship has struggled ever since. My SO has essentially given me an ultimatum that we need to move closer to her family again, which means a new school district for the kids. She explained that family is crucially important to her, and that she can't imagine raising a family (we were discussing having another child) this far away from them. It has gotten to the point where she says that she is willing to end the relationship if I am unwilling to move again. Her argument is that our two boys have cousins that would be in the same school system (although none of them are in the same grade) and that we could have more impromptu meetups with her family and they could \"play sports at the same parks together.\"  I understand the importance of the relationships, but my son simply does not have the same deep relationship with her sister's children as my SO's son (obviously). He was older (and had had no other brothers/sisters/cousins) when he met them and has never connected as well as we had hoped.\n\nI absolutely love my SO, but I also have a duty to my son to continue to provide stability. I don't want to rip him out of yet another school especially in middle school when kids can be so horrific. I think moving again would wreak havoc on him and his emotions. Outside of my own feelings towards moving again, I'm not even sure that the court would let me due to the increased distance to my son's mother. I could see her argument if we were hours away from her family, but I can't justify a decrease in 10 or 15 minutes of travel time at the expense of my son's well-being. I'm trying to empathize with my SO, but it's hard to feel like she is putting her own feelings in front of my son.\n\ntl;dr My SO wants to move to be 10-15 minutes closer to her family but it would involve switching my son's school for the third time. My son has already had a tough childhood.",

I don't think I deserve him. \n\nhe has never liked school dances or events. I went to all three of the dances freshmen year, he went to the last one (formal) with me. we went to all of the football games together that we could (kind of like dates, but where I was a flaky bitch). we went to our football season kick off together two years. we rarely go to see school plays (but this one is more on me). \n\nwe both definitely thought we'd go to prom together BUT he has no interest in prom. the whole idea of prom and the plans my close friend, S, and I want to make surrounding prom just stress him out. he feels terribly anxious about it. I honestly don't think I reacted to him being stressed about it well, and I owe him an apology for that. \n\nhowever, when we were fighting about prom, I suggested he shouldn't go and I honestly stand by that. in my ideal prom, yeah, he'd go and he'd have a hell of time, but that's not reality. reality is that he is dreading it, he's not interested, and that he doesn't think he'd enjoy it. he still insists on attending with me though, and says he'll just feel anxious internally, and I don't think he should. I think he should stay home or go to work or do whatever he wants, and I can go to prom. I can go with a friend and I can have fun, while he has his fun. he says this means I don't want to spend time with him, which isn't true. I love him so so much. we try to spend all available time together. I don't want to spend time with him when I know that time is not enjoyable, especially when I know it's because of what I chose for us to do, and knowing that I'm keeping him there. \n\nI don't know. I feel like an asshole and I feel like I'm in the right. I know he went to bed upset at me and that makes me feel worse. I wouldn't mind him going with the friend, T, I'd be going with if he didn't go, but I think I'd be bothered if he went with someone who wasn't T.

I\u2019ve worked here for about 2 years now and I work almost every weekend because that\u2019s when they need the help. Ive been fine with that, requesting time off here and there because I like to go visit family and friends every once in awhile. \n\nSo the problem is that I requested off my 21st birthday this year. I requested it off in February, while my birthday is on March 29th, which is a Friday. Friday\u2019s we tend to be a lot busier than any day of the week. I came into work today to have my boss tell me that I have to work 2-10 on my birthday because he has \u2018no one else\u2019. Just for some more context, we have gone through cooks like crazy. I believe it\u2019s mainly due to my bosses not wanting to pay people more. The only reason I\u2019ve stayed is because it works better for my classes this semester and the full time cook that used to work here quit in November after 10 years, due to wanting a raise and my bosses would not give to him. We have had some good cooks leave because of this reason. \n\nNow I\u2019m pretty frustrated because I hardly take weekends off of work. I maybe request a weekend every two to three months to visit my parents, who live 2 hours away from my college. Otherwise I only have Monday\u2019s and Tuesday\u2019s off of working. I work 10 hour shifts on the weekend.\n\nCurrently, my boss also has two cooks here who work under the table for cash, when he needs them on the weekend. They are not obligated to be here so if they tell him they don\u2019t want to work, I usually get stuck working shifts alone on the weekends. We also have a new cook, but he has no experience prior so it\u2019ll be awhile until he\u2019s all trained in. So my boss relies on me heavily to pick up the slack here. I\u2019m pretty frustrated because for a bar, we have very understaffed in the kitchen and the weekend hours fall on me. I somehow feel \u2018punished\u2019 when I\u2019m unable to get days I request off because he doesn\u2019t hire more people on the actual pay roll. \n\nI want to send my boss a text tomorrow and tell him that I either get this Friday off or Thursday is my last day working here. And that I would like to discuss it in person as well. Would I be the asshole to pretty much threaten quitting if I don\u2019t receive my birthday off? ",

I (29F Linux Engineer) met my wife (36F CFO) when I was 21 (8 years ago). We actually got really serious really fast. I was working several jobs at the time and going to school. My total income was fairly meager even though I did rescue her financially with my savings early on. She earned just north of 100K but was bouncing back from a divorce. As it was, and I dont remember exactly how, but we reached a point in the first year where we were living together full time and she handled all finances. I would deposit my checks and direct deposits into our joint bank account. She would handle all bills and expenses which was fine by me as I'm not the most punctual with money things and previously relied on a habit of over funding my bank account and scheduling things for auto pay that I would check every few months. After rescuing her with over 10K of savings and gifting her a reasonably newish honda accord, I didnt have that luxury any more so decided to trust her with my measly income and appreciated being able to enjoy obviously nicer amenities covered by her lifestyle and income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust over 4 years ago I started my tech career with a 32K entry level job. In less than 3 and a half years I promoted up to a 48K income, then got poached a year ago for a 6 figure salary. January 1 of 2018 I noticed some financial red flags that I had grown immune to or just been blind to out of appreciation for my wife's support. I ended up calling in sick 3 days in a row due to loosing sleep pouring over 6 years of bank and credit card statements and feeling sick from the pattern I was seeing emerge. I felt incredibly naieve and ignorant as I looked at the big picture. My thoughts were also haunted by the reality I'm poor at choosing gifts &amp; observing the gift giving traditions of certain holidays/birthdays and had been made to feel guilty or inadequate in that way on multiple occasions even though I basically had no money to spend on gifts and the ones I did manage to gift I had to strategically siphon money off of odd income sources to save up and get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously she knew what my attention was being consumed by. Once I was done, I personally felt hurt and betrayed by her for the first time in our then 7 year relationship. Knowing things I had done without due to \"budgeting constraints\" and feeling guilty when I did splurge on rare occasions for years, and living in a habitual state of knowing that if I need something mildly pricey I'd end up asking a month or two in a row and maybe being able to spend on it 3 months down the road ( not the way I had lived prior to joining our finances when I had over 10K in savings and always felt secure I could cover unexpected financial emergencies etc ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course we talked about how I was feeling, the pattern I was seeing, she admitted she is great at execution when someone else is making the financial decisions but is poor at self restraint when it comes to her making spending choices. We talked about how to change things going forward and agreed that it makes sense to split our finances, then work jointly to cover costs that make sense to split. Beginning of February she asked for 2 months before handing over my income so she could make a smooth transition and not leave anything falling through the cracks. With a light at the end of the tunnel and a plan in place I agreed without concern to those terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we're at the end of the year, I have enjoyed very little change in my/our life since doubling my income the last year, our checking still ends up at a 0 balance every month with a couple of cards maintaining a revolving 3-9K/mo credit card payoff, and each month she has asked to postpone one pay check again and again (I am paid monthly). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just applied for a bank account &amp; credit card so I can move my direct deposit over starting in January 2019 and begin building my personal credit history since I basically have none but I'm basically setting all this up behind her back and I'm going to tell her once this months paycheck hits our joint account that as of the January pay period I am taking back my income. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFactually I know in my head I'm not wrong to do this but I'm feeling guilty and like its an ass hole move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

My mother is always expecting me to clean up the piles of messes around the house like it\u2019s specifically just me who\u2019s doing it and it\u2019s starting to really get on my nerves. Her argument is that it doesn\u2019t matter if I made the majority of it  were all using the same spaces so we should all work to maintain it.

This dog was never potty trained, and my mother hasn\u2019t really taken any real effort into doing it. \n\nHer idea of training is just throwing random puppy pads around the house even though the dog has already marked several areas, and continues to just pee on furniture and the bathroom floor. \nI\u2019ve begged her to train the dog or enroll him in some form of classes because the dog bites me and has and continues to  destroyed a lot of my personal items and clothing.  \n\nEvery time I bring up her lack of training and how generally disgusting this all is she acts like I\u2019m being a complete asshole. She told me that I should pay for training since she can\u2019t, and if I\u2019m going to continue to complain then I should take the effort. I told her this is unfair to everyone else in the house and if she can\u2019t be bothered to properly train the dog that we\u2019ve had for over a year she\u2019s should give it away to someone else who\u2019s actually willing too.\n\nBecause of this I\u2019ve just become depressed and passive aggressive.

We were very close and saw each other often. She was my best friend. After she moved I visited her as often as I could- 2 or 3 times per year. Things were still good, we texted and called on a regular basis. 2 years ago we started drifting apart due to what I believe is postpartum depression on her end.  I would call and text, but her replies were few and far between.  In that time I was only able to visit once. She never once in 4 years made the trip to see me.  She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to wish me a happy birthday on Facebook. Despite all this, I still considered us close.\n\nNow for the real story:  4 months ago my sister was in town for her husband\u2019s grandmother\u2019s funeral. I just so happened to text her while they were driving in and she told me they were on their way. We texted back and forth a little bit catching up and I asked if she could text me if she got any free time so we could meet up for breakfast or whatever. I told her I would love to see her and her family since it had been a long time. She said she would and I left it at that. The end of the weekend rolled around and I still had not heard from her so I decided to send another text asking what she was up to/ if we could meet up. I am on her way out of town and I was willing to meet her anywhere she wanted. This was her response: \u201cHey Sis, we are headed back already. Sorry.\u201d \u201cThis has been the hardest trip ever; we cried nonstop, we\u2019re completely emotionally worn out.\u201d  I said \u201cOK, but I\u2019m pretty upset. I haven\u2019t seen you or my niece or nephew in over a year.\u201d In her next text to me she completely flipped out and went on about how the grandmother was the matriarch of their family and everyone was devastated and they only had time for her husband\u2019s family etc.  I never responded to that text. I wasn\u2019t sure how to properly convey my hurt feelings without sounding like a jerk so I left it alone. I am not in any way trying to dismiss her loss or not be understanding, but I didn't think I was asking for much. \n\nAll I was asking for was an hour of her time during her 3 day stay. Shortly after this exchange, 2 weeks or so, she and her husband (and his family!) completely blocked me and my whole family (Our mom, dad, my husband, Aunts etc) from social media with no explanation or anything.  When I texted her to ask why I never got a response. I\u2019m devastated that I won\u2019t get to see my niece and nephew grow up or have a good relationship with my sister again.  Am I the asshole for asking her to spare an hour to visit me while she was in town for a funeral and then being kind of mad when she didn\u2019t? ",

At this time his house turned out to have some pretty serious issues with the roof. They\u2019ve been having leaks and need over ten thousand dollars to have it entirely redone. This, on top of supporting a kid in college, is tough.\n\nHe voiced his concerns in the group, and those who could pitched in. I had some money left over, so I donated 40 bucks. A pittance, but I\u2019m not officially employed, and when I do make money, it\u2019s far below minimum wage because it\u2019s not an actual job. All of us working together barely got over 100$, but we apologized for not being able to help out more. \n\nNot even a few days later, he\u2019s in the group chat bragging about a new gaming laptop his grandparents just gave him. The thing costed over a thousand dollars, brand new, and he wasn\u2019t shy on showing it off and telling everyone about what it could run. I was a little hurt and confused when I heard this. Turns out his grandparents aren\u2019t on the best terms with his parents, and so they didn\u2019t chip in for the house redos. I understood that.\n\nBut what I didn\u2019t get at all is why he didn\u2019t sell the laptop and buy a cheaper work one, adding perhaps 700-800$ to the family funds to pay for the roof so that they wouldn\u2019t have to go online to ask for donations. The grandparents would understand because they adore him, and why not use this as an opportunity to convince them to help them as a favor to their grandson, who has to live in the house?\n\nHe also has both PS and Xbox gaming consoles, alongside a dedicated gaming pc and now this new gaming laptop, as I later found out, which just adds to my confusion.

I would never say these to his face, but I feel guilty for thinking these thoughts.\n\n\nTL;DR Guy who needs money got my donation, has expensive gaming equipment lying around, isn\u2019t contributing to family funds.

My brother had an episode and ended up getting into some trouble and getting hospitalized. My mother said to me, \"I just don't know anyone who is bipolar!\" I was floored. I told at her how I was bipolar, too, and she knew that and I had been diagnosed several times and attempted suicide several times. When she found out about my first suicide attempt she yelled and screamed at me. She offered no advice or comfort.\n\nWhen we would talk on the phone the conversations were always one-sided. Every time I would try to say something she would interrupt me. It got to the point where I would just stop what I saying and stay silent for most of the conversation.\n\nWhen I would get to together with my siblings we would complain about her and her antics. She was once staying the weekend at my sister's to babysit her kids and she re-arranged the entire the kitchen just because she didn't like how it was. My sister and her husband her pissed!\n\nIn high school I wanted to walk to school instead of her driving me. This led to a fist fight. She was always quick to hitting us when we were growing up.\n\nSo I got really sick in 2013 with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. I suffered from chronic pain and couldn't do a lot for myself for a few years. She had helped me out a lot during that time, staying with me and caring for me when I needed her to. She was retired so she had the time to do so. It was a really rough time for me - lots of doctors, lots of procedures, lots of medicines - nothing was helping my pain. I could do nothing that was fun anymore.\n\nSo in 2014 I had called her about something and said something about being in pain. She screamed at me on the phone \"I am so sick and tired of hearing about your pain!\" I was so upset. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Everything that had happened in our relationship had come back in that instant and I yelled back \"You will never have to hear about my fucking pain again!\" and hung up on her. I haven't spoke to her since. I blocked her on social media. I blocked her from calling or texting me. She can still email, though. She never apologized to me directly, but I have heard through my siblings that she feels bad about it and she tells them she is sorry. The thing is, she didn't talk to her own mother for 14 years as she was toxic. I feel like turn about is fair play.

            "input": "So I work at a local news station and if you have no experience or knowledge of how the production side works all of our team has headphones with a mic on it so we can communicate to each other. The main purpose is to listen to the commands of the technical director, but as well as the Producer just in case he/she changes something in the show, which happens often. \n\nDuring the week I run the graphics of the show and video/packages and for the whole team it's KEY to listen to the director because he/she is telling us when what and where to run things. We also all chat during the show mostly during commercial but also sometimes during the show depending on the story, but we try to keep this to a minimal. \n\nHere's my issue: we have two producers, but one of them is super loud and doesn't stop talking. He/she was just moved to our show (I work mornings and he/she used to work nights) but everyone from night said he/she never shuts up. I have Thursday and Friday off and I play fortnite with some of the team and last Thursday our director said our Executive Producer came to drop some scrips but also said \"I am going to talk to ***** he/she needs to shut the fuck up.\" Well nothing has changed. Our director has a really low voice (he admits it), so I have to raise the volume of the headphones but it's still at reasonable Volume (12 of clock on the nob). It really hurts my ear when he/she gets into a conversation and raises his/her voice. I literally take my headphones off but I can only do it for a couple seconds cuz if not it's gonna affect to show. \n\nHe/she acknowledge it once when we were talking about something and I had to remove my headphones cuz it hurts and I told her \"Sometimes you kinda scream when you get into a conversation and it hurts and it's not necessary.\" She wasn't rude in her response but you could tell she was defensive when she says \"I don't scream.\" And I apologized and was \"I just meant you can be loud.\" She responded again in a defensive tone \"I don't talk loud. I project. I use my diaphragm, they teach you that in theater. \" I just turned around and rolled my eyes. In my head I was like \"bitch this ain't theater. We have mics for a reason, you don't have to project.\" To be real, he/she IS loud. \n\nI'm conflicted, cuz I hate when people go to a supervisor when it could be fixed by talking with the person directly. Also, the team also agrees with me that he/she is too loud but they are too nice and nonconfrontational. I also ask myself if I'm part of me wants to just go to the Executive Producer cuz I'm supper annoyed about this person but this person has a bit of history of being somewhat unreasonably stubborn. \n\nI have no issue with confrontation. I love debating and have no issue arguing but I don't want this person to have something against me. I don't want any awkwardness. \n\nSo AITA here for not talking to her a second time? ",

We used to hookup but we stopped about 3 years ago. Lisa HATES Anna. She thinks that Anna acts inappropriately toward me and she\u2019s not totally wrong but I think it\u2019s unfair of Lisa to try to control my friendships.

There\u2019s several reasons why but I\u2019ll give the big reason why. \n\nWhen we started dating he had a best friend who was always around him. She bought him things, made him food, texted goodnight/good morning I love you everyday, ate lunch with just the two of them everyday etc. I tried to not question it because I just assumed they were really good friends, and he even told me that multiple occasions. Saying she\u2019s just a giving and friendly person. \n\nWell months go by and I discovered nudes on his phone from her, and text messages saying he felt something for her. Well I confronted him and he only confessed to the things he thought I knew. I asked if he had sex with her and he said no.  I even asked if he\u2019s cheated before and he said he\u2019d never do that. He then blocked her off everything. \n\nMonths later i felt something wasn\u2019t right. I was a little drunk and told him he is lying to me. I berate him until he told me a truth. And then that\u2019s when he confessed that he had sex with her in the past. We had a long talk and towards the end \u201cif there\u2019s anything else you should tell me nows the time\u201d. And I always do this, I always beg for honesty and have always asked him for the truth. And then he says no. Everything is off his chest. \nI text her the next morning saying I knew (because he even had her lie to me saying they never did) we had a long talk, then I told both of them I forgive them. \n\nThe next day she told his ex that they had an affair while he was with his ex. They slept together several times while he was dating his ex. I was devastated again. First, he lies about sleeping with her. Next, I found out he cheated on his ex with the same girl and he didn\u2019t even confess it to me. The ex was the one that delivered the news. \n\nMy trust issues blew through the roof. \n\nNowadays if something is bothering me I want to ask him about it because I really regretted not asking enough in the past.  If I don\u2019t trust him I tell him I don\u2019t. He\u2019s really open to communicate that kind of stuff now. \n\nWell today something just struck a nerve and I called him out on checking girls out on Instagram. He told me that that accusation made him really sick. He got mad at me and told me that that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing. But I know he\u2019s doing that because he checks up on the same girls every time he goes on Instagram. But he just told me that \u201cwhy would I ever do that, I already put you through so much\u201d thing. And that I need to stop. I felt like my anger was really valid, because he accuses me of the same things. \n\nI don\u2019t know. Things like that really annoy me and I always kinda feel a little inkling that he\u2019s always looking at other girls or that he\u2019s treating me wrongly behind my back. I want to be a good girlfriend with no trust issues but whenever I feel somethings not right I have to tell him instead of bottling it up. I just can\u2019t hold it in anymore. But he wants me to atleast try trusting him but I do try! It\u2019s just giving me a hard time right now. \n\n\nAITA??",

After a while, like a year ish, though I figured he seemed chill enough. My boyfriend and I were flirty with eachother and liked eachother, but we were not together. \n\nAfter another 6 ish months he was kind of acting off and distant so I gave C some space and we weren\u2019t talking very frequently. That\u2019s when his best friend started hitting on me, asking for nudes, all the likes. At the time I was feeling kind of lonely so I said fuck it and did it and talked with him, and then he ghosted me. I was kind of surprised since I had thought he was a nice guy. \n\nSo I told C what had happened and he said something like \u201cHaha oh yea B does that kind of stuff all the time, to girls he finds everywhere\u201d So I was kind of upset and asked C why he didn\u2019t tell me B did that kind of stuff and if he could talk to him about it.

He made up an impossible budget and wouldn't give me access to a shared bank account so I had to use up my savings for basics like food and diapers.\n\n \n\n I finally got a job a some months ago.

VERY stable and healthy relationship (imagine at worst a cold shoulder followed by hugs in a few hours, never any \u201cfights\u201d only discussions). Both in our mid-20s. My parents left on a trip for the first time since i was born. He is one of the main caretakers of his grandpa who had an accident about a month ago. We had been discussing me spending a night with him for a couple of weeks but we never set a date. We decided today with my parents being gone and him not working in the morning (very unusual) that I\u2019d spend the night after a taco dinner at his house. At 7pm I had a dinner/galentines. I said I wouldn\u2019t be eating because he and I planned to eat together afterwards. His barber also rescheduled and he had to be there at 7:30 am tomorrow, but this was new info since he was supposed to have that haircut today after work. \n\n\n\n\nThe situation:\n\nAfter work I HAD to drop off packages at the post office but I got there at 5:55 and they chose to close early today. Of course they did. The post is about 10-15 minutes from my house but I ended up spending a nearly hour drive back to my house to get ready for galentines because traffic was terrible. I arrived, got ready, and headed out again close to 7pm. I drove 20 miles to the late night post office, but that took about another hour of traffic. \n\nAt around 8pm I called him anxious and stressed because I was so late and still had to pick up chips before arriving. He was supportive, gave me advice that worked to calm me down, and we talked about me going over later and how great it would be to snuggle all night (we essentially lived together our first year but I moved back in with my parents after uni) \n\nWe hung up around 8:40ish when I arrived. None of our plans had changed. I didn\u2019t eat dinner, but I stayed for gift exchanges and to play one game. Our texts went like this: \n\n\n*less than an hour after I arrived*\nHim (H): I have to be up early to go to the Berber shop. Oh that\u2019s fun! Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t come over babe enjoy your night It\u2019s nice that you are having girl time. We can see each other tomorrow \n\nMe (M): Can I call (sibling) after to see if he's home so I can go sleep with you? \n\nH: If you want to baby but I don\u2019t want you to be rushing around for no reason \n\nM: No but it isn't rushing :) I wanted to see you so much. I'll head over when this game is done? \n\nH: Don\u2019t you want to spend more time with them? Don\u2019t call it early if you don\u2019t have to \n\nM: I want to go with you... \n\n*about 2 hours after I arrived*\nH: How are you?? *insert really sweet cheesy memory from when we first started dating*\n\nMe: awww bae. I\u2019m about to go over.\n\n\n\nOBVIOUSLY hindsight is 20/20 and I didn\u2019t notice he wasn\u2019t just being nice and making sure I didn\u2019t leave a fun event if I didn\u2019t have to, he was lowkey hinting that it was too late for me to go over. I genuinely thought he just didn\u2019t want to inconvenience me, but I had no problem going to bed right after getting there and waking up early with him for the haircut. \n\nHe had good intentions, he didn\u2019t outright tell me not to go because he didn\u2019t want me to feel rejected, BUT I DIDNT GET THE HINT AT ALL. So what\u2019d I do?\n\nI left the place with an excuse, called him in the car and he seemed ambiguous about the time and me going over. I was confused but immediately noticed his wishy washiness so I asked again if he wanted me to spend the night. \n\nHe said if I want to.\n\nI said, NO I\u2019m not spending the night unless you\u2019re okay with it, your family is okay with it, and you explicitly want me to go over. If you don\u2019t want me to, just let me know so I can drive to my house (opposite highways.) \n\nA similar conversation ensued where he kept insisting I could go if I wanted to but he also mentioned the time, how he was going to sleep as soon as his shower was done, what time he had to wake up, etc and all the reasons it was inconvenient. \n\nI almost begged him to just tell me yes or no because I was driving and I already took the highway to his house. He never gave me a solid answer. I just said I would be going home. \n\nOn the way home, I called my brother and I vented that I was upset because I was hungry (waiting to eat with him), not going to get to spend the night I was looking forward to, and I could have just stayed playing games with friends for longer. \n\nIn the process, I went to (ALMOST TO THE SAME AREA AS THE PARTY I JUST LEFT, about another half hour of traffic from an accident!) pick up food since I was starving.\n\nHe called before bed and we talked but I was obviously bothered. When I started saying what bothered me, I definitely spoke purely in an emotional whiny tone, I began to cry, and I said I was so frustrated from the whole situation. I cited not having eaten, him not being clear on whether our plans were cancelled or not, and the general disappointment of not being able to see him. I mentioned how annoyed and sad I was that not only would I not spend the night with him but I could have at least eaten with and stayed around my friends longer. \n\nHe said that it was nearly 11 when I left (he is right) and that he did mention that I should stay with my friends longer if I wanted to. He also said that if I went over I wouldn\u2019t have eaten anyways since he assumed I ate something from how much later things dragged on.\n\nI said I didn\u2019t care about the food though, it\u2019s just a variable. I said that if I got there, didn\u2019t eat, we went to bed and woke up early I would have been perfectly content because all I wanted was to spend time together. Being hungry after NOT seeing him is just worst.\n\nI was very emotional talking about it and I usually don\u2019t get like that. I almost begged him to just tell me not to go over. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you thought it was too late and didn\u2019t want me to go, just PLEASE tell me. I took the wrong highway, I made an excuse to leave early, I didn\u2019t eat food, I just wish you said you didn\u2019t want me to go from the beginning.\u201d \n\nI feel crappy because I didn\u2019t make sure he knew that I was aware that he tried to spare my feelings and guide me to what he was implying, but I was just too upset at all the wasted time that I forgot to say it.\n\n\nAfter he said those statements, he heard me continue to emotionally cry and vent, he apologized and said he would keep it in mind for the future and try for it to not happen again. He also asked if I\u2019d like him to pick me up in the morning to run errands together and hang out. I agreed. I didn\u2019t even want him to apologize. I was just sad and wanted to see him. \n\nWe ended with sending sweet texts apologizing and saying how much we can\u2019t wait to see each other tomorrow morning. The entire thing from leaving the place to my rant ending was about 30-40 minutes. Then we were fine by the time we got off the phone. \n\nBut i keep thinking about my reactions and I feel like such an asshole. I know he did it to spare my feelings and with good intentions. \n\nAm I the asshole for reacting that way to him not explicitly saying not go over?\n\nTLDR: sleep overplans with bf got cancelled because it was late but he didn\u2019t tell me explicitly only implied it. I ended up hungry, bored, and lonely so I emotionally cry-bitched at him over the phone even though I knew he had good intentions. Am i the asshole for how I reacted to him beating around the bush?",

She wasn't in much physical pain, but she was certainly limited in what she could and couldn't do. My Dad visited her everyday. This started after I went to college also hours away. When I'd visit, I'd offer to go see Grandma and help out so Dad could take a break. Dad insisted I go there with him and \"just visit with Grandma\". I did. This continued even after I moved back in with them to recover from an extensive surgery. When I could drive again, I took Grandma to a few errands locally and occasionally to lunch. Dad still attended her doctors appointments. My mother (to whom he's still married and lives with) would also volunteer to help Grandma out. I'm told she would plan to take Grandma to the doctors on days she was off work, but Dad took a day off anyway and insisted only he and Grandma go. This was the pattern for a few years.\n\nOne day, I had to be in my Aunt Cheryl's town and she and I spent some together. We talked about Grandma and she confirmed what I had always suspected. She had offered to come and visit a few times, but Dad insisted she stay home with her family. He said he could take on the bulk of it because his only child (me) was out of the house. When Grandma was feeling up to traveling she'd stay with them once a week every so often. Her kids would still need her. I know that all of her kids would call at least once a day and usually would video chat as well.\n\nSo this summer. Grandma passed. It was sad for us all. All of her children were with her at her deathbed and she saw them all during her final days in which she was conscious. At her funeral, my half-sister (maternal) left in the middle. Out (maternal) aunt \"Heidi\" was watching her infant son and she was going back so Heidi could attend the funeral. I went with her to Heidi's house so we could stop on the way and get something from my parents house.\n\nI should preface this by saying that Heidi and I have had problems for a while now. Heidi is white trash and a complete asshole. She bosses my mother around and is an all around unpleasant person. I wish my sister wouldn't use her for childcare, but I'm told the arrangement will end soon. Anyway, as Heidi, her husband and I were on our way back I told her how the funeral was going who was there... Heidi made the gem of a comment \"If only her kids cared enough to see her while she was alive\" she also called them \"vultures\" for going through Grandma's jewelry too soon. I wanted to spit in her face, but we were arriving to the funeral so I held it in.\n\nAfterwards I told my mother that I want nothing to do with Heidi until she apologizes. Heidi has done some shitty things in her life, but to insult my grandmothers children at her funeral (or on the way, for a point at me being the asshole, we were in her car in the road and no one else would hear) is my limit. Unless Heidi apologizes, she's out of my life. I told Mom that if I see Heidi when I go to visit I don't care what time it is or what the weather, I'm getting my things, getting in my car and driving home. The holidays are coming and I'm reiterating to my mother, I don't care if it's my nephews first holiday season, I see Heidi, I'm out. My mom has always kowtowed to her siblings and I know this is causing her stress. She's insisting that Heidi was kind to my Grandma in life and spent time with her while she was sick. I've told my sister this as well, my sister made similar disgusting comments. I've told her off. I'm giving my sister leeway due to stress from raising a baby. I intend to keep up on my promise. I haven't told my Dad what Heidi said or my ultimatum.\n\ntl;dr: \n\n- Aunt insulted my grandmothers children on her way to her funeral\n- Aunt and grandmother are on different branches of the family and unrelated\n- My mother insists that my aunt spent time with Grandma while she was sick and they were friendly while Grandma was alive\n- The insult was uncalled for and blaming them for making choices in a hard time\n- If I see Heidi while vising my parents I'm leaving\n- My mother won't acknowledge what Heidi said was wrong and is stressed that I'm causing a rift\n\nI feel it necessary to close by saying, I will never be violent with Heidi. She isn't worth jail time. I may insult her loudly but overall I jsut want to never see her again.",

But this recently happened and I need to know if I am the one in the wrong!  \n\nI recently started going to a new gym that is super close to my house and started making some friends - keeps me motivated! Less then a week ago a random guy came up to me and was sparking up a conversation, I didn't think anything of it and tossed him my number. (Important to note I am a 6pm gym goer and pretty much eat / go straight to bed after) Once I was done, I went home - ate and passed out, when I woke up I had 7 missed messages from this guy! \n\nLets call him T, they consisted of him (M26) explaining he's a nerd, was bullied in school and never approaches girls then how I must be \"one of those\" that just ghost people and got his hopes up. I didn't respond since it was kind of creepy and weird, also rude!  \n\nNEXT DAY\n\nIm at the gym doing my thing and notice he sat at the leg press next to me, I smile &amp; nod and just keep doing my workout. He then PULLS MY HEADPHONE OUT and told me I could have the decency to acknowledge him. I told him that it was weird and uncalled for with all the messages, however I picked up my pride and apologized for not letting him know I went to bed. FLASH FORWARD to that night, he spams me - again. This time with sexual messages about my body. Now Im creeped out, because its not just compliments - its lengthy detailed fantasies, I never respond and block him.  \n\nNEXT DAY\n\nHe follows me around the gym, not saying anything but always standing a good couple feet behind me. I waved and acknowledged him but he never said anything. Weird. \n\nTHIS IS WHEN SHIT GETS CREEPY - Two girls come up behind me and let me know hes been taking snapchat videos of me, and they saw him doing it. They explain he was creeping on them not more than a month ago and told the front desk. \n\nWe all decided to go report him to the gym and they take action to ban him for harassment.... where we in the wrong? took it too far? I feel odly bad because he was bullied but THIS IS CREEPY, right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Well, as the movie started playing three guys walked in but its whatever they're sitting towards the front and there's still 15 empty rows between us. 10 minutes into the movie though one of the guys gets up and starts walking up the stairs and sits to the right of my gf who is to the right of me. This itself wasn't a problem because I saw the trolling humor in sitting next to two high schoolers in a theater to ruin their back row privacy but what was a problem was his stench... Even walking up the stairs I could tell his long hair was super greasy and unkempt and when he sat down it smelled like he just hopped out of a bath of rotten eggs and put on his dead whale deodorant after getting off a 12 hour shift of shoveling cow shit. I visibly gagged at the first whiff and he was even one seat away from me leaving my poor gf to take the full brunt. 15 minutes pass and its become completely unbearable. My gf leans over and asks if we can leave which I quickly agree with. As we stood up to leave we had to walk past him and being 16 and thoroughly annoyed at this point I thought the only logical thing to do was take the lid off our large soda and dump it on him as we walked by. Saying he was pissed would be an understatement but I didn't care and told him \"Maybe this will finally get you to take a shower\" and walked out with him fuming and his friends laughing. My gf thought it was a little unnecessary but wasn't mad about it either and years later I reflect on that night and wonder AITA?",

So this is the story:\n\nMy first boyfriend and I were together for 4 years. Towards the end (the last year, maybe a little longer), he became *very* abusive. Not physically, but emotionally and mentally, and even academically. I became really depressed and had to go on medication for anxiety. I cried all the time. He threatened me if I didn\u2019t have sex with him, try and \u201cpunish\u201d me by taking things away, like planned trips, etc. His narcissism grew stronger. He didn\u2019t care about my needs, my feelings, my opinions... However, prior to all of this, I spoiled the ever loving shit out of him. I wanted him to be happy. I got him so many concert tickets, VIP\u2019s, merchandise... swamped him gifts for special occasions. Etc. Towards the end I feel like he was partially using me for my money. \n\nANYWAY. Eventually we break up for good. I felt so relieved. But 3 months later he messages me with huge apologies and how he made a mistake. Begged for another chance. I kept saying no. But this time... I kinda thought of an idea to get back at him for all the pain he caused me. \n\nHe asked to meet up for dinner just to talk. We\u2019d pay for our own things. I agree to it. I purposely leave my wallet at home, make it sound like a mistake. I pretend to realize this after the check comes. He\u2019s annoyed, but he pays. Then, we\u2019re in his car. We start making out and after a while he\u2019s all hot and bothered. After it\u2019s obvious that he thinks he\u2019s going to score, I pull away and tell him that I want to go home. I made it sound like I thought it was a bad idea, but I actually planned to do this. He was angry. Drove me home. \n\nI thought this would finally make him leave me alone.

I work on a team with my best friend (Jay), and my boyfriend (Dee), how could it get any better right? Jay has been a close friend for about 6 years and I have been seriously dating Dee for 9 months now.\n\nWe drive to 6 accounts on Thursdays, since my car has been down a little over a month now, Dee has been picking us (Jay and I) up from our house. Obviously Jay and I live together and Dee lives about 20mins away from us. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting, my boyfriend has a decent car, the outside could use some TLC but the interior is immaculate. Dee is a genius when it comes to wiring, so as well as having an awesome sound system he also has the video display up front and we can watch movies on the way to our accounts. \n\nJay has been struggling a bit with his alcoholism, he doesn't always drink on the job but occasionally he does, I dont judge as long as you get your work done, keep the liquor out of the accounts, and of course dont break anything. He has worked the better part of the last 6 months with no issues so I had no issue. \n\nThis day though I could see signs that he had a little too much, and I told him, you're cut off from this point. He wasn't happy but obliged, or so I thought. \n\nJay asked my boyfriend for his car keys so he could fetch a cleaner we forgot to grab from the car, goes outside and is unseen for 10 minutes, I go out and he is still in the car looking for the cleaner... it was on the floor where we told him it was. In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. \n\nFast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. \nAt this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. \n\nDee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. \n\nFast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are \"childish\" and \"petty\". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. \n\nWhen Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.\n\nNow I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. \n\nOk then.\n\nOn Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. \n\nUnfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.\n\nThe whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...\n\nThis is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. \n\nThen I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...\n\nI asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. \n\nI'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.\n",

Other than my family and a few close friends, nobody really knows and I prefer it that way.  I also have absolutely no idea where this money is coming from to plan a wedding, because we don't have it. \n\nRight now, the plan is to have a wedding in about a year. I have always wanted a longer engagement (2-5 years). I would much prefer to have a wedding after school is done (about 2-3 years). I haven't pushed to change the plan yet but I am EXTREMELY overwhelmed and worry I will either need to quit grad school, or postpone the wedding and I think it is most appropriate to postpone the wedding. I don't even want to get married that quickly, and think it's a little rushed. \n\nI've asked my parents and they are also pushing for the wedding to be sooner so fiance's dad can be there but I cannot imagine what kind of basket case I will be in a year because school isn't going to get easier. At this point, it's already distracting me and I'm falling behind in classes. \n\nIn summary, I would prefer to postpone the wedding until after grad school. Am I the asshole? I kind of think so.

I'm currently enrolled in entomology and hope to go to grad school for it. The collection required me to kill and pin insects, and she kept telling me how cruel it is, their blood is on my hands (never mind the fact insects have hemolymph, not blood, which I wanted to tell her but did not because I figured it wouldn't help), etc etc. as if I enjoyed the action of having to kill 40+ insects to display their dead bodies.

Chuckled in my head thinking there was no way he could be doing it again. Nah. No way.\n\nHe\u2019s fucking doing it again. \nThis time, I don\u2019t get up. The professor was already hovering in the vicinity. All it took this time was dead eye contact between myself and the professor, followed by a swift eye jerk in the direction of the cheater. Professor stormed down our aisle, demanded the dudes papers. Could feel the guy practically shit himself. Hesitantly follows the order and finally gets dragged out of the class.\n\nIn my uni, the honor code states that punishment can range from a failing grade on that exam or being failed for the whole class. It can even, on request of the professor, be taken to the honors council where they can make an even more serious decision of removing said person from certain university programs or even the university itself. Honestly, the professor seemed fucking fumed about it, so I don\u2019t know to what extent he took it.\n\nLooking back at it now, part of me realizes that this wasn\u2019t high school; a days detention and a smack on the wrist was not all this guy was gonna get. But at the time I was PISSED, being someone who actually worked for the good grade just to have someone who did nothing to blow through the class was entirely.\n\nBut, I snitched. That\u2019s the basic offense against me but really, Am I the Asshole?\n\n\nTL;DR I got some dude next to me busted for cheating and his consequences were probably really bad",

            "input": "Okay so I\u2019ve been living with these two friends of mine for about 3 months and we\u2019ve had only a few issues but one of the main ones is parking.\n\nParking in our appartment complex is absolutely terrible. Every unit (except maybe one bedroom units?) Is allowed 3 parking spots. One covered and marked right by the stairway to your appartment, another compact spot off to the side, and your third spot is any spot marked visitor. \n\nI am responsible for every bill we pay, except rent which we each pay individually to our landlord. They obviously pay me their third of the bills at the end of the month, but it\u2019s on me to have money in my account until then to make sure all the bills are paid and we don\u2019t have any issues. Since I\u2019m burdened with this, along with the fact that I drive the biggest car and I won\u2019t fit in the compact spot, I suggested I be allowed the covered marked spot. They didn\u2019t like that idea.\n\nWe ran through lots of ideas to solve the parking problem and roommate 1 suggested we just do first one home gets the covered marked spot if they want it. Of course I\u2019m okay with this since I\u2019m the first one off work everyday. Both roommate 2 and I agreed.\n\nAfter a few days of this roommate 1 was out late and came back to no available parking so he had to park away from the apartments. He\u2019s told me two separate stories so I feel like it\u2019s all a big lie, but he told me first that he got a ticket because he was illegally parked and then he told me he parked a few blocks away at the grocery store. No sure which is true, or if either are true honestly. \n\nSo because of this roommate 1 demanded a new parking rule so that never happened again. He said what we should do is first person home takes a visitor spot, second person takes the compact, and third gets the covered spot. This makes sense to me so I reluctantly agreed. \n\nThings were fine for a few weeks until one day I came home to limited parking available. As usually roommate 2 is in the marked compact spot, but roommate one was in visitor parking. I thought okay so I\u2019ll just take the marked spot but it was taken by a car I\u2019d never seen before. I parked all the way at the other end of the complex and furiously stormed in complaining that someone took our spot. It turns out that roommate 1 let his girlfriend take the covered spot and she was here for almost 2 whole days without moving. \n\nI let the last incident slide and for a few more weeks it was okay. I was getting good visitor spots, roommate 2 was still taking the compact spot and roommate 1 usually being the last one home would take the covered spot. I started realizing that roommate 1 was just taking the covered spot and not even following his own rules of parking visitor if he was home before us. This all came to a head when one weekend he went out of town and left his car in the covered spot the whole time. It really fucked me over 2 of those nights. I confronted him about it and he seemed unconcerned by my complaining. \n\nSo once again we made a new rule. There are 4 convenient visitors spots that I can take that are near our entrance. If they are available I will take them. If not I\u2019m taking the covered spot. Roommate 2 still takes the compact spot which both roommate 1 and I don\u2019t really have any issue with. \n\nThis rule worked well for a little bit, but Monday-Wednesday this week people have stayed parked in those good visitor spots. So I took the covered spot those days, as the allowed by the rules. Wednesday roommate 1 texts me and says that I keep taking the cover spot and he needs it. I told him no if you\u2019re not here and there aren\u2019t any good visitor spots then I\u2019m taking that spot. He tried to tell me that he wants to go back to the old rule of first one here takes visitor and next takes covered. I called him out saying that I rarely if ever saw him taking a visitor spot and leaving the covered space for me. I\u2019m going to paste what he said to me next here. \u201cYou\u2019re right bro I\u2019m wrong. You\u2019re just being really selfish and inconsiderate. You\u2019ve never had to park at the store before\u201d. That pissed me off that he said I\u2019m inconsiderate because he was out late one night and didn\u2019t get a spot when he never ever went out of his way to leave me a spot. \n\nSo yeah I mean it\u2019s only been a day since that happened but I\u2019ve been taking the good open visitor spots. I don\u2019t know what the solution is here, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here to find out if I\u2019m being an ass hole for doing this. Sorry for the long post! But thanks for taking the time!\n\nTL;DR: Roommate and I fight over a parking spot all the time. He wants me to take inconvenient visitor spots while he takes the covered spot simply because he likes to stay out late and doesn\u2019t want to come back to no parking. \n\n",

            "input": "A lot of backstory, but I feel it#s necessary.  \n\n\nMy GF and me have been a couple for some years now but we have never lived together for more than one or two months as we study in different cities. She has an eating disorder in that she is extremely picky about her food and afraid of eating things she hasn't eaten before. The basics are fine (potatoes in all forms, rice, noodles, pizza), there are a few vegetables that are fine and very few forms meat (sausages, salami). In terms of sauces really there's only ketchup, for potatoes, rice, noodles, self-made pizza, you name it.  \n\n\nEspecially for warm meals this is a problem since there's barely enough meals that she eats and I see as a full meal to fill a whole week. When she's on her own she eats something like toast with fried eggs which to me is not a full meal but at best a snack. So when we are together usually I cook for myself and make some extra potatoes for her which she will eat with ketchup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really like cooking but I live on my own and often can't motivate myself to cook for me alone. So it already bothers me we can't cook together (since she also has a problem with touching or smelling a lot of food). Also this is really annoying when we are not at home since I'll always have to limit myself to some place that offers something she eats. When going to any restaurant we need to make sure it has salami pizza, otherwise she won't come as she has nothing to eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow she is very secretive about this and doesn't tell other people. Her parents and siblings know of course, but not even her aunts/uncels or her grandma (at least not \"officially\", I don't know how far they are actually aware). Even for the first 6 months that we were together I had no clue about it. Only when she really could not escape it she began to tell me but it took another 6 months or so until she told me about the extent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe knows this bothers me, she sees why and agrees she wants to change it since it is very unpleasant for her as well and complicates a lot of social situation where she'd for example meet friends. She'd often rather not meet up with them or join later than having to eat with them. There was some progress in the last couple of years (she doesn't mind other food touching hers as much anymore, there's some food she now eats regularly which she hasn't eaten before, she feels less anxiety when trying certain new stuff etc), but still nowhere close a healthy behaviour or diet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I get something to eat I'd ask her if she wanted some, but 99% of the time she'd decline. I'm a bit bummed every time again but I understand that pressuring her won't do any good, so I leave it at that. At times tho it might happen tho that I ask her beforehand if trying some meal was fine for her and when she agrees I usually insist on her eating it. But sometimes once I'm/we're done cooking she'd change her mind and get mad at me when I point out she agreed to try it beforehand, accusing me of pressuring her too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she is studying now and no longer lives with her parents she gets to meet friends more regularly as they also live closer by now. One particular friend she meets a lot and I know he also enjoys cooking a lot. The first thing that bothers me is that she had less of an issue telling him about her eating disorder. But I assume this may be because now that they meet often they get into such situations more often, giving her less room to keep it secret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat really got me recently was that he invited her for dinner for a meal I know she has never eaten before and which I even made myself before multiple times and offered her, but she declined every time. However when he invited her she accepted and ate with him without any big issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after she told me I asked her what the difference was between me and him offering her dinner (as she could have just as easily declined his invitation). She could not find any reason and to be honest this annoys me. I can't even put into words why exactly this bugs me so much. I guess it is that I feel she has a lot more trust (?) in him with this. On one hand I am of course happy for her overcoming this issue a bit more but I feel really unrespected (for a lack of a better term), that what I try to help her with actively for several years now get less results than someone else just casually inviting her to a dinner I know she'd usually surely decline. After telling her about how I feel about this she got understandably mad as she didn't feel like I'd appreciate her progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling this way?",

I've known the team captain for a little more than four years now, though only got to be close friends in the last year after I joined this club.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the actual story: my team was recently issued a new challenge. To simplify, we have to design and build a robot to pick up and place different manipulatives at different heights. During the first week of our building period, the team spends a lot of time brainstorming and drawing up ideas for possible solutions to the problem. It seemed like every single time I'd try to even suggest an idea for what we could do, it'd be immediately shot down by the team captain. This happened with just about everything relating to our robot, and eventually, I just gave up, and just went with whatever the rest of the team and he decided on. (Since apparently he was fine with taking suggestions from them; can you tell I'm still a little salty about this?) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point, we (the leadership team in the club) were discussing the final direction were looking for the robot to go in since we needed to get started with building. I suggested that we attempt to build a system to shoot one of the game pieces (a ball) in order to get it up higher. I was immediately met with \"That won't work because we tried to make a shooter a few years ago and it didn't work.\" (No other explanation. Keep in mind I wasn't around the club when this previously happened, so I didn't know.) I hung back from the conversation for a little bit, but noticed something just a few minutes later. Team captain suggests to get the ball higher we should re-use an elevator system we built last year. One of my friends in the club asked if it was wise to try and re-use it since it didn't work before and our captain immediately responded with \"We can make it work this time.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know he means well, but it felt insulting to be given this title of \"Design Lead\" and then be completely ignored in terms of design. I got upset, and in a private message, (we'd been in a team Discord server up until this point) said that he was being hypocritical to immediately shut down my ideas about re-using concepts from past years but to be accepting of it when he came up with it. He responded to me with a curt response that went something along the lines of \"you don't know what you're talking about.\" He later told me that it made him angry that I'd suggest he was being hypocritical when he just didn't want to spend time dwelling on ideas that he knew wouldn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've talked it over (thought not to the extent that I would have liked since I still don't really feel like he gets how terrible I felt about being so useless for a whole week.) and there isn't any bad blood between us. That said, I figured I'd ask for public opinion since it's been eating me up inside. AITA/too sensitive?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: My ideas for a group project were being ignored and I called the person shutting me down a hypocrite for it, making him upset. AITA?",

She is completely narcissistic to the point where she has ruined our younger brother\u2019s relationship with our family by interrupting him so often that he\u2019s completely given up on trying to have conversation with anyone. She is violent and has caused my father to need stitches several times from biting him. She\u2019s hit us with dining room chairs, stabbed people with pencils, and over Christmas threatened to maim my boyfriend. \n\nOur parents have never done anything to stop or correct her behavior, simply saying that she\u2019s special needs and can\u2019t help herself. She once punched me in the face so hard that she broke my glasses, and instead of disciplining her my mother told me that if I ever hit her back or tried to defend myself against her she would call the police on me and disown me. \n\nI know my parents are a big part of why she\u2019s like this, but she does know better.

I\u2019ve decided to have a conversation with my mother and let her know that I have no interest in seeing my sibling anymore and to please not ask me to attend events that she will be at. I\u2019ve tried for the past 15 years to look past all that and get along with her, but I don\u2019t think I care enough anymore.

I told her that she wasn't my type. \n\nMiranda was...a weird girl. Some days she'll come to school normal, but some days she'll come mad or sad (probably over an argument over siblings or parents). She's violent too. She got into a fight last year and got ISS (in school suspension) for 2 days. For her close friends (like me) she'll \"playfully\" hurt them. She would sometimes punch me, kick me, etc. aswell as to others. She also uses foul language most of the time too. She gives out hints that she may likes me (ex. getting too close to me, asking for hugs and if I decline she'll get pissed, etc.)\n\nThat was the reason why Miranda wasn't my type, and why I would never go out with her because she's a foul human being. But you see, I can be nice sometimes so I didn't say all of that to Grace. I told her that her emotions can be mixed up. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's when I said where she'll sometimes be happy, sad, or mad. Forgot to mention that this can change anytime throughout the day.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure Miranda heard what I said, so she was pretty sad for a few days. I avoided her most of the time, and focused on my other friends. Her friends (only like 2 of them) kept saying over and over to say sorry to her. I didn't want to. Why? She's sensitive. When she says something rude to me I could give no shits. But when I say something rude, she'll start complaining how rude I am and shit. It gets annoying which is why I usually act passive towards her.\n\nI forgot what happened later, but here's the aftermath:\nWe started to eachother like before. I try to avoid her sometimes, but when I have no one else to talk to she's the only option.\n\nMiranda ended up being alone for Valentine's Day since I didn't bother to ask her out. I got a very sweet girlfriend and we hung out that time.\n\nYesterday she asked if I don't want to hang out with her anymore since I avoid her most of the time. I didn't answer the question because I don't want to make this situation worse.\n\n\nWhile writing this story, it looks like I was an asshole at some parts but was mostly Miranda that was the asshole.

To which he responded that he \"didn't know the password and to ask her (step) mom.\" Now this was weird because how could the guy that could look at the camera for the doorbell not know the password?\n\nAnyways, we didn't think too much about it, and decided to go get me settled in the motorhome and watch Netflix. We also texted her mom and asked her the same thing to which she responded that she didn't know and to ask her dad. Now this was confusing, and honestly I was getting pretty upset. \n\nNow to preface this, we had tried to come to house early where we were locked out and her sister(18) was able to come home and unlock the door with the password. We asked if we could know the password and she said no because it was her password.\n\nSo fast forward, we ended falling asleep, and I woke up at 4 with terrible heartburn and was unable to get inside so we both just stayed out in the motorhome. Cue the morning, where we received texts from her stepmother on how disappointed she was in my gf and wouldn't accept any apology.\n\nSo not only, was I tired and sick but now I was angry because we had been lied to and then treated like children. So I, in my infinite wisdom, decided I was going to let her mother know of my disdain. I was riled up. When we went to door I shook the handle and then knocked. When her sister answered she said you couldve just knocked or rang the door bell. I said something disenchanted. Ended up getting into an argument with her mother who said that she was blameless and put it all on my gf for making her out to be the \"evil stepmom\". I ended up leaving the house in a fury because they would not budge. \n\nNow they keep holding it over my head even though I apologized to the mother.  I am now engaged to my gf and they have told lie after lie to try to break us up. \n\nTL;DR gfs parents locked us out of the house with no way to get back in, I got mad, they accept no responsibility and keep holding it over my head.

So, in the end, I decided  to go to the event just for a few hours, and go just before the time I was supposed  to meet my friends.  The event ended up being longer than I expected it. I lost track of time and I had really bad reception, I did not tell all of my friends I was going  to the event,  but a couple  of them knew.  In the end they were upset because I was a few hours late.  Their argument was that we did arranged our game night with a day in anticipation and they thought  I stood them up because I had other better plans.  That wasn't  the case for me, I was going to go with them but the event took longer than i expected  it,  and I was planning to meet them after. Maybe my mistake was not to tell everyone  that I was going to the event for a couple  of hours. To be honest  I was having fun,  but when I noticed they  were upset,  I felt guilty for having fun.  I already apologize to them,  but I wanna know your opinions. Am I missing something, AITA in this situation?",

Most days I like him. His biggest flaw is his sense of humour. Off-colour paired with sarcasm so strong that we can never tell whether he is serious or not. Not harmful by any means, but very annoying.\n\nHe jokes with everyone, but he likes to tease me the most because I can't help but react strongly. His favourite thing is hiding my phone. If I ever let go of my phone, he will silently snatch it up and hide it somewhere. Once I realize it's gone, he makes me guess where it is. Most of the time, it's somewhere innocent like a random cupboard or under someone else's seat. \n\nThere has only been a few times where his jokes genuinely upset me, but even then dealing with my sister and my BIL can be exhausting for me. Part of the reason I put up with it is because of how many times they help me. I work hard, but I don't have a secure source of income and can barely pay my bills. Sister helps by giving me a container of leftovers whenever I visit, or she asks me if I want any old clothes or accessories that she is throwing out. While it's very nice of her to do those things, it makes me feel like a charity case. \n\nFast forward to now:\n\nBIL took my new phone and hid it in one of those wet whipe containers that he thought was empty. There were no cloths, but there was an inch of cleaning liquid at the bottom that he didn't notice. My phone soaked up that liquid like a sponge and died almost instantly.\n\nMy sister yelled at him promising that they would pay for a replacement. BIL wouldn't even apologize. He was frantically researching ways to fix my phone (store it in rice, getting help at the apple store, etc.) and muttering something like how he can't believe he's going spend one of his rebates on replacing my phone. Did I mention that this all happened on his birthday?\n\nMy applecare expired a week before and my phone plan can't give me any better offers so the only thing I can do is buy a new phone at the apple store. I get the oldest and cheapest generation that they have, which ends up costing almost $700. I buy applecare and a new protective case at my own expense. \n\nWhile I would have rather this not happen at all, I'm kind of glad that BIL learned his lesson and maybe he'll leave me alone. Does this make me an asshole?\n\ntl;dr BIL's sense of humor gets on my nerves. One day, his prank ends up costing me my phone. I think the guilt and the cost to replace my phone will teach him not to pick on me. Does it make me a bad person if I'm relieved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

And we both went to bed. The next morning while at work she texted me that she didnt want to talk anymore  and was ashamed of her actions the previous night. I told her that i really like talkimg to her once she opened up and that sex wasn't a  big issue we could have a relationship and i could wait. She told me that she felt it best if we stopped talking altogether and so we did. Until she messaged me a couple hours later apologizing  and saying she was just nervous so we began talking again. Fast forward to later that  night we made plans for her to come over again which she does (to watch a movie)  and we end up having sex.\n\nThis is where it gets TMI.\n\nSo before we  have sex and i start eating her out. ( full of hair) which is to be expected because  she a virgin) and as were having sex , i have her turn around to doggy style. Once she turns around it hits me. I get blindsided by the strongest smell of shit. Immediately have her turn back around. After i tell her to turn we continue to have sex. About 15mins later she asks me to stop and says it hurts. There blood everywhere. After we clean up she starts apologizing.  And i tell her its okay.\n\nAnyways she leaves and then immediately starts freaking out asking if i got her pregnant (we used condoms).

For most of that year myself and my friends never really talked to him. Then eventually we felt bad because he didn't really have no other friends. So, we decide to kind of add Jerry to the group. He seems happy enough and things were going fine until I added him to our group chat. That's when all hell broke loose. First, we had to add him to a separate one because one of my friends (whom I'll call Kat) HATED him. Whenever Jerry and her were together she would just not be for it. So, after Jerry and Kat are separate group chats we realized that Jerry cannot take a joke for his life. So, we have to be literal with everything that we say (which is hard because we all are sarcastic). Once again, it wasn't much of a big deal until Jerry says one day (when for some reason he and Kat were in the same chat) \"Hey Kat I like your ass.\" We were all shocked because he was still new and stuff. Of course we all take offense to this because we've known Kat for longer and we thought he was serious. Then my other friend (we'll call Jub) starts trying to defend him until he says \"Jub I like your ass\" and \"I look at Jub and Kat ass.\" Yeah Jerry was kicked soon after. Jub tried to defend him but the rest of us agreed that he went way too far. Now fast forward to the next school year. Kat had left the school so now there's an open spot at our table for 4 (the rest of the group was spread throughout different classes). Jerry decides to take it. Here comes part two. We notice that Jerry tends to stare... In the wrong places. In a group of 80% girls this is a problem. On top of that he doesn't do his work (a problem for a group of people who do their work) and is a constant distraction. He also starts to be VERY annoying. He will constantly try to peek into others conversations, fake a throw or hit to you and swap pencils. All of us start to become very annoyed. Even Jub, who at first defended him wanted to cut him off. I wanted to give him one last chance however. So we kept him. Now here's the final straw. He starts to hangout with this group of boys we call \"roaches.\" They are loud, disrespectful, and just all around annoying. So now, Jerry's attracting the wrong people over here and we're all over it. My two other friends in the class have already cut him off but I'm hesitant to. So, Jerry constantly is around me doing the same stuff. I've tried to subtly cut him off but he's too dense to realize the hints. He's also recently said things about my girlfriends ass and I didn't like that. \n\nLong story short: Am I the Asshole if I cut off a person who is a pervert, constantly being annoying and distracting, and said perveted things about my girlfriend?\n\n",

He's very flamboyant and metrosexual, we bonded quite easily and I made the mistake of saying that I thought we might have been best friends in another life. It's not long before he mentions his GF, Lana (F 28)... now things start getting a little weird. Pablo tells me that right before him and Lana started dating he had been in a very serious relationship that was heading towards marriage, when the girl suddenly ghosted him with no explanation whatsoever.  He goes on to tell me that even though he is 100% committed to Lana, he's not over what happened and he just hasn't really been giving it 100% (yikes, but I decide not to judge him because I've had my heart broken too and know what it feels like to be trying to move on)...\n\nSoon Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana. We link up for happy hour, I meet her and she is really sweet and wonderful. I like her a lot.  Now Pablo and Lana start inviting me out more and more as well as paying for me (even though I wanted to paying for myself), first it was weekly then progressively more and more... I have a really busy schedule and pretty full life, so I'm just not available that much and can't hang out as much as they would like to.... I'm actually relieved when the holidays come because they finally let up on asking me to hang out as much.\n\nNow during this time I actually think things are getting better and our friendship is balancing out... WRONG! Pablo messages me and tells me to go to the \\*\\*\\*\\* (expensive clothing brand) website and pick out my Christmas gift, anything I want! This makes me feel a little uncomfortable because me and my friends don't spend that much money on each other during the holidays and I usually do home made gifts, so I pick out something very modest. We meet up before Christmas to exchange gifts (I made them a thoughtful couples gift) and everything seems pretty good... Then a few days later he sends me a picture of a second gift he has gotten me.... Okay, what? WHY??????\n\nNow I'm asking myself if Lana knows about this? Pablo gives me the impression that she does know because he bought her the same gift as me plus more.  So I start asking if I'm just not used to someone being so generous towards me and if I'm making this into something it's not???\n\nI decide to ignore my gut feeling and not get all weirded out by it. (I've never been comfortable accepting gifts from men because in my experience they take it to mean I want something more.)\n\nJump forward to about a week ago. I'm in for another hair cut and  Pablo brings up the gift thing... he goes on about how he usually spends so much more money on his friends, and that my gifts were so cheap that's why he bought me two... okay? Then while I'm getting my hair washed Pablo says \"Do you know what I like about your body? I love how curvy your hips are and that you're not fat.\"  I just feel like this is too \"friendly\"....\n\nI should also take this time to say that I am in no way sexually attracted to Pablo. I think he has a really cool personality and we get along really well as friends, except that I think he wants to hang out too often and is too friendly sometimes.\n\nNow I start confiding in my best friend and she says that is completely inappropriate and disrespectful to his GF.  I agree and decide its best decide to talk to his GF about it next time I see her. So, the next day Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana, I agree. We end up going to a concert a day later and there's just no good time to talk to her... Plus I ate something that wrecked my stomach. I was in so much pain by the end, I told them I needed to go home and didn't feel well. They said that they were going to go hot tubing and that if I felt better I should join them. I told them the chances of that were basically non existent. I go home, take some tums and crawl into bed. as soon as I'm snuggled under the covers I get 3 texts.... 2 from her and 1 from him... both basically saying \"we're at the hot tub, when are you coming over?\"\n\nNow at this point, I'm getting really annoyed. I reply back \"My stomach is wrecked so I'm taking some tums and going to bed.\" Lana replies to \"Feel better\" and Pablo replies \"Damn! You still look good though!  Coming back out tonight?\" I didn't reply and I put both of their numbers on do not disturb mode. (also no this is not a group text, they both message me separately... her not so much, but him like everyday.)\n\nI'm also starting to realize that Pablo has my schedule memorized.

I've told them before that I'm not a very high maintenance friend and that I don't need to text or see people THAT often. I also feel like the more often he tries to see me the less I want to see him. I like having space and time to myself, and I am very, very close with my family and see them at least 5 times a week. Plus I have best friends I've known for 10 years that I prefer to see when I get the chance.... I have also told them this in a nice way, and I just think it is selfish of them to try and bogart all of my time. They stress me out and annoy me when they ask me my plans every single day and then want to invite themselves to do things. Sorry, but I am a serious gym goer and don't want distractions. I spend two hours at the gym and have a set routine.\n\nI definitely feel like the asshole here, but 'I also feel like he is becoming obsessed with me or something... i really don't know.\n\nPlease help!",

            "input": "Sorry for the Wall of text but there\u2019s a lot of detail to this story so let\u2019s start off at the beginning.\n\nMy girlfriend(21) and I(26) have hit a rough patch in our relationship after dating for two years and it\u2019s about sex. We haven\u2019t had sex for the past 6 weeks and it\u2019s really started to build up sexual frustration inside of me. She knows that this bothers me but doesn\u2019t have sex just because she\u2019s a little tired(even when she wants it as well). This happens all of the time and it\u2019s usually me who initiates sex because she\u2019s never been the aggressive type to start it. This really bothers me because I feel like I have to force myself into her just to get her into the mood but she reassures me that this is how she likes it. I feel uncomfortable with this because I don\u2019t ever want to cross the line and go to far.\n\nAnother thing to add is that we don\u2019t get very much alone time to begin with because she still lives with her family due to her culture(she\u2019s from Mexico) so the time we can sleep together in the same bed is super limited with no one being there. Even when the stars align and we have the night to ourselves she still pulls the \u201ctired\u201d card even knowing it may be a long while before we get a chance like this again. So today I got mad at her for not having sex even when she said she was in the mood but just a little tired. We ended up getting into a huge fight about it because it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s physically attracted to me anymore because the passion and all the small things we use to do to show interest are just gone. She doesn\u2019t text me cute and sexy things anymore, she doesn\u2019t grab my butt or whisper things into my ear anymore. It just all randomly stopped. I told her that I\u2019m like any other human and want to be physically showed that she still thinks I\u2019m attractive(she ensures me that she still finds me attentive) and then she yells at me telling me that I don\u2019t respect her feelings because she didn\u2019t want to have sex because she was a little tired (even though she\u2019s having the urges to have sex with me). She then tells me that everyone would be disgusted with me for even having his conversation and that I\u2019m an asshole for even talking about this topic. I\u2019ve respected everything that her culture and family have thrown my way from not being able to spend the night over at her place until we get married, she\u2019s not allowed to spend the night at my place but somethings says she\u2019s spending the night at friends to sleep over. Even then a lot of the time we don\u2019t have sex. I try my hardest to except her way of life but when I bring up the sex topic she doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s incredibly important to me not only physically but emotionally as well. I want to be showed that I\u2019m still attractive to someone else. She puts me as this pervert who should be ashamed of myself if anyone knew that we have this fight. \n\nAlso she has expressed that sex isn\u2019t the most important thing to her in a relationship since the very beginning (it\u2019s not for me either but it is important) but she\u2019s always loved it and was happy to do it frequent for the first year and a half of our relationship.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

She has tons of guy friends who are constantly trying to do shit with her and she\u2019s always secretive about it. She has also cheated on me twice, both times were within a week and with my 2 best friends at the time but she didn\u2019t tell me until 10 months later because she could argue it was \u201csooo long ago\u201d. Meanwhile I have been loyal the entire time and only talk to her, my 2 best guy friends, and 2 other \u201cgirl-friends\u201d who I\u2019ve known WAY before I even met my GF. Also things have been kinda rough for the last couple of months due to her randomly lashing out on me and calling me names and shit and ignoring me, which I usually just brush off because I can\u2019t really do anything about it. \n\nNow, time for the actual story: I was at this college fair hosted by our school and I was just walking around and chilling with my gf. All the other schools within like 15-30 miles were there. So naturally I saw one of my \u201cgirl-friends\u201d, we\u2019ll call her Lauren. At first I wanted to go up and say Hello and whatever but then out of the corner of my eye I caught my GF giving me a look of almost pure hatred. So we (Lauren and I) ended up just smiling at each other and going about our business. I could tell that right after seeing Lauren, my GFs mood did a complete 180 and she was dry and emotionless towards me. Mind you, it was only directed at me because she was fine talking to her other friends and stuff. Anyways, after about 2 hours of just chilling and walking around and me trying to make awkward conversation that ultimately led to no response from her end; she just started going on about how much she hated Lauren and how ugly and gross she is and how she\u2019s annoying (even though she doesn\u2019t talk to her) and just shit like that. To me, I could deal with her being upset at me but it crossed a line when she just started bashing my friend like that (Lauren and I are good friends and nothing more than that, Lauren respects the hell outta my GF). So I stuck up for my friend saying that Lauren has done NOTHING wrong at all. Then she pulled this out of her ass... \u201cOh yeah, I forgot you two were dating\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to say after that so I just walked away without saying a word, she followed but we didn\u2019t talk. Now for the past week she\u2019s been threatening to end our relationship over this and saying shit like \u201cyou don\u2019t love me and you never have\u201d. AITA that caused this?",

I see in her that she hates doing it and she physically is not in a place that she really has the ability to do all that. \n\nIt's made me really think about the future. My SO's parents and my mother are all around the same 5 year range at around 58 years old and I've come to realize that it may not be very long until the choice comes up where they either will need a 24/7 in home caretaker, or they'll need to be in a nursing home. All three of them have made it very clear that none of them are going to a nursing home, but I know that none of them will ever have that kind of money either. \n\nMy SO has another sister and brother, but my SO is pretty convinced that their already-established lives won't permit them to care for his parents so at this point he's low key planning our future around having to care for his parents when they get older. \n\nMy mother and I never had much of a relationship  long story short, she is narcissistic and emotionally abusive. Every time the topic comes up, she basically guilt trips me into feeling bad for not wanting to care for her when she becomes unable to, and it always ends with me saying \"I'm not planning for that right now.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to care for either my mother or my in-laws when they're not able to anymore? If I do that, I'm pretty certain that I won't be able to pay bills, and what about my future children? How old will they be? Will I need to take care of them as well? Will my SO help me, or will he just go to work, come home, and go to bed? All these things I wonder about and it really stresses me out about the future. ",

I mostly lived with my mom and went to my dad for the weekends and honestly that was also fine by me.\n\nAfter a while my dad started seeing this women who was represented to me as his \u201cfriend\u201d and MY \u201cfriend\u201d also. And please note that during the time I wasn\u2019t capable of determining what was the difference between friendship and relationship. Therefore for the the longest time I thought they were just friends.\n\nFast forward to the day when my mom pulls me aside and starts talking about how my dad is actually in a relationship with this woman and that they like each other since they never bothered to explain it to me. And honestly I was pretty shocked but again I was ok with that also because I knew my dad was bad at explaining and expressing stuff and during the time I liked her girlfriend.\n\nSooo again fast forward to when I am around 13 my dads girlfriend tries convincing my mom to tell me that her and my dad are getting married but my dad is bad at talking so that she wants her to do it. As a result my mom gets irritated and tells them that it\u2019s them that they are getting married therefore my dad should be the one explaining this to me. So my stepmom cones back home and a few hours pass, then we all start playing this game while its my dads turn to play she starts explaining how they\u2019re getting married and etc. And my initial thought was happiness although it was a bit awkward that it was her telling me this and not my dad and that my dad just kept playing the game without really saying anything.\nLike during the time I didn\u2019t care and instead I just asked when was their wedding because I obviously wanted to attend. And she said it was a week later. During the time I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that because I was shy and also was reluctant on how to show my feelings so I was just like \u201cohhh ok but my school starts next week...\u201d and she was just like \u201cYeah well it\u2019s not going to be crowded anyways it is going to be small and boring.\u201d\nAgain I say NOTHING.Because honestly I just want to be nice. However then she starts talking about how her family actually doesn\u2019t know I even exist because where she cones from it is NOT ACCEPTABLE to marry a man who already has a kid.\n\nI realized how fucked up by this as I grew older and actually started to understand what was actually happening. However me and my mom moved to another country and I saw my dad like around a week a year as a result. \n\n2 years ago when I visited him we all had a fight because his wife was trying to hide me from her mom when all I was trying to do was to get my stuff and get out of there. But yeah so we all got into a fight his wife tried to pull me back into the house and ran after me when I left the house crying just to look good for my dad which good me even more mad. However again after 2 months my dad visited me and we solved our shit but I haven\u2019t talked to his wife on the phone or anything since.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago ( I am 16 btw) he called me on the phone and we were talking about my life and what he was doing casually and he basically just told me that his wife was 7 months pregnant which I just replied with \u201cOhh great Im happy for you!\u201d Then after when he hung up. I just started crying because initially I didn\u2019t want a step sibling at all.\n \nTl;Dr : My step moms family doesn\u2019t know I exist, she did not want me in her wedding therefore planned it in such way and my dad shows little to no reaction to this and tells me that her wife is 7 months pregnant on the phone.

I can say that I probably haven\u2019t handled it the best but I\u2019d like to see where other people\u2019s opinions lay. As a a background I am Bi-sexual, that will make more sense as you read.\n\nWhen I was almost 11 I was molested by a friends uncle down the street. This happened right around the time that Obama was first running for office and the gay rights movement was in full swing especially here in Seattle. My mother is deeply religious and can always be heard saying things along the line of \u201cGays burn in Hell.\u201d and \u201cI would never tolerate that.\u201d For that reason as well as the fact that my father is very emotionally distant from my family is the reason I\u2019ve never told anyone until very recently. I grew up feeling vilified, like my whole family hated me. Along with my mother making me feel less than dirt my brother bragged about beating up gays and my grandmother saying the same things. When I was 13 we found out that I am highly allergic to dogs and moderately allergic to dogs. We\u2019ve always had at least two dogs and cats that are indoor/outdoor pets. My parents didn\u2019t want to get rid of them and never pursued any sort of solution for me but instead insisted that I had something else wrong with me. Often I would hear jokes such as \u201cI\u2019d get rid of the dogs before you.\u201d and \u201cThe dogs are more my children than you.\u201d That led to me having to take all manners of medication that I didn\u2019t need. The allergies crippled me to the point where I missed around 100 days of school per year, as expected my grades fell. I still managed to get into a running start program where I got my ASE\u2019s, as well as transfer into a technical high school program where I used the state to pay for my education. I suffered through my classes but when I felt well I crushed them, sadly that wasn\u2019t often. I still haven\u2019t graduated high school technically. \nMy relationship with my family is not great. I\u2019ve tried to ignore it all and build up good relations with them but that has built up resentment. I haven\u2019t been the best son undoubtedly. The past couple years when I have heard them say something homophobic I usually respond with something along the lines of \u201cStoping being such a judgmental bitch.\u201d which usually gets me punched in the head a few times and kicked out of the house for a bit. \nThe last time something like this happened my father came to pick me up after my mother stopped in traffic to bust my lip open and bruise my jaw then kicked me out into traffic. \nWhen he picked me up I opened up to him about what happened when I was younger. He told me he was sorry for what I have been through but it was wrong for me to be upset with my mothers actions and comments because \u201cShe cannot relate to homosexuals because she doesn\u2019t have anyone as such in her life to make it personal.\u201d As well he told me I need to bring this up to her and forgive her for everything. \nI can\u2019t help but feel robbed of an education and a childhood. It was one thing to be molested and have to deal with that and the backlash that comes with being bi-sexual in public school. It\u2019s another thing to not have a support system, to feel hated by humanity and your family, to be lower on the ladder than dogs and referred to as \u201cGods joke.\u201d I haven\u2019t been able to talk to any of my family not only about this situation but any hardship due to this barrier. \nI genuinely dislike most of my family and I hate that I feel that way. I am upset about how I have been treated and the opportunities I\u2019ve lost. \nI don\u2019t know what else to do or say. I\u2019m sorry that this post is such a mess, I have a splitting headache and I\u2019m fairly stressed out. Thank you for taking some of your time to read this. ",

When we were together she hardly worked or did anything helpful around the house, deciding just to spend what little money she had on beer and cigarettes. We finally separated after she disappeared with my daughter one night drinking while out drinking with her friends while I was working.\nFast forward to earlier this year. I had primary custody because I lived in a better area and paid for everything anyways. The agreement was that my daughter would be with me during the school year and visit her every other weekend and for holidays, then vice versa during the summer. It went fairly ok until the first week her mother was supposed to take her. \nHer plan was to visit her parents out of the state for about a week. After a day or 2 I get a frantic call from her parents telling me that my ex was freaking out, breaking stuff in their house and left the house with my daughter and her sister (not mine) and were walking around town with no money and nowhere to go. Now they had a history of drug abuse in their youth but have since cleaned up, so they had an idea of what this behavior looked like. They told me that they had suspected her to be using meth for a long time and this was confirming their belief, seeing this as her going through withdrawals. She eventually showed back up to their house and I talked her into letting me take my daughter for awhile until she calmed down.\nI immediately bought plane ticket, flew out to get my daughter, and filed an emergency court order and took full custody. She never appeared to the following court dates so I won custody with no battle. I gave her the chance to visit my daughter during this whole process, which she never did and only called every couple of weeks.\nNow, a couple months ago, she was arrested with a couple people for possession of methamphetamine among other things. I told her that she needed to clean up if she wanted to see her daughter, but she has just denied ever even having a drug problem. I tried to smooth things out with my daughter by telling her that her mother was 'sick from taking bd medicine and had to get better before she could take care of her again'. It was the best thing I could come up with without telling her that her mother is a junkie.\nWell now her mother is telling her that I'm lying and that she was never sick, etc. My daughter was really confused and told me she didn't know who to believe. As soon as I heard that I knew I had to tell her the truth or risk our relationship. So I told her that her mother got in trouble with the police after using some 'bad medicine' and that she needed to make better decisions before she could take care of her again. Now my daughter is making notes for her mother saying shes sorry shes in jail and is mad at the police for arresting her. \nI'm not sure what to do or if I made the right choice in telling her the truth. Her mother already tells me how terrible I am weekly, and it's starting to wear on me a little. Am I an asshole?\nTLDR: Daughters mother was using meth but lying to my daughter (5yo) and telling her that I was keeping them apart for no reason so I told my daughter that she was arrested.",

Our best friends were also our neighbors.\nThe whole clique is very intimate and two of the couples had swap their partners in bed a few years ago. But I always said, that's not my business.\nMy best friend married in July and 5 weeks after that day she found out that her husband had cheated on her with two of our girlfriends in the clique (which were also married). He sent dick pics of him, secretly took photos of her naked while she was asleep and sent them to our friends, sexting with these girls and so on. When she found out she was depressed and cut our \"friends\" off for obviously reasons.\nI did my best to help her heal her heart and make her a bit happier. She decided to not break up with her husband, because they have a 7 years old boy and he promised her to never do it again (info: It wasn't the first time he did this..more like the 4th time).\nI was not thrilled, when she told me this but as a good friend I told her my opinion and also that I  would be there even when he is a dumbass and she will take him back. She thanked me for my support.\nI also cut off our other friends, because on the one hand I wanted to be supportive for my friend and on the other hand these things were morally reprehensible and I don't want to be friends with these peoples.\nIt was a big thing for me to do so, because I have a social anxiety (I'm afraid to stand up for me and my opinions because I don't want to make anyone angry or hating me) but when I have done this I felt proud for me.\n\nNow my friend have forgive them all and is happy with these false friends and it makes me very angry. I don't want to be friends with these peoples and I think what she does is dumb as fuck and I told her so. They have betrayed her, but a few month after all these things happened everything is okay and I'm sitting here locked out from the clique for being a good friend.\nSo I decided to cut off with her and looking forward for new friends, since she told me I should not stick my nose in her life and I should be happy that she had forgive them. \n\nNow she texted me I am a bitch and a bad friend for breaking our relationship, but she doesn't want to hear my arguments and just insults me. I have tried to be friends even she is befriended with the old clique but it cuts my heart of to see what she have done to herself and my work to fix up her heart again. I believe that these friends will hurt her again and she don't want to listen.\nMy husband couldn't stand her since they met the first time, so he is happy to see that I have broken up with her but I am feeling like I am the asshole for no accepting her decisions. \n\t\ntl,dr: cut off my best friend for her decisions to forgive people who hurt her months ago \n\t\n",

When we first met, we were just hooking up and she told me the second night we hooked up that she sells naked photos of herself. I told her that\u2019s fine. About 3 weeks into us hooking up, she told me she wanted to stop selling naked photos of herself because she wanted me to be the only person to see her naked. That was the starting off point for our relationship, it made me realize we actually really liked each other.\n\nThe fact that she sold naked pictures didn\u2019t cross my mind for the first few months of us dating until I realized she\u2019s still friends with some of the guys she sold pictures to. I told her I was uncomfortable with that, but she told me the ones she\u2019s still friends with she was friends with before she sold naked pictures to them and she didn\u2019t feel right ending a friendship with them just because they bought pictures from her and now she has a boyfriend. She also said that she doesn\u2019t mind that I\u2019m friends with girls I\u2019ve hooked up with or wanted to hook up with, so what\u2019s the difference. I think of it as different than someone she hooked up with, it\u2019s like these guys were her customers. She\u2019s not really close with any of them as friends, but they interact on various social media platforms here and there.\n\nThis is been an issue on and off in our relationship. I\u2019ll forget about it for months and then I\u2019ll think about it and it makes me uncomfortable. It always starts a fight between us because I\u2019ll get really closed off/not affectionate when I think about it and she feels like I\u2019m making her feel ashamed for the fact that she sold naked pictures of herself. I\u2019ve tried to not think about it, but it still crosses my mind. \n\nWe\u2019ve been having fights about it these last few days because I told her I don\u2019t want her to talk to anyone she\u2019s sold pictures to. I didn\u2019t say she has to, but in an ideal world I would want her to not interact with them. She said she barely even talks to them, they just occasionally respond to an Instagram story she\u2019ll post or like a tweet of hers. She said it would be rude to cut out her friends and, again, that I\u2019m free to talk to girls I\u2019ve hooked up with. All of this came to a head today when I said what it comes down to is that I\u2019m embarrassed that she sold these kind of pictures. This upset and angered her. She said why did I tell her I was fine with it when we started hooking up, and I told her that truthfully I wasn\u2019t really fine with it then either, I just didn\u2019t want to seem uncool or judgmental. She\u2019s hurt now and says she\u2019s going to have a hard time getting over this because she feels like I\u2019m shaming her. \n\nTLDR: my wife sold naked pictures of herself while we were just hooking up. she stopped before we started dating but it bothers me that she still interacts with guys who were her friends who bought pictures. today I told her I\u2019m embarrassed that that she sold naked pics and she\u2019s upset ",

            "input": "I have a deep relationship with a friend from undergrad. We now live a few hours away from each other by car but often call each other on the phone. He introduced me to Buddhism and overall we've been supporting each other for a while now. At least so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I was writing a thesis to graduate, and it wasn't easy. Though I started seeing writing as a tool for discovering my thoughts, meaning I had to write through my confusion (as opposed to putting down thoughts in writing, meaning I had to think through my confusion), I was still feeling very confused and many of my unresolved insecurities were coming back up. So I would call up my friend, believing he'd lend a kind ear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow mind you, my friend is going through a depression with its ups and downs. Recently, he's been battling with how neither stopping weed nor getting into a relationship with someone he is deeply attracted to solved his loneliness. He also is staying with his grandma because she's getting very old.\n\nWe tripped on New Year's and he realised how his worldview might have been limited by his lack of seeing different perspectives (through e.g. travel), and how he may not agree with the way the NGO he's organising for is going about its intentions (he doesn't work, his only job is that NGO). I realised how much of my confusion around the thesis was coming from a place of arrogance/hubris, and how accepting that I didn't know anything helped me see what I had refused to learn about and opened the door to changing my relationship with confusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last time I called him, he more or less hangs up on me and tells me he doesn't have time for me, then texts me I am not his soapbox and if I seek help the only thing he can advise is to \"sit\" (i.e. meditate) and \"journal\". I respond to him that if those words were enough they'd have worked ages ago, and to check his own hubris, i.e. that he was acting towards my situation the way I used to act around my thesis.\n\nHe doesn't take it well, and I tell him that since he's not in the headspace to do so, I'll just hold off on it until the thesis is done and just get support from e.g. my parents. But he believed I was trying to guilt him into being there for me, which I said was his interpretation. Then he links me to a post about gaslighting, and tells me how I kept saying it was his interpretation was an attempt to absolve myself off the responsibility for making him feel bad to not have the space to help me with my problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he's the one gaslighting me (albeit unconsciously), and it's not the first time either. This event brought up all the times he projected his self-flagellation onto my behaviour. Whenever I criticise him on anything touchy he blames me for making him feel bad. One example: he told me about a project that could happen where he'd partner with his friend to provide yoga and Buddhist teachings to groups, and then proceeded to lash out at me for twenty minutes because me saying \"then make it happen\" was me \"sounding like \\[his\\] father\". Combined with the fact that most of the times when he comes visit me it's a byproduct of an event of his sister (who lives in the same city as I do) that he's attending (wedding, graduation, etc.), whereas I often go to where he lives just to see him, despite having other friends there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall I'm tired of talking to him, because I do not want to be blamed for putting expectations on him that I'm not putting. It's a pretty basic matter of trust between friends to accept that I do not have an evil or burdening intent towards him when I tell him my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis pattern has got so bad I'm almost led to ask a WIBTA. Right before this shit happened, he told me he won't end up traveling because he took more responsibilities with his NGO, and I felt like he might have backtracked on his new year's realisations. But I didn't tell him that, I guess because I was so worried about walking on eggshells around his feelings. So I didn't tell him anything, and waited to submit my thesis before getting back and offloading to reddit the judgement on who's gaslighting whom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: My friend believes I gaslit him because I told him that it's his interpretation that me telling him I understand he's not in the place to support me is actually guilting him into emotionally supporting me through a tough time. I think he's unconsciously gaslighting me by blaming me for his own perfectionism, and distorting my words to put in them an intent to burden him.",

I have a habit of quietly singing under my breath when I'm bored, which is pretty important to the story. Behind me were two older women, 50-60 ish, who were doing the typical older lady thing of being judgmental as fuck. \n\nSuch highlights including:\n- pointing out someone's highlights and saying how she looked like a skunk \n- saying someone's shirt looked like a huge stain\n- looking at my shoes and calling them dreadful\n\nYou get the gist. We were in the queue for about 15 minutes (the whole intermission) and when we were t the front of the queue a smaller lady dashed in to quickly wash her hands. The women behind me noticed this and were quick to start on the 'we were waiting longer and first' etc etc, which is fine- they misunderstood her intentions. \n\nThen one of them turned to the other and said 'I bet she's Russian, all Russians are terribly rude.' Her friend nodded along and recalled her time in Russia when the first lady finished with, 'Any Eastern European really, rude and dirty.'\n\nAlthough I speak very little Russian, I am not Russian in the slightest. Nor am I Eastern European in anyway, but to hear someone stereotype like that really got me, so I decided to drop the hammer as such. I pulled up my emergency screenshot of my dad's phonescreen to make it look like I was actually in a call and began to loudly speak the little Russian I know and formed it into what sounded like a conversation ('Hello', 'Good, Thank you.', 'And you?', 'Yes, No', 'Goodbye') or at least something a non-native speaker wouldn't cringe at. After my quick 1 minute phonecall, I hung up and then helped another different old lady with something and spoke to their in English so that they would know that I had understood them. One of them ended up needing to use something before me so I used the Russian form of 'after you' to address her. They were both quite embarrassed and now I feel quite bad. \n\nAITA?",

I'm personally against casual sex and drug use although i'm fine for other people to do it, it's just not the lifestyle i've ever wanted.

I'm sure you can see where this is going.\n\nI found out that her and her previous boyfriend were poly and into a lot of crazy stuff, threesomes with both genders, using drugs, and obviously her partner count of both men and women was a lot higher than she said. Again, I have no problem with this lifestyle it's just not something I would want for myself or for the woman I marry.\n\nI confronted her about this and eventually got the truth confirmed after a lot of evasiveness. She says all that poly/drug stuff before was what made her realize that she wanted the conventional monogamous marriage with loads of kids etc and a clean life just like me and only lied to me because she knew a man looking for that wouldn't want to marry a woman with her past. \n\nThat makes sense because i'm seriously thinking about breaking up with her over this, firstly because she lied to me for so long about stuff she knew was important to me, second because of insecurity. Like she's the best sex of my life but what if I rank only 20th or something for her? Could someone who lived that life be happy with the \"square\" life with me? And since she's apparently bisexual could she ever be happy without women? What if she's only using me as the \"safe\" man she settles down with and cheats on me? If I marry her will I end up regretting that I missed a huge red flag?\n\nThose are questions for me to decide on, my question to all you is: WIBTA to throw away the best relationship of my life over this?

She brought her boyfriend with her, who the kids never knew until that month. He has repeatedly threatened to hit my niece and nephew with a belt, screaming at them, while my sister lets him, hell she even does the same thing.  I despise the fact people hit their kids, especially if you hit them hard enough to fall down and cant get up. My sister yells at the kids for getting mad at her, when SHE does them wrong. Her boyfriend is a druggie, he has repeatedly asked my mom to find pills for him, and even hid marijuana in my dad's dresser before my dad passed in January. C is also an uninvited guest, and always tells my sister he's gonna leave, he /does/ but comes back about 10 minutes later just to get her mad. He is also our only way to get around town, as we are too poor to get a car. Oh, my niece is 11 years old by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today, at about 1:30 PM CST my niece wanted to sell an xbox one S for herself, so she was posting about it. She wanted to sell it for about $100 so she could use it for her grandma and herself to go out and eat and get their nails done. Well, in comes sister's boyfriend, lets call him C. He told us he was going to sell it for his boss for $100, he came back with $50 and kept a good bit of the money to himself. He told her he sold it to a pawn shop, which I don't believe. She was telling him to give her her money, which he already owed her $20, and he threatened to take all the money he gave her. My sister and C came upstairs, fuming, about to hit my niece before I yelled at her to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister got mad and started yelling at me, which I'm not going to take her shit. Now, I know my niece disrespects everyone, including me, but I believe it's my sister's way of punishing them as my sister did the same to my mother. Me and my brother do not act like that. My mother never laid a hand on us, and I love my mother dearly and would do anything for her. Her boyfriend started yelling at me, telling me not to get up on him, so i got up out of my chair and stood eye to eye with him, he may be taller than me but I'm not scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if this is jumbled, I'm just angry and trying to get this out.

She wakes up before me so she has to wait for me to finish some things but I make sure I\u2019m done before the time she mentioned she wants to leave.\n\nWhat\u2019s also is not helping is that she used to work (for four months) on the same island before me, however in a completely different field and 7(!) years ago. Every experience I share with her, she dismisses because \u2018no that is not how things go here at all\u2019. All this has made me very defensive for the last couple of days, making me a party pooper that has to chill (...) I just feel that she has taking over my life here and I have to listen to her expert advice about the island (like when driving she tells me I\u2019m not taking the right road, it was better if I took the other way).\n\nAITA for being defensive about her \u201cexpert\u201d remarks of how to do things here and taking time away in the morning of her vacation?",

            "input": "The title indicates that its my money but I'm going to state upfront that me and my husband have a joint account so it is our money. I make more money than him so he has a tendency to ask me about big purchases but I always tell him hey you don't need to ask me to spend our money but if you're unsure about the state of our finances feel free to have a discussion about it with me. That being said, here's the specific situation we're in now.\n\nSo my husband is in a band with his two friends (lets call them Tom, the drummer, and Jim, the bassist). They're not big or trying to become big, but they do play shows locally and have recorded music before and it's on Apple music and such. The recorded their first EP about a year ago and Tom has a best friend (lets call him Connor) who has a recording studio. Connor let them use the recording studio for free/helped record for the first EP. \n\nThey've been working on songs for their new EP and decided they want to record this one as well. A few weeks ago, my husband suggested to Tom and Jim that his friend Dave has a recording studio that he would let them use for free. Tom said that he didn't want to go behind Connor's back and use another recording studio so my husband and Jim said that's fine, they can use Connor's studio again. So they recorded this new EP last week or so. Then yesterday, my husband gets a text from Tom asking for $100 to help pay for the recording. Tom never mentioned having to pay but my husband still feels obligated because he doesn't want any issues with the band. I say obviously if he wants to spend $100 for this, he should do what he wants because again, it's not just my money. Then my husband asks what I think of the situation and what I would do. \n\nI think it was a super asshole move of Tom to not tell them beforehand that it would cost money. Yes technically we have $100 but we're in the midst of planning for a wedding (we got courthouse married and are having the reception in a few months) which Tom knows that we are doing, so money is tight right now. Also my husband took a new job that has potential for growth but was a pay cut from his last job, so again, money is tight. I told my husband that if this was my friend, I'd let them know that I think it's incredibly rude that they didn't tell me beforehand that I'd have to pay, that I would never do that to my friends, and I probably would stand my ground and say that I'm not paying for this. But again, I told my husband it's his band and if he really does want to pay them then fine but I don't think it's a good idea and kind of sets a bad precedent that we can just be gouged for money whenever and we'll role over and pay it.\n\nI feel like maybe I'm being a cheap asshole though? I know recording studio shit takes time and stuff so I don't want to make it seem like I don't value someone's time and help. But Tom already paid his friend and I think if he wanted us to pitch in he should have told us. And like I said my husband had a friend who said he would do it for free.\n\nTLDR AITA for thinking that my husband shouldn't pay his friend/bandmate for studio recording time because he didn't tell him it would cost money beforehand?",

I'm saving for university and general costs of living.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story wraps around one particular military program, that I have applied for, a training program that helps me to become a peacekeeper. All the training and a deployment takes around 2 years. It normally takes half a year if your going to be a normal infantry. The thought of me becoming a peacekeeper startled my father, he doesn't like that, he wants me to go straight to college or university and finish my army stuff as fast as possible. But my plan has been to serve a little longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad is the problem, he has said time to time that you aren't cut for the job, this pisses me off, I shrug it off. I don't want to argue with him. As i usually say: \"I have already made my choice\", but I still listen to him. I should've listened to my closest friends advice, not tell parents, like his brother. I thought this would be more harmful to family relations, but after seeing the results of telling my parents about this, I can tell that I should've done the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf a year ago I had final exams to study and forgot about the army thing. The problem started yesterday when I mailed an application where I accepted to partake in the trials, me and my parents were going to a shopping mall, trying to find a mailbox and get some shopping done. As I was stepping out of the car, father said to me to think this through again, hinting that this was a stupid idea. I froze for a second to process what he said, I quickly gathered my inner self and stepped out of the car. After dropping the letter in the mailbox, it ruined my fathers day, he got sad and ruined the day for everyone else, but I didn't let the feelings get to me even though it was hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater in the evening when I was going for my regular 3 kilometer run. He gave me a note, I read it. It was demands that I start buying and cooking my own food now on, wash all the dished and so on. I could still live in the house and he would still pay the gas for the car because we shared his work car. I just want to add that my father has always done this, a punishment for doing something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Applied for peacekeeper duties to get money for university, lost some family respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hi people of the sub, I had to cut the story dramatically to fit the 3000 word limit, I have the original one which is near 5000 characters long. I can post it, if asked, it goes in to detail about everything. But I hope that this would be enough to make a judgement.** ",

I work all day, and we have 2 dogs (One is a puppy who is currently training and is a huge handful) and 2 cats. I also take my puppy to work with me, which means my work days are very busy handling him AND my job.\n\nI told her I didn't appreciate her volunteering me to do this without asking first. And this is for a number of reasons: I will be having to make sure this dog that I haven't met (And I haven't met her, the classmate, either, only heard her on the phone) isn't aggressive towards my animals. I won't be there when it is left at my house before I get home from work, so it will not know who the fuck I am when I get home. I don't know if the dog will be aggressive to me. It also doesn't know my house and where it should be going to notify me to go outside. There are plenty of reasons not to WANT to watch the dog. I will do it, and certainly have no problems with animals, but there are reasons for me to not be happy about this, imo.\n\nI usually have ZERO issues with being volunteered for certain things. For example, it often occurs where my wife will just randomly tell me she promised family/friends we would go to an event/dinner with them. No big deal. As long as it is a WE thing and not a thing I am stuck doing alone. Not to mention these things are usually fun and not added stress to my already long days of work and puppy-handling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she told me this last night, that she already signed me up for this, I was a bit pissed. I told her she should never do volunteer someone for something like this - I don't want to spend what little time I have at home having to deal with even MORE than I already have to. She began crying, and last night went to sleep upset, and was upset this morning. I am not mad, because I told her what I thought of the situation and that I thought it was inconsiderate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe keeps saying it's not a big deal, and it's only four hours. I personally feel like she isn't really understanding that she signed me up to watch someone elses living creature without me consenting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologized to her because I did get a bit dickish towards the situation, but I still feel like I am in the right here with not being okay with being signed up for something like this. I mean, imagine if I told her that I signed her up to watch a friend of mines, who she had never met, child. But she shouldn't be mad because its ONLY 4 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation is mostly dissolved and I'll be watching the pupper, but was I wrong for being a bit pissed about this?\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

We shared interests in Memes, television series like The Office and Brooklyn Nine Nine. We had some Highschool courses together and after a semester became best friends. We were very talkative together and brought out eachothers sense of dark humour. We started talking on Facetime almost daily, hanging out at school, and on lunch breaks. I had a crush on her, but as I said I was **very** shy about things that can blow up and make me uncomfortable. Halfway through the year one of her friends attempted suicide in school. This was very scary for me and I have necrophobia (irrational fear of death). Later on I mention how I can not deal with the topic of death and ESPECIALLY suicide (Important to remember). I say that I had thought her friend wascute but the stress would kill me, I would also think it was my fault no matter what. We change topics and continue talking the rest of the night. Summer rolls around and she starts saying that she wants to tell me something, but is scared of me becoming awkward. She continues avoiding the point and I get pissed off and I Ghost her for the next day. She says later on that she liked me (I had the feeling) we talk about it and I say, \"I want a relationship with you, but I am very busy for the next few months (Vacations, summer camps, and dancing classes)\". She says it will be fine and I go with it, we started dating. We talk and talk online, but I did not have time to meet because of eight hours of work and four hours of online schooling. We met up once at a location near the school and grabbed lunch and talked, it was nice. I go on the big trip which I had been looking forward to for **two years.** I leave and we text because we were keeping the relationship to us and some friends. One night halfway through my trip she sent a snapchat of her leg with a large cut through it. I knew she had trouble with depression and anxiety so I asked her what happened. She said, **\"Please don't be mad.\"** I knew exactly what she was going to say. She had cut her leg (Purposely) and her Mom was not home so she had to walk 3.2km at twelve Pm. She knew that I would not like it because of when her friend tried to end it. I was SO done with it and stopped talking until I was back. Our communication levels deteriorated until School started up again.  We talked less and less over the weeks because I felt I lost the spark, I was going to break up with her until I was told by a mutual friend that she was going through \"Hard times\" so I called her that night (knowing that it could be REALLY BAD). She said she was fine after I asked her several times so we moved on and talked about different topics. I postponed it for about two weeks until she texted me to, \"just break up with me already\" I said that I wanted too talk to her about it and she reluctantly did after plenty of asking. She thought that I did not spend enough time with her and it was true, but I had told her that I was REALLY BUSY. I said I was very sorry but I think we should break up. I wanted to stay friends, but she said to, \"stop pitying me\". She blocked me and then ended all our communications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have thought of this ever since. I feel guilty but thier was a part of me that felt she was started all the problems. I would like to hear all of your opinions because maybe it will be less of my thoughts day to day and because I am returning to normal school soon (I did an outdoor program away from the school). \n\nThanks.",

            "input": "AITA for considering breaking up with my girlfriend over lack of sex? Been with this girl for a year, at first things were great. We were affectionate, both confessed our love for each other, had sex all the time. During this time though she would always say that she wasn't an affectionate person and that she had never been this affectionate with any previous partners. Ended up moving out of my flat to stay at her parents house while a flat she bought at auction was getting work done on it, and the plan is to move in there after. Still had sex often but not as much as when I lived alone (understandable living with parents) but we did still have sex. \n\nFast forward to now. No sex for 3 months. we argue every time I bring it up. She's told me she thinks its the contraceptive pill she's been on, but its the same one she's always taken and Ive researched this and its highly unlikely to be the case. Now she says she's just too tired all the time. but hasn't gone to the doctors (she says she has been too busy with work and the flat).  She is not affectionate anymore. When i've brought this up and said I don't feel loved anymore she's adamant that she loves me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter two months of no sex I suggested blow/hand jobs if she wasn't in the mood because I was just horny all the time. I was called selfish and the idea got thrown out pretty quick and more arguing ensued. I trust her fully and 100% don't think she's cheating, she has some of the best morales I've ever seen in a person which is one of the reasons I love her. If I knew it was due to a health issue/problem I would 100% stand by her and try get through it together. But having no explanation, and cant talk with her calmly about it without arguing because she gets so defensive is making me really unhappy in the relationship. There has been no intimacy in 3 months and its killing me, taken all the fun from the relationship, and its like she doesn't care anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo was thinking this weekend to meet up, go out and at the end of the night try it on. If i get the usual reply, give her a sort of ultimatum... something like \"I love you, but the lack of sex is ruining our relationship, I don't feel as close to you, I don't feel loved, and I don't feel like you care about whats going on. I don't know how long i can stick around feeling like this.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you need more info can answer questions in the comments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This is something she hasnt gotten because of fear or dying in a fiery crash ( she has never been in a crash.

I had to drive for groceries and or D.r. appointments hers and my children. \n\nThis time has really made me angry and bitter really at the fact that she refuses to be more independent.

My friend was ecstatic and they said they would immediately start research. A few days passed and I heard nothing, so I listed a few cities. The only input I got was \u201cno beach\u201d. A few more days went by and I was researching more on the day after Christmas and texted them and they said \u201cYeah, choices are hard.\u201d That apparently lit a fire under their ass and they started research themselves - and I continued. We decided on a city about a 3 hour drive that had free outdoor events and fireworks. The only issue is we have a dog...and our dogs daycare is closed, the only family we have lives in a 1.5 hour trip one way south of the direction we\u2019re going, and do not have anyone near who can check on him while we go. I however feel like I made it clear that the dog had to come with us or something and they started to get mad about that and cancelled the whole trip even though we had a pet friendly hotel with a downtown view ready. They said he\u2019s the best dog ever but he\u2019s just going to be in the car for 3 hours, and left in a strange hotel. He\u2019s not their dog to worry about, he travels constantly, and I\u2019m the one who invited them to our plans. This was all my planning, my car, my paying etc. They also asked if my SO was coming, like he would stay behind on NYE/NYD to watch the dog for us.  The whole thing just put a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nSo the following day we discuss again and there are some events around our city that are astronomically expensive I feel like for it to be meh and no real food or fireworks. They wanted to go to these events and I said no, because I don\u2019t want to pay that money for something like that in my own city. We looked around for free events before realizing that we had been invited to a massive house party by my SOs fraternity brothers. Kegs, fireworks, beer pong, a real throwback ha. They are friends with a few of them so I sent them the info and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m not really impressed by them and I don\u2019t want to ring in the New Year with a bunch of strangers so I\u2019m going to skip out\u201d. I didn\u2019t respond for awhile and they clarified that they didn\u2019t mean it in a mean way, but they\u2019re just socially uncomfortable so I responded by letting them know again they know people there, I don\u2019t know anyone either, it\u2019s be strangers if we did anything else and I wasn\u2019t gonna let them talk themselves out of New Years and they\u2019re an awesome person. I even said we could drive separately and you could leave whenever, or we could spend some time there and at a free event too. It\u2019s been over 24 hours and no response. \n\nI know they\u2019re going through some stuff right now, and I feel like I tried to be supportive but I really feel like a dick because I invited them along and it\u2019s all fallen through.

A peculiarity of my SO is their family weak spot. If their family requests money, then bam... money is given away, if their family DOES NOT ask for money but call my SO directly and say ''I need to pay some bills'', then my SO takes it as a queue indicating that money has to be given.   \n\n\nMy SO has told me stories about how there was a necessity to start working at 16 and helping family when a money shortage was in place, but instead my SO's debit, credit or Groceries card (we receive Grocery Bonus cards that allows us to pay for groceries on top of our regular paycheck, super normal here) were taken away by their family so they could manage the expenses, instead. Long story short, when my SO gave them the credit card to fix a car problem they never paid the debt back and ruined my SOs credit score, we moved in together soon after that, but my SOs family keeps demanding money passive aggressively by guilt tripping my SO.   \n\n\nA couple of days ago, my SO received a yearly Christmas bonus which is given by law in our country which was used to buy a much needed laptop for school and still had money to spare for other expenses. My SO came back home one day and this statement came up while we were talking about our day: ''I saw mom and gave her 500bucks'' I was appalled and just responded with a ''WHAT?, WHY?'' and the only response I got was ''She said she needed money''. I said it was very inconsiderate to just give 500 bucks away without checking with me first.. not because it's only my SOs money, but because we are a couple and not taking financial decisions together has often caused hardships with our budget. Realizing there was nothing we could do and how money was lost, I let it go and kept doing my daily things.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, today my SO came back home and said ''I need to go to home depot and buy Christmas Ornaments and lights'' and I asked how come since we didn't have a plan to buy a Christmas tree.. and my SO said ''My mother asked me to buy them because she wants to put up a tree and have my niece see her first Christmas Tree''. I snapped at that moment and said it was a stupid decision to take yet again without checking in with me to see if I was okay with it or not, specially after giving 500 dollars away which I know we are never getting back and how money keeps being throw away and that's why we've been having so many issues with bills lately. I let my SO know that they should just stop spending money without telling me about it because of all the bad decisions that are being taken recently concerning money.  \n\n\nI explained that their family is being incredibly inconsiderate for asking money time after time, and it's not our fault my mother in law doesn't have a job and doesn't want to get a job worth a damn and we should not cover her needs in spite of having a husband who should be taking care of her instead of asking my SO to budget in expenses that do not belong to us. I told my SO to talk to my mother in law and tell her to get a damn job instead of leeching off a couple who is trying to get married and stop asking for money all the time. My SO refused, so I called my mother in law and tried to talk to her by saying we can't give any more money and how she should have thought twice before blowing out the 500 my SO gave her.   \n\n\nNeedless to say, it is kind of a shit storm, but I am just way too tired of my SOs family taking advantage of my SO, and my SO not accepting how these decisions are being taken way to lightly and as a couple, we should BOTH be taking them.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? :/ ",

I lived in PA while he lived in UT. Well I eventually moved in and across the country with him after we discussed it and in doing this, I was disowned from my entire family. I didn't have a job (I had quit it to move and the move was rather sudden planned on moving in May and I ended up moving 2 months earlier than I planned). So I started volunteering at the local Aquarium to keep me busy as I looked for a job. It had taken me 5 months to find a decent job here in Utah. During that time I was trying but there wasn't much to do in science without a PH.D in academia. He comes from a family of very good means (his mom has fuck you money) and his mother constantly berated me for not having a job and she told him that he should protect himself from being taken advantage of and I should have gotten a temp job in between while looking. He had told me that frankly I didn't need to work, and he wanted me to go to a place where I would be happy. Eventually I found a good job in R&amp;D for a pharma company and we finally started to pull ahead financially from me moving in. He proposed to me about a month ago and we are genuinely happy for one another. I honestly feel as if I am the luckiest girl alive and am greatful for him every day for just coming into my life. \n\nThe problem: He recently was offered a significant promotion, which would require us to move to Seattle. His mother lives in Seattle. I don't want to pidgenhole him in his carrier and he would be climbing essentially 4 management positions (from middle management to just below the CFO). I don't think I could bare to have 0 support surrounding me and I have issues making friends due to my childhood (I shut down and don't talk a lot) so I havent made very close friends here in UT. We talked it over and I wouldnt have to work, and can finally persue my goal of going for a PH.D. The only thing I'm worried about is him or his mother thinking I am taking advantage of him. He really is a blessing in my life, he helped me when I really didn't think I was ever going to live past my 30s. I would need to be out of work for a year before I would start school again. And would be applying in December this year for fall 2020.  WIBTA if I quit my job to persue a doctorate? I don't want to take advantage of him. ",

I said yes because he is my favorite teacher and it would get me out of a class I don't like. Anyway this semester he decided that instead of just band preforming that he would combine the work of all the classes he teaches into one event displaying k-6 Art, High school digital media, and theatre. This means that my involvement in the event would be increased alot from basically nothing to some of my photography being auctioned off to raise funds to support the programs, playing in the band and even preforming as a lead in a minor theatre skit. \n\nIn previous semesters my only involvment in these things was basically as an assistant helping when needed doing whatever it takes to make the event run smoother. I never did any actual performing. I never told my parents that they should come to these preformances. This semesters program rolls around and I dont tell them anything other than that I am helping out and I'll catch a ride home from a friend as usual. Then today I was tagged in a few pictures on Facebook from the preformance by friends from the class and because my parents follow me on Facebook they saw the pictures and where upset and \"hurt\" that I didnt invite or tell them what I was actually doing that night. \n\nSome background Info on my reasoning for not telling them- My parents are typically hermits who dont like to leave the house unless they need to. Then during previous events they are always pressuring me to leave asap or not wanting to go at all and in general just ruining the experience for me. One example is last years awards night at my school where they announce the winners of the student council elections and because I ran for office it was required that I be there then half way through my mom gets a headache and decided that we had to leave right then and there. I refused because I put alot of effort into my campaign and If I left it would forfeit. I won but got my ass chewed for making them wait twenty minutes. Then during my classes  photography showing they didnt make it because they were to tired. Then the worst event is when my school held a \"fasfa night\" to help teach seniors how to apply for student loans going into college and naturally parents were required for the event. They were irritated afterwards because we could have technically done it from our house. So after that I decided to save my self the stress and stop involving them in things. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n",

Also no tdlr because there's really no way to sum this up cleanly.\n\nTo start I'd like to describe my two friends here.\n\nA, is a former close friend of my sister who I've known for over 10 years but only really got close to around 5 years ago. The type of close where nearly everyone we knew thought we were dating for at least a moment. We often say that we're platonic soulmates. They've always been a Mom Friend who gives everything they can to people without getting anything in return.\n\nB, is a friend I met via a chatroom online also around 5 years back. However I've really only been close to her when she started dating A around 2 years ago. She's had a lot of rough shit happen to her over the years and really the main support for our friendship is that I'm a removed party for her to vent to.\n\nI introduced the two through that chatroom 5 years ago when I added A to the group so I'd know someone there better, and the two ended up meeting irl and deciding to date long distance in spring 2016.\n\nAnyway enough set up here.\n\nFor the longest time A has expressed a wish for their relationship to become more physical. B was not comfortable with that, and A fully respected that, and didn't press on it. However B would regularly allude to being interested in that, only to back down when A would bring it up. This wasn't to big of a deal, A would regularly bring this frustration up with me and another one of our friends who is better at relationship advice. A fully respected B's choices with her body and wasn't going to push her into something. B had also expressed discomfort with a more open relationship when A brought that up, and A respected that as well.\n\nThe long short was that A was very sexually frustrated, which they could deal with. And it was never something they felt they were owed, or pushed on.\n\nThe second factor was emotional. As I briefly stated A has a very giving personality. They'll hold you and let you give your life story and support you, even if they're falling apart. This is something I've seen them put themself through time and time again. While B is much more of a taking personality. Around 80% of one on one communication between B and me, is B complaining about her friends, expressing insecurities, and being generally needy. As I have also stated  B has had a lot of bad shit happen to her in friendships and relationships. So I get where this neediness comes from, even though she seems blind to it.\n\nThat led to a relationship that was basically A taking care of all of B's emotional needs while ignoring any stress or issues they were dealing with. This wasn't B's fault alone, A knows they do this. But it was still a very unbalanced relationship.\n\nA had intent to cut things off after the holidays because they didn't want to ruin the holidays for B. I supported them in this and let them know I'd still be close to both them and B.\n\nThat plan tanked though. A had been hanging out with a friend, and while I was not present, what happened was that their friend allowed A to Have that emotional vunrability that they'd been denying themself, and the pair kissed briefly before A snapped back and realised what they were doing.\n\nThat night A thouroughly ran themself through the mud, and came to the conclusion that they needed to tell B right away in the morning. Which they did, and did not ask for forgiveness or to remain friends.\n\nNow a few weeks later I'm left in the awkward position as a mutual friend to each.\n\nToday B made a dramatic post in our original groupchat we met in to announce to everyone that the couple was no longer a couple and that A had cheated. And while I do respect that it's B's business, I can't shake the feeling it was more of a show. Given that B has made posts on all of her social media everyday about how betrayed she feels. All the social media where she knows A will see it.\n\nAnd really I'm reaching the end of my wits here. I've always been firmly a \"cheaters are scum\" type of person, but I can't help but believe A isn't the sole party at fault. Am I the asshole for thinking B is partially at fault for how this all ended? Would I be the asshole for calling her out?",

K is the sister of one of B, who is one of my decently good friends, certainly not best, but we hang out every week or two, used to do so a lot more, and have always been very friendly and open. He very rarely mentions his sister so I don't know the feelings he might harbor towards her or how protective he is. That being said, within that friend group there is an ongoing joke about them wanting to hook up with my sister, wanting to make moves on her, and even going so far as to slide into her DM's. B has participated fairly minimally in this, but still has made the extremely occasional comment and laughed at the jokes.\n\nI'm currently talking to/hanging out with a few girls, and just kinda taking things as they go after getting hurt by numerous girls after catching feelings too soon a few times last semester, and certainly do not think K is looking for anything super serious and is doing the same thing somewhat.

This course was notified early on that there would be a group project worth 65% of our grade and that we should pick 1 - 2 partners accordingly. I asked one of brothers who I will call M to join my group since I know he's a smart person and we were friends. He agreed to be my partner and I thought that was the end of that. The project gets released a month later and it turns out M asked another fraternity brother to join our group and now it's a three person project. The projects difficulty scales according to how many people are in each group. I was surprised but he assured me it was no big deal and that we would be fine. Fast forward to a week before the deadline and zero progress had been made by the other two partners and I had done a fair amount of the starting work. Decided to hit them up and tell them we need to finish it as it's a large chunk of our grade. We meet up lets say on a monday and nothing was really done so I decided to go home and complete it on my own. I didn't end up completing it but luckily it got extended by three days. Great, I hit up my partners again and they both claimed they'd work on it again.... nothing had been done. The last day i'm scrambling to get even a 40% of the marks, but i did not finish. I e-mailed my professor after he had graded it (as i got a 20/100 originally). He emails all three of us to come to his office hours and to present the project, we all agreed today to go. But yet again the same theme, I'm the only one who went. I cannot possibly pass with a grade under a sixty ( The weight of the project is way too big), and I fail I would have to take another semester, pay thousands of dollars, and retake the course so I decided to tell him that I did the majority on my own and that I wanted it to be graded as a single person project instead of a three person. He ended up settling on giving me an eighty instead of a forty five.\n\nTLDR: Did entire project on my own, screwed over friends to save my grade and to graduate on time.\n\nThis happened earlier today and these guys are my friends (though not really that close). I feel really guilty but I did what I had to do in my opinion, my other two friends contributed nothing significant at all.

So he didn't pay his rent for the month of January until the second last day of the month (just rent; no utilities share) and after constant reminders. He's on a Fulbright scholarship and well-off enough to visit his home at the end of every semester. I'm also an international graduate student but I haven't been able to afford the tickets for the last two years so you can do the math.\n\nAnyway, for this month (Feb) I deducted his skipped utilities' share as well as the current bills and he made a big mess out of it. For electric, the service period was from Nov. 29 to Dec. 31 so he technically used the utilities for 14 days. He used gas for 12 days for the (Dec. 1 -31 period). Besides, he had a guest over before he left that stayed for five days. He stays mostly at home (Masters student with no RA duties) and me being a doctoral GRA go out in the morning and sometimes return at midnight. Still, I've always shared half of the utilities despite him being the majority user. Based on the latest spar, I'm thinking to replace him. Will that be a good idea?",

Now at age 20, I'm feeling a lot better and I'm able to move on with my life, college etc. I go to college about 4 hours away from my hometown and honestly I wanted to go farther. I hate the town I grew up in due to just my experience there. When I come back there it just puts me in a bad mood and my family doesn't make it better. My oldest sister (24) has bad anger issues and when she's angry I get the most of it. My mam is also dealing with a lot of bad stuff right now and it's safe to say she is not mentally okay. I seem to be the only one to notice and I try to help her by suggesting counselling and other methods but that's all I can do.  I find it hard to stay at home for long periods of time for these reasons.\n\n\n\nWhat happened: I'm off of college this whole week. My best friend is about to go on placement for college and I won't be able to see her until September. Because of this, she was going to visit me in college and I was going to visit her. We planned to get drunk, dance and generally have a good time (note: this is legal as I'm for Europe ;) ). She came to visit me a few weeks ago (which is the first time I saw her in months) and I was going to meet her today. Everything was set until mam this morning decided that I was no longer allowed to go. 1- I am 20 and 2- this has been planned a while ago I can't just cancel. I got angry about this and asked her to give me a valid reason and I would drop it. She claimed I had study to do because I was so busy with study yesterday (spent 5 hours studying). I don't see the logic but idk. She then drops on me that I am affecting her mental health. I was honestly floored by this statement and made me extremely upset. I then finished the argument by saying 'fine I'll leave and won't come back until the semester is over'. (1st of June for me). I think I went too far with that statement but I honestly think it's the best option for me at this point. I did not get to see my best friend at the end of it all.\n\n\n\nSo am I the asshole? I honestly have no clue at this point.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!",

She lives with my aunt atm and pays $600 for a 1br, parking, utilities, internet, and laundry included. Last week my sister and her bf, who have a toddler together, got into it. Their relationship was already hanging on a thread because they just couldn't make things work. Her bf is very irrational and vindictive and my sister is very stubborn and proud. Well, he ended up kicking both her and their son out of their apt.\n\nMy mother invited my sister to stay at my aunts house given the situation and because all happened so fast neither of them reached out to my aunt to ask if it were alright. When my aunt found out she exploded. Gave my sister a month, max. She then blatantly told my mother that she needed to find a new place. My mother constantly had issues with my grandmother, who is also living in my aunts house and being supported by her as well. This always put my aunt in a stressful position as mediator. \n\nWhen I heard the news I was devastated. My husband and I offered to help my family as much as we could. My sister was lucky enough to find a room for rent with a family friend for $500, but my mother has little to no option and is even considering sleeping in her car. My husband and I both asked her to consider moving into a 2br and that she would have to pay $800 and watch our 10 month old when necessary so I could possibly work or go back to school, but she said she couldn't afford it. She then exclaimed that we should give her a discount for watching the baby. \nWhen we couldn't come to an agreement she asked us to compromise and get a 1br so she could sleep in the living room at less than what shes paying at my aunts. Neither of us wants to give up our privacy. \n\nMy husband and I are both in the culinary industry, so living in the city is necessary for us. We make just enough to get by here and in the future if the opportunity presents it self we will relocate to somewhere more inexpensive, but this is our life at the moment and we arent being pushovers. \n\nAITA? \n",

My mom's boss usually has gotten books / comics drawn for him to understand why these things are happening to him.\n\nMy mother's boss, knowing I'm an artist, asked my mother if I could draw something for her son's upcoming eye surgery.

I was confused, and expressed concern about doing such a thing when I'm a full-time student. I was told that she \"expected something of me now\". \n\nI just got an email from her boss yesterday detailing the project. She wants me to draw roughly 20 panels of art for her son's surgery. I became rather irritated with this, considering I never gave explicit consent to working on this thing. I went to my mom, telling her that I felt this way, especially considering I am being offered *nothing* in exchange for doing this.\n\nMy mother's response was that she thinks I should just do this out of the \"kindness of my heart\", and that she supposes we just have \"different morals\".

I dont mind it, he lives close by anyway. Not once have I asked him to pay for gas or pay for anything of mine. This time I asked for gas money because I was borrowing my dads car and he wanted me to pay him for gas and he offered 5 bucks which didnt even pay for the gas we used, but I was cool with it.\n\nWe went out and discovered that we had to pay for parking which was 5 bucks. I didnt have cash or debit card on me to get out cash and it's a cash lot. If I did have cash on me I would pay it no problem, you got gas, I'll get parking. So I told him to get it and he goes \"no that is not what was agreed upon. I'm sorry but I didnt agree to pay for this. If I'm getting gas you have to get parking.\" Well neither did I, and if I knew we had to pay for parking I would have bought cash, but I didnt. So I told him that I dont have cash or a debit card so I cant pay. He doesnt have cash on him but does have a debit card, but he reiterates adding he has bills to pay. \n\nThis dude makes 53k a year, and I never ask him for anything but this one time I asked him to spot me, he tells me no. Anyway I tell him \"dude it's not like this is an everyday thing. If I had the money I would pay it, but I dont so either we drive home and you give me gas money or you pay for parking and we meet our friends.\" Its like literally 10 bucks total that I'm asking him to pay, literally not breaking the bank. \n\nAnyway he refuses so we look around and we find street parking and we park there, and I'm a little tense and keep worrying about my car because I'm not 100% sure if were able to park there, I actually went to check on the car while we went from one bar to another to make sure I didnt get a ticket. (Btw while we were at the club he bought a drink. I think its oddly suspicious if you throw such a fit over 5 bucks because you dont have the funds, but buy yourself a 10 dollar drink. That made me realize that he did have money but he didnt want to help me out even though I needed it). \n\nI never do favors to get anything back, and had I had the cash, I would have paid for parking myself no problem no questions asked because that's just how I am.

She hasn\u2019t menstruated in four years. \n\nLast April I came home from a show and was greeted with three positive pregnancy tests. We were ecstatic, got engaged, began preparations to have a family. We went to a cadre of specialists and learned we were four or five months along, which wasn\u2019t totally unsurprising given a lack of periods. \n\nThe next month we miscarried and we both took it rather hard. We had a mourning period, but by June I thought we\u2019d processed our grief. Then my fianc\u00e9 asserted that she was still pregnant. \n\nHer belly had not receded and still looked five or six months pregnant. It wasn\u2019t fat (she\u2019s quite active and eats well), but a hard pregnancy bulge. I am skeptical but support her assertion. \n\nWe go to five more specialists between June and August, all of whom say they can\u2019t account for the abdominal tissue but ultrasounds, low HCG, and urine tests all disconfirm the possibility of a pregnancy. My fianc\u00e9 is not dissuaded and continues to tell friends and family she is with child. I am now genuinely worried. \n\nBy September, she writes off any further clinical testing and the medical community at large. She begins speaking exclusively with doulas and midwives on Internet groups; looking into cryptic pregnancies, twisted uteri, delayed implantation. Our relationship is strained. \n\nHer physical symptoms do not recede and she continues to tell anyone who\u2019ll listen that she is due any day now. She stops going to our joint activities and lines our furniture with plastics in preparation of childbirth. She researches home birthing and begrudges me for not doing the same. \n\nWe fight. I tell her that I believe her symptoms are psychogenic. I believe that her desire for maternity has produced a phantom pregnancy. These mostly occur in women who\u2019ve lost a pregnancy between 33 and 35 years of age. My fianc\u00e9 is 34. She accuses me of calling her crazy, and I tell her the subconscious mind longing for a child is very sane, but she considers my disbelief an insult. \n\nShe begins to justify her extended pregnancy in odd ways, saying that she herself was a 52 week pregnancy (she wasn\u2019t), that some pregnancies can carry to well over a year (they can\u2019t), and that we\u2019ll be millionaires once we sue the hospitals who\u2019ve misdiagnosed the pregnancy (we won\u2019t). I refute these claims, as the longest pregnancy ever was three months beyond nine, and try to use her logic (potential harm to herself and the fetus beyond nine months) as a way to reintroduce my fianc\u00e9 to proper medical care. She refuses it. \n\nThe first week of December we have a midwife in our home who brings a sonogram and fetoscope, hears nothing, and again disconfirms a pregnancy. I tell the midwife my theory and the midwife finds it plausible. My fianc\u00e9 consents that she is not pregnant. \n\nUntil the holidays, when she tells both me and our entire extended family that she still feels kicks, has bloody mucilage, and has been talking with a midwife 150 miles from our home who has seen this kind of thing all the time. It goes over as well as it sounds. I am both horrified and exasperated. I tell her this is verging on 52 weeks and she tells me some pregnancies can reach 1.7 years. \n\nShe schedules an appointment with this new midwife and announces that I cannot come with her as I am too rife with negativity. I drive my fianc\u00e9 to the midwife\u2019s home - an apartment in a questionable area of a questionable city - and fill the hour by trying to find a whisky I\u2019ve been looking for. \n\nI am hoping this woman will see the desperation and as gently as possible tell my fianc\u00e9 she\u2019s not with child, but I pick her up and she\u2019s beaming. I should\u2019ve realized that you don\u2019t scour the Internet to find someone to validate your delusions if you aren\u2019t confident they\u2019ll be affirmed. \n\n\u201cThe midwife felt the baby and taught me how to feel it, too. She poked it and it moved from one side of my uterus to the other. She used a Doppler to hear it. She said I know my body and to believe in myself.\u201d \n\nAm I the asshole for not indulging this fantasy? \n\nUpdate: \n\nI\u2019ve asked her go to a therapist with me. She laughed and made my disbelief an issue of me not trusting her body and intuition. \n\nI told her to be wary of the cryptic pregnancy support groups that allege low HCG pregnancies that don\u2019t show up on ultrasound and can last 3-5 years are real and common. They\u2019re taking advantage of vulnerable people. She said there are hundreds of women who\u2019ve had successful births in those groups. It\u2019s cultic. \n\nShe reiterated that she heard movement and a heartbeat on the Doppler. I proposed that by now it would show up on an ultrasound and asked her to get another one for me. She refused and suggested that ultrasounds are linked to autism. \n\nAt this point she said that she would deal with the pregnancy herself since I didn\u2019t trust her and I assured her I was only concerned because I cared. She clammed up. \n\nI\u2019ve notified her family of my concerns. \n\nUpdate 2: \n\nAfter increasingly reckless behavior that led to not one, but two extremely preventable house fires (and with that behavior showing no signs of slacking), I have exited the relationship. \n\nAmong few blessings I\u2019ve had this past year were that my dog was with me on both occasions  and she and I were not harmed by smoke or flame.

I interpreted that as \u201cI over spent this month because I was expecting my return but it never happened so now I\u2019m screwed\u201d. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to \u201creward\u201d poor money management skills so I offered him a job. \n\nIt\u2019s was really simple stuff and I offered to pay him directly at the end of the week so he can pay his mom. I was 100% going to be overpaying but I wanted to give him a chance. \n\nI also gave him the option that if he came up with $150 I\u2019d match the rest and he wouldn\u2019t owe me anything.  \n\nHe told me that I wasn\u2019t \tbeing a good friend. That I was trying to \u201cmake a lesson out of him\u201d. That he came to me in his time of need and I\u2019m just trying to get him to work for me. I was offering $300 to be a glorified receptionist cause we are entering a busy period in my business. I was really frustrated that he felt that way. \n\nI told our mutual friend and he brought up that he probably asked me because it was less embarrassing than asking his new friends he made in school. I just felt used, like I was a bank account for one of my good friends. I just feel like his pride won\u2019t allow him to tell his mom he fucked up. They aren\u2019t a family in rough financial times, I know she\u2019d understand. \n\nAITA here? Him and his girlfriend seem to think so. My girlfriends neutral cause she thinks I should consider our past and understand. I just feel like we\u2019ve been drifting apart and the first time we\u2019ve talked in months is about a loan. I don\u2019t want to track down the money and get it back. Should I just give it to him? Just feels like there\u2019s a price tag on our friendship now. ",

            "input": "Ok...background first then we\u2019ll get to the meat. There\u2019s also a TLDR at the bottom for those who don\u2019t want to read all of this. For those who do...sorry. There\u2019s a lot.\n\nSo I just started my second year in college. My first year I met this guy (we\u2019ll call him Chad) who was finishing up his fourth year. He was cool to me and my friends so we decided to hang out with him a few times throughout the year. There were more than a few times he bought booze for us and was overall a swell guy. Until one night... to make a long story short, he was rubbing up on a few of my female friends\u2019 feet and being super creepy about it. It made everyone super uncomfortable, to the point that my friends said they didn\u2019t want him around at anymore parties. I agreed and we never hung out again.\n\nFlash forward a couple months, and I\u2019m at a party with a different group of friends and Chad happens to be there. He makes me some drinks, we chat and I get very drunk. At some point in the night a bunch of us are sleeping in the living room and my friend on the other end of the room jumps up from the couch and runs into the kitchen. A few of my other friends follow her and they talk in the kitchen for about an hour and come back, everyone goes back to sleep. A few weeks later, she tells me that she freaked out cuz Chad was grabbing at her feet while she was sleeping, causing her to wake up and have a panic attack. After hearing about that, my whole friend group (except one guy, we\u2019ll name him Bob) swore off hanging out with Chad since he\u2019d been acting so creepy.\n\nOk, now to the actual meat. About two months ago was my college\u2019s homecoming game. We (being me and the second group of friends) decided to have a party to celebrate and hang out. Bob volunteered to host at his apartment, and the night was set. All of a sudden, Chad shows up at the homecoming football game asking when the party is and where. Myself and six of my fiends pull Bob aside and tell him that if Chad is going to the party then the rest of us aren\u2019t. He said he\u2019d take care of it.\n\nWe get to the party. It\u2019s lit, everyone has a great time and post a bunch of pics and videos on our Snapchat stories and other social media platforms as you do when the party is lit. We all pass out feeling pretty good and not worrying about anything. However, when we wake up about 15 of us (including myself) have texts waiting for us from Chad about how we all betrayed his trust and how he can\u2019t believe that he called us his friends. He blocks everyone who was at the party on every social media he has and has his fianc\u00e9 do the same. As it turns out, when Bob said he would take care of it he meant he would tell Chad that the party was canceled and just throw it anyway. So when we put a bunch of pics online of us hanging out, Chad saw it and got pissed. He and Bob had a huge fight and weren\u2019t on speaking terms for a while. I think they\u2019ve made up now, but I\u2019m not sure. The rest of us have made no attempt to patch things up with him, and some of us are more than ok with the way that things turned out. After all, Chad was a total creep and we didn\u2019t like him.\n\nSo anyway...are we the assholes? I know Bob could\u2019ve handled that differently, but should we have made him choose between Chad and us? Was it really fair of us to put him in that position? We\u2019ve all sort of accepted that Chad isn\u2019t around anymore, and some of us like I said are pretty happy about it given his creepy vibe. We\u2019ve come to terms with what we did, but I\u2018m interested to hear some opinions from outsiders.\n\nTLDR: A guy I met last year turned out to be a total creep. We found out he was gonna be at a party we were going to, and told the host was a close friend of his to chose between us and him. He chose us, and creepy dude got pissed.",

            "input": "   I had this one friend, and we did almost everything together. Our friendship had always been really special to me, because he had always been there for me. He supported me through all of my downs, and I tried my best to do the same for him. He was even my wingman when I had a huge crush on one girl in our friend group. (No, that didn't work out but the fact he tried to help still means everything to me) He had always been there for me whenever I was feeling under-confident, upset, or whenever I just felt like I had no one to talk to. I always kind of looked up to him as a better version of myself because I felt like he was better at not letting his emotions control him. Meanwhile, I've always been the sensitive one who tends to get upset over the little things. Hell, I cried once because I saw a dead bird on my way to school. And that was in 9th grade by the way. \n\n   I was there for him too because he had problems and struggles of his own. And I feel like us constantly working to help each other, added to the quality of our friendship because we understood each other's issues. We cared about each other more than we cared about ourselves. I felt us growing really close, and I enjoyed every second of it. He yelled at any of our mutual friends whenever they were giving me a hard time.He reminded all of my friends that it was my birthday when all of them had forgotten. And I would do the same for him, but there was one problem. I'm incredibly insecure, my biggest fear is that one day all of my friends might just see me as boring, or annoying, or that they secretly hate me, and that they'll just walk out of my life. I've told him this before too, that I was afraid of being seen as annoying, and that I had abandonment issues. That I sometimes felt jealous or left out, but I also hated myself for feeling that way because I felt like I was ruining everything for everyone by being an attention whore. He said that is was fine, that he didn\u2019t mind it and that he'd always be there. \n\n   But, he had a tendency of giving the green stop sign. I'd ask him if he wanted to hang out, play video games, or do whatever and he'd say \u201cyes.\u201d Only to not do whatever we made plans to do. I always dismissed it thinking that sometimes stuff comes up, and that he does have more important things to do. But this kept happening, over and over again. Even on my birthday when we made plans to play video games and he just didn\u2019t go through with it. He said he felt bad and I believed him but, I was just kind of annoyed. We actually hung out more, and then out of the fucking blue he raged at me to leave him alone. After we mutually made plans to hang out??? I ended up leaving and then the longest 2 hours of my life passed before I did the stupidest thing I've ever done. I questioned if he cared about me, and if I was just a burden to him. He immediately apologized and I believe his apology to be genuine but, it just kind of went over my head. I dismissed his apology because at the time, I was just tired of being lied to, having promises broken, and being sent mixed signals. And me being quick to not accept his apology made him angry and then we had a very mundane argument that lasted for a few seconds before he just ended it with \u201cWe'll talk later\u201d.  I later came forward and apologized for everything because even now, I blame myself for this whole mess. \n\n   I thought we made up for it and I thought that we could just put this behind us. The next day I asked him if we were still cool and he said \u201cyes\u201d. This was 3 days after my birthday and we didn\u2019t really talk much that day, or the next day, or the next day, or the next week, and before I know it. He ghosted me for 3 weeks. And during those 3 weeks some of our mutual friends kind of got us to hang out. But it didn't really work. While I was in my self-loathing state, he was shit talking me to all of our friends. Including once to another one of my friends, right in front of me. Saying things that confirmed all of my deepest insecurities. And I had no one to blame for this but myself. I think it's safe to say he over reacted a bit, but so did I and I still feel like I could have prevented all of this. A lot of our mutual friends stayed passive but some of our friends, after hearing both sides of the story, immediately took my side. And at first it felt nice, but even some of his friends his friends that didn\u2019t know me took my side and that made me feel bad because, literally no one took his side. And I didn\u2019t want him to lose friends over this. We had one mutual friend who took my side and even said he wanted to ghost my friend, but I was the one to talk him out of it. The thing is, now my friend that ghosted me has basically replaced me with my friend who was going to ghost him, as his new best friend. \n\n   I'm posting this here because I don't know what to believe. Everyone's been telling me that I'm not at fault, but I still blame myself for it. And lately I guess I've kind of begun to blame my friend more. I often swing back and forth between feeling like it's all my fault, and feeling like my friend was a liar. I still get mixed messages from him like: He said he didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to me because he'd have felt bad about it. But why would he feel bad saying \u201cno\u201d and not feel bad ghosting me. That's why I want to know from you guys because I feel like I'm too emotionally unstable to decide myself. \n\n   \n\n   ",

We don't own a car but casually borrow a friend's and park it in our driveway. It began one night at 2am when they had a visitor parked way up the joint driveway, we had just gotten a ride back to our house (from the friend with the car we casually borrow and it was in our driveway) so the of the neighbors presumed boyfriends was the one parked way up the driveway and blocked in.

So I go to shovel and realize the neighbours just pushed through the snow in the middle of the shared driveway so I decided to shovel my half and park at the end so they needed to shovel their side to get in.

The mood was ruined completely around 10 when E just stared verbally ripping into J making her run into a different room. \n\nE explained her reason for it ( mainly it had been 3 weeks since they broke up, how dare J be 'cuddling' others in front of her, J wasn't of meant to come that night anyway, and Js aplogise for growing apart wasn't good enough) it was pretty tense and that's when someone from the other room (kat) came to get J a drink. And E forbid it! Saying J should only have coke becasue E didn't want her drinking. \n\nI left the room and headed to the other, stressed as hell. I explain to K and F that E won't let Kat bring J some rum, J gets mad and tries to go sort it out.

Everyone was done\n\nLater Kat threw up, K and JD had to clean it up. F was staring off into space. E was still going on about J and J was staying away. \nWe got Kat home and tried to calm everyone down. At around 3 I left K and F to sleep and headed for the couch where I found E, JD and JDs girlfriend still going on about the drama. I had to be up at 10 for a train. JD and her girlfriend have their own room. Only E is sleeping in the living room with me. I told them calmly I need to sleep, I had a train but they just kept going on and on.\n\nAt least use the hall way. JD went to bed at 4am, now pissed off because her girlfriend was more interested in E than helping her get J on the floor so she could get into her bed. J slept on the floor. \n\nJDs girlfriend finally went to bed at 5am and I was livid. I turned off the light went to sleep and.... was woken up every hour by E sleep talking/crying. \n\nMorning comes and I go to get dressed but the room my bags in is locked because K had a lecture. Ok. He'll be back in an hour to open the door I can just catch the next train I think. \n\nF wakes up and opens it instead and the guy looks like hell. He didn't sleep well thanks to the stress.\nI get dressed and decide I'll get the 1:41 train.. that doesn't happen \n\nF gets dressed, K gets home. JD wakes up and E has been walking around for an hour. \n\nMe, F, and K clean while E does jack shit. J gets up and also doesnt help. I need to leave now to catch my train but neither K or F can help me get to the train station till everyone is ready to go and time is ticking on. \n\nI say at least 10 times that I need to leave. K and F also say the same but apparently YouTube is more important. \n\nFinally F decides I should get a taxi to the station and say my good byes.

I didn't say it in a cruel way all i said was \"I came here to relax and hang out not deal with more unneeded stress. I also really need to leave\"\n\nI got on the train at almost 4. I won't get home till 7. My mother is end stage COPD and needs me there. I promised id get home early. They all know this. \n\nI rang someone who couldn't make it to the party and told them why i angry and they said I should look at it from Es point of view more. \nWhen I told them it looked like it could of turned violent and I was worried for Js safety  I was told I shouldn't say that and I sound like a dick. \n\nAnd then on the train I messaged K and asked if anyone was upset with what I said, he told me yes and \n\"I think everyone was annoyed and just doesn't really want to talk about it maybe?\"  \n\nNow i feel like the asshole for being upset over everything. \n\nMaybe I really should of took E perspective into account more?

This means we have to share a bathroom as my parents end up claiming 2 of them (one for both of them and another for my mom who loves makeup). My brother is a complete slob when it comes to bathroom use and he never ends up cleaning so I have to do it because I hate having a dirty bathroom. even when i complain to him or my parents he never does it (he's a little bit of a favourite). But thats besides the point, my issue is that he was diagnosed with chron's disease (which is a bowel disease which basically makes your gut uncontrollable at times) for which he takes medication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso anyways here's the real problem pepare for a bit of grossness (sorry). Evertime I go to our bathroom I have to clean off our toilet seat because somehow he gets faeces on it and who wants to sit or even look at that shit? (literally). Not only that but sometimes the faeces will end up around the toilet. Not only that but on one occassion he somehow got some on my pants in the laundry basket (low to the floor) which I then yelled at him for and got yelled at by my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case I complained to him first and he claimed it was out of his control and that he cant stop his problem. I was not to happy with the state of our bathroom and so I complained to my parents about it since he wasn't having any of it. They basically said the same thing of just try to accept it, he can't control it. I constantly get into fights with them about it because it happens non stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that my 21 year old brother should be able to control himself a little bit more properly despite his condition especially since he takes medication for it?",

I\u2019ve never wanted a kid, even at age 5 I found the idea of baby dolls etc just ugh. This idea evolved and changed as I did and eventually developed into where I am now which is even if I wanted one having one with my medical issues would just be dumb and dangerous for everyone involved. \n\nMy cousin is the eldest of us all and has always been a family woman (honest to god I see nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s just not for me) she\u2019s happily married and is expecting her first. And so the family has gone into a bit of a baby craze. \n\nI live quite far so I\u2019ve avoided most of the madness, but I went to see them all last weekend with a knitted blanket I\u2019d made for her as a gift. This started the comments: \u201cyou\u2019re obviously very mummsie think of what you could make for your own\u201d \u201cyou\u2019d be a great mum\u201d \u201cit\u2019s what you were born to do\u201d \u201coh your opinion will change when you\u2019re older\u201d \nTo all of this I just laughed and made jokes just trying to get past the awkward but it\u2019s a full 4 hours of these little gripes till my cousin says: \u201cHonestly [my name] you\u2019re so stubborn, believe me in a few years all your \u201copinions\u201d will change then that job of yours won\u2019t matter. I just hope it\u2019s not to late and you don\u2019t end up alone and bitter. Honestly having a kid is the best thing a woman can do and nothing can compare\u201d \n\nThis really angered me so I (somewhat tipsy and just kinda very done) snapped back \u201cwell sorry I have more ambition than being a breeder, have fun with a wrecked vagina\u201d she broke down crying and that pretty much put an end to the family gathering. \n\nI feel horrid about it all and I really didn\u2019t mean it. She\u2019s always wanted a family and I\u2019m so happy for her but I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve always respected her choices and she\u2019s never respected mine and it kinda popped at the worst moment. I really want to say sorry but she\u2019s now posting these really pathetic and snide fb posts and i really am just kinda tired. \n\nSmall note: my cousin and that side of the family knows about my medical conditions, I even brought them up to point out how unsafe it would be. But they still continued. I know that doesn\u2019t excuse what I did but I hope it explains why I got so angry. \n\nTDLR: at a family gathering and got crap for not wanting children, I snapped at my pregnant cousin and now she\u2019s posting all of this stuff on fb and I just want the whole ordeal to be over.

We\u2019ve been arguing recently, and the main basis of that is that my girlfriend has a few selfish and entitled tendencies, we\u2019re both women and have been together for eight years now.\n\nA small example of this is when I was working in the office the other day and ended up having to counsel a very good friend of mine through a life crisis that was urgent for about an hour and as a result I didn\u2019t get any work done. Partner enters just after I get off the phone and expresses her annoyance that I\u2019d put time into my friend instead of her, and now was going to have to spend extra time making up for it finishing my work. This is a rarity that I bring work home, I spend a *lot* of time with my partner, it was just a situation that came up. Quite obviously this is bullshit and I told her so. But this is the type of low level crap that I\u2019m having to deal with recently. My friend genuinely needed me, it wasn\u2019t trivial.\n\nSo anyway, back to the asshole moment. We\u2019re enjoying a bit of time together (last night) and I\u2019m in the act of giving her oral, I\u2019d been doing it for about fifteen minutes at this point and moved onto kissing her in other places before communicating that I wanted her to change position so I could do something a little different to her. No hurry to orgasm, I just wanted to shake it up a little. Her response?\n\n\u201cWell I was happy with you just playing with me to be honest\u201d\n\nNow this in itself isn\u2019t an issue, and usually I\u2019d be like \u201cno probs\u201d and go to town down there.

This all happened right before he met my aunt at work, they had an instant connection that began as friendship and blossomed to a full blown relationship. My aunt knew he was married and had a kid and it didn\u2019t bother her because the relationship felt so real and it sounded like he was on the edge of divorce. Well, she ended up getting pregnant and neither of them were mad or upset. I can only imagine the shit storm that was my uncle telling his wife (yes, they are still married) that he got another woman pregnant and they are actually dating. My aunt and uncle were together a year after my cousin was born (so total of 2 years at the time), but then he went back to his wife, fast forward to 2019 and him and his wife are still married and living together, but according to him they are just married because he doesn\u2019t want her to take all of his money/property and they have a younger son who\u2019s going to middle school soon. He has been telling my aunt for years that he\u2019s going to move in with her: first it was right when she got pregnant, then when his daughter graduated high school, then when my cousin would enter high school to now he doesn\u2019t even know. I\u2019ve spoken to my friends about this and it boggles my mind that no on close to my aunt has said how crazy this is!! She is a very defensive person and it\u2019s pretty scary when she gets mad, so no one wants to step on her toes. ALMOST TWENTY FUCKING YEARS. I recently watched this TED talk that defined what true love is\u2014 selflessness and compromise. The speaker outlined how (to an extent) true love is when you make sacrifices for the people you love. My aunt has sacrificed the possibility of meeting a new partner, attending events alone, the picture perfect spouse living situation and arguably her sanity while it seems he still has it all. I feel kind of funny that a random TED talk has spurred this urge in me to tell her that my uncle doesn\u2019t love her, but I think it\u2019s time. WIBTA??",

The first battle that started, is how often his girlfriend is over. The agreement was 3 nights a week. My thinking was anything over that is half the month and thats not fair to not pay anything. That's for any guest, that way I wasnt singling her out, but i've known my friend for a long time and know how he is. So of course, here comes the first battle. She starts staying 4-5 nights a week. Months of endless battles about this. My grandma is the one renting it to us, so I felt it was her decision. I didn't feel like it was my place. It pissed her off as well, but all he would do is apologize, say he understands and would do something about it. It'd get better for a couple weeks, then rinse and repeat. I eventually just gave up.

Probably still not going to approach my parents about this, but.\n\nI am a 19 y/o, living at home with my dad and stepmom and going to community college as well as working. I go to school two days a week (all day) and work 3 jobs (25+ hours a week). I also workout and try to have a balanced life.\n\nI pay for my own expenses, car payment, insurance, eating out, phone bill, etc. The only thing I do not pay for is rent and groceries for the house.\n\nI love my stepmom and dad, and I am well aware that they do a lot for me, especially my stepmom.\n\nHowever. \nI am beginning to become frustrated/overwhelmed. My parents work from home and don\u2019t leave the house very often, especially in the winter. This has caused me to turn into their errand girl. They have me get the groceries and run any errands they don\u2019t want to leave the house themselves to do. This would be fine if it was every once in a while. \n\nExample:\nYesterday I went to school from 10am-7:30pm with very little breaks in between my classes. I\u2019m exhausted at the end of it. Also add i was feeling under the weather. 7:30 rolls around and my dad asks me to go to Costco(close to my school, but 20 minutes from our home) for him to grab a computer monitor he needs, but not sure what one. This makes me have to go to Costco, FaceTime him for 10 minutes while he decides what monitor he wants, and then asks me to bring it home. All the while I\u2019m exhausted, and still not feeling well and just want to go home. \n\nThis is a common, if not daily occurrence. My parents are always asking me to go \u201chere\u201d or \u201cthere\u201d for them because I\u2019m out already or heading in that direction. A lot of the time, they don\u2019t care that they make me late or I have previously made plans. I worked a 9 hour shift last Saturday, got off at 10 and had to go grocery shopping because they wanted things before a certain sale ended. If I\u2019m the one who drove, I have to drag my friend or boyfriend to whatever asinine place my parents need me to go. This is something that my precious boyfriends (and current) have picked up on and think it\u2019s very invasive and odd/rude. I\u2019ve defended them saying they do a lot for me, so I can do some stuff for them.\n\nBut lately it\u2019s just started to become too much. Add the fact that I have homework, jobs and my own life to juggle AND the fact that they claim I don\u2019t do enough at home, it\u2019s enough to frustrate anyone. I have weekly chores, try to keep my area and bathroom clean and common areas, but I still receive texts and get told that \u201cI\u2019m doing the bare minimum\u201d and \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I do this\u201d. \n\nAm I the asshole because I\u2019m living rent free and don\u2019t want to be their errand girl?\n\n\n\n\n",

She said she liked me to. She said she wanted to make out, so we went to go do it (I had never done it before), and right before she went to kiss me, she freaked out. She said she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. I said ok. It was her last day at the camp, and apparently she felt bad for messing with me and cried in the bathroom afterwards.  \n\nWe had exchanged numbers, and we would still occasionally text. She said we could be friends and would see how it went from there. I would text her asking if she wanted to hang out, she wouldn\u2019t respond. We would have a five minute conversation every couple months. \n\nNearly a year later, I was fed up. I told her I might as well delete her number, since it seemed that she had no interest in being friends. She said she wanted to hang out. I said I was free for the next 4 days, she says she\u2019ll go ask her mum if/when she could hang out. \n\nTwo hours later, she texts me saying I have a wrong number. I ask if it\u2019s her,  she says yes. I say it\u2019s u/SpyTrain_from_Canada, she says she doesn\u2019t know a u/SpyTrain_from_Canada. I again ask if it her, by her full name.

They asked me why I didn't stand up for her and I told her that I couldn't find my voice to speak up. When they heard that they raised their voices at me and started to tell me that I used my anxiety as an excuse and I should just get over it. I was hurt to hear that and I didn't know what to do so, I told the entire story to some of my personal friends and they were furious. They later picked a fight with Amy, and she was enraged, she asked me why I would tell anyone about the encounter, I told her that I was hurt and I needed to talk to someone. She told me to get fucked and she hasn't talked to me since. I can understand why she would be annoyed at me, but what I don't understand is why she was so furious. Am I the asshole?",

I had the most amazing time in life. \n\nBut I 100% forgot about our team meeting last night.

I\u2019ve been kind to her in general these past year or so but I don\u2019t know her personally at all and quite frankly never cared to. She\u2019s been dating Ryan\u2019s brother for three years. \n\nI\u2019m at Ryan\u2019s and his brother and Michelle are over. Ryan takes a call at one point and I\u2019m left alone with Michelle in the living room. Out of nowhere she starts talking about Ryan. She starts saying he\u2019s the most manipulative person she\u2019s ever met and that he\u2019s not a nice person. She goes on about how she thinks Ryan is lazy and how her boyfriend does so much more productive things than Ryan.

His brother then confronts Michelle about it and she goes on a psychotic text rant at me threatening me that if I ever open my mouth again there will be an issue. She claims that she \u201ccan\u2019t respect me and barely tolerates me\u201d and also that since she\u2019s known them longer than me that I\u2019m \u201cturning her friends against her\u201d She also blocks me on all of social media. \n\nShe\u2019s 25 years old and I\u2019m only 20 (we\u2019re both college graduates as are our boyfriends) it\u2019s ridiculous she\u2019s acting so goddamn immature.

            "input": "For some background, I have been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half.\n\nIt was my girlfriend's birthday on Friday. I had planned to suprise her that night with a dinner and cake at my place. She got off work early that day, and had made plans to catch up with one of her friends for a coffee to celebrate her birthday before coming over to my place. Her friend (who I will call Ally) was one of her longtime closest friends who now lives on the other side of the country for work, meaning they don't see each other very often.\n\nNow I am not close to Ally, nor do I know her very well, but I have spoken to her before while they were on Skype, and she definitely knows that my girlfriend and I are together. Anyway, I am sitting at home on her birthday a few hours before she is coming over, and I get a text from her saying that she probably won't be able to make it to my place because Ally had organised a suprise birthday dinner for her.\n\nNow I was a little annoyed since I had already bought the stuff to make dinner, but I hadn't cooked anything yet so no big deal. I texted back asking her what time everyone was getting there, and she said everyone was already there and it had already started. I said I would come and join them for dinner and she said that the reservation was only enough for the people who RSVP'd. I told her I hadn't heard about it which is why I didn't RSVP. I figured it could have just been a miscommunication, so I asked her to check with Ally.\n\nI already know I'm probably an asshole for prodding as to why I didn't get invited, but I was just feeling a bit frustrated. A while later in the evening she texted me back that Ally didn't think to invite me because she doesn't really know me well and the dinner was supposed to be more of a get together of their old girl friends group from school. I was still a little annoyed that I had an evening organised, but I felt better knowing that it was more of a get together for her friends group.\n\nI told her to have fun and arranged to meet her the next day to bring her birthday cake over. I didn't hear from her the rest of the night, so I texted her in the morning to ask how her night was. She said it was fun and that Ally would be joining us today for cake. I asked who ended being at the dinner. I was pretty upset to find out that on top of her old friends group, all of their partners attended the dinner, including Ally's fiance. \n\nEven more upsetting she said that one of her friends boyfriend who originally couldn't make it arrived later in the evening, and the server squeezed in an extra chair for them at the table. I asked why she didn't let me know when she saw this so I could come, and she said she just 'forgot'.\n\nAt this point I was pretty upset and I bailed on plans to see her that day. Mostly because I was angry at Ally for not telling me and I didn't want to talk to her, but also because I was upset at my girlfriend for not seeming to care that I wasn't there. I ended up eating most of the cake I made for her out of spite, which I feel bad about and know I shouldn't have done that.\n\nWe haven't really spoken much at all since yesterday, as she is spending today with Ally again before she fly's home. I am still feeling bad for bailing on her and eating the cake without her, and I might end up making her a new one. But at the same time I feel so annoyed that I was seemingly purposely not told about her party. This may be me sounding entitled but if anyone should have their SO invited to a suprise party it should be the birthday girl, and I kind of expect I should have been invited considering everyone else's partners got invited.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr: Girlfriend had a suprise birthday dinner thrown for her and I wasn't invited, even though everyone else's partners were invited. Am I the asshole for expecting I should have been invited?\n\nUPDATE 1: We have been texting each other and I told her I have been upset with the whole birthday situation. Ally and her fiance have gone back home and my girlfriend and I have agreed to meet up tomorrow sometime to talk things out\n\nUPDATE 2: Sorry for the delayed update, was meaning to post it and I forgot.\n\nI met up with my gf and we had a serious discussion about things. I told her I was not upset about her cancelling our plans for her birthday, I am upset about not being invited or informed by Ally, and I am quite hurt that she didn't seem to care that I wasn't there.\n\nShe agreed that Ally should have included me but defends her actions because she doesn't really know me and she already knows most of her other friends partners from school and before she moved away.\n\nI told her I was upset because she didn't want me the there. She denied it and said she would have wanted me there but she felt it wasn't her place to go making demands at a party that was organised for her. she admitted she lied about forgetting to text me when the other guy showed up late because she was nervous about upsetting Ally and coming off as ungrateful.\n\nI told her that it hurt me because I felt like I was unwanted at the party by everyone there, and that if she considers us a serious relationship I expect to at least be invited to these types of events that are special to her. She said she does consider us a serious relationship with a future together but did not realise something like this was such a big deal to me, and has promised moving forward to put me first in situations like this. I know she is particularly close to Ally so I can understand why she might have got all wrapped up with spending time with her.\n\nI feel a lot better have talking it out with her, and I trust her so I believe that she means what she said. That said, the responses in this post pointed out some signs to look out for, and I will be keeping an eye out for any more of these in the future. I am optimistic that she truly means what she said and I believe if a situation like this happens in the future she would handle things differently. I am looking forward to continuing to build a future with her.\n\nThanks everyone for the responses.",

I ask Friend X whether it is Friend Y, and Friend X gives me no information and asks that I \"act as if he never told me anything,\" which, to me, seems like a literally impossible task, especially given that I am somewhat interested in Friend Y.  In order to figure out whether or not it is truly friend Y, I ask Friend Z, who knows Friend Y.  Friend Z reveals to me that it is actually them, and feels irritated (though not too angry) at Friend X for partially leaking their secret.  Friend X is now upset with me, because he told me to act as if nothing had happened.  AITA for bringing the situation up with Friend Z?",

In the beginning, we were introducing each other and we were cool. However, throughout the year, one of the suite mates started sleeping over at his girlfriends place the majority of the time.

I\u2019m talking dishes in the sink, oily and dirty stove tops, and chunks of food left around the counter top from scraps.

I love him, but at the same time, there are incidents that are pushing me away from him. And though I try to push my feelings away from them, I still dwell on the hurt it causes. \n\nIn the past, the arguments will start over college. I am obsessive with what I want to do in the future, but never talked to him about it after he got mad at me for switching my plans suddenly. He is a year ahead of me in school, and will be graduating after this year. I did get frustrated and confused on why he gotten mad, but I also know from how he was raised by his family. When I thought he was actually finished with the college situation, he would tell his parents, who doesn't like college, and his mom would say how she went through college but wasn't able to do anything and how useless it was. It happen once, and that passed, until he asked my family to talk about it. I got that information from my mom who supports my relationship, and my decision. Later, he made me uncomfortable by saying that he was going to take a years break and look for a house to live in while I am going to college, which he got mad after I told him I did not want too.\n\nAfter we moved past with that, the problem he had was my plans to work with the FBI. For a while now it has been my dream, and something I feel like I need to do. I am aware of risks with it, which he needs to bring up when he talks about it, and I am working with my issues I know I need to sort out before joining. He before had begged me to not pursue the career, and asked me to chose between family or business. My final straw though was having his sister lecture me in her car. He had asked her if she knew I was going to join the FBI. While I was uncomfortable he watch me, but didn't help me.\n\nThe last point is that he has been very clingy. I can be clingy I admit, but at the same time, I am trying too work on it. He keeps pushing me to spend time with him, especially on the weekends when I want to spend time with my friends and family. With him pushing me though, and pushing on subjects I don't particularly want to talk about, I don't want to spend time with him any more. It feels suffocating and I need room to breath. I went through the last of my patience with him Saturday. I got sick with a pain in my side, and had to leave school early because of it. When he asked me if I could come over, and I told him no. He told me \"You didn't have to hurt yourself if you didn't want to see me\". I have been struggling with self-harm and been trying to recover. This triggered a lot of memories for me, and the pain of my side wasn't helping me. I did not talk to him for the rest of the day. This makes me really not want to see him anymore, and he doesn't seem to understand why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to spend time with my BF because of my emotions towards the issues we had?\n\nEdit: I talked it out with him. We made up, and I apologized for the issues and how I was going to work on it. He agreed, and we are both going as strong as ever. I realize that it was my fault for dwelling on the situations. And I am working on it with help.",

            "input": "So a couple of years ago my gf (22f) moved in with me (23m) in my apartment, it is pretty small but OK for 2 people. I work and make decent money but nothing to break the bank, she works in mostly cash-in-hand pub work and therefore doesn't make a lot of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a year and a half ago my gf got a dog. Now I really don't like dogs because I was bitten pretty badly as a kid and had a kind of irrational fear of them. I wasn't scared of the dog she got because it was a small pug. I told her when she got it that I am not looking after it, I am pretty busy in my life and really don't have time or any love for this animal. I really don't like this dog living in my apartment but I love my girlfriend so I don't moan. The thing wrecks my head, the constant snorting and wheezing, the begging for food, the constant need for attention drives me up the wall. I use the \"give a shit\" scale with my girlfriend when deciding which battles are worth fighting, so these things don't affect me enough to argue about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after she got it, the dog started having health problems. As someone has never owned a dog I didn't realise that these animals had so much issues (I looked it up and its common for those breeds of dogs). Initially I thought its because she never walks the dog and it is stuck in an apartment all day with her, so any illnesses she gets she would give it to the dog. I looked this up online too and its a load of bullshit, essentially the breed of dog has so much issues because it has been bred to be mentally deficient so that they are \"cute and docile\". Thing is honestly one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. The dog has had surgery about 3 times so far and the money involved is insane. I have always refused to pay for them as I don't see it as my responsibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo down to the issue that has me and my gf fighting, the dog needs surgery on its face for some respiratory issues or some shit. She came to me crying saying she couldn't afford it but I said why did you get a dog like this if you couldn't afford it. She called me an asshole for not caring about her dog but I just told her to go fuck herself. She left the other day and took her dog with her, now she is staying in her parents house. I assume she will guilt trip her dad (who doesn't make much money either) to pay for the dogs surgery, she has done this before when I refused to pay. The other day two of her friends were texting me calling me a wanker and said they were going to tell people I abused my girlfriend. I am not worried about this because they texted me so I just kept the messages. But this did make me question a couple of things and what my gf said about me behind my back. Haven't broken up yet but feel it's inevitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally I am just wondering who is the asshole in this situation? I don't know if the dog could die but I don't think it will, still I don't feel it is my responsibility to take care of it. Even though it lived with me for a year and a half. ",

That day we had a duel (a schools wrestling team against ours) and my friend was gonna ask later that day after the duel. So I was talking to the girl with some of the other wrestlers while my buddy was playing basketball and it turns out that the other girl had told my friend to try sabotaging him and the girl wasn't interested in him. It didn't infuriate me because she didn't like him but that the other girl had the AUDACITY to do that to my friend.

I told the girl on my team that the girl had liked her. She was shocked And she told me she was straight but we went on with our duel (BTW I won both of my matches and she did as well and we both got 2 matches). Later that day we told my friend what we had done he was happy we got revenge for him. We decided to tell the girl for the satisfaction and to not be cruel to her and let her walk into her own humiliation. She responded calmly saying \"cool\" so we didn't think much of it later till... We heard her crying to her friends and me and friends smiled and looked at each other we felt satisfaction because we just repayed the favor. Later on during P.E. one of her friends came up to us and was telling us a shit ton of crap and all I really said was \"well we just Did she did to my friend so honesty you should get you're friend to apologize to him\" now here's where things get worse. Later on during break me and my friends are walking and I get pulled aside by maybe 20-30 girls and I see some of my wrestlers look at me and just mouth \"fuck\".

I sat beside him in a couple classes due to our second names and he was a really nice guy who was actually really funny.\n\nDuring lunch one day he was hanging out outside with a large group. They were messing about and another guy ended up falling on him and licking his face on accident (I have no clue how as I wasn't there). Anyway, from that the 'ship' was immediately born.

Everyday people (including me) would ask Jake about his 'relationship' and he would tell us to stop but in a joking way, so it continued. After a couple months the joke died off, but Jake had already become more reserved, but no one really noticed due to how quiet he already was. After a few weeks he stopped coming to school. His close friends were taken out of class a couple times but didn't tell us why. He deleted all his social media and just fell off the face of the earth. I heard from one of his friends that he developed social anxiety and doesn't like to leave his house anymore and is now homeschooled.\n\nHe had some underlining issues before this but I think this is what set him over the edge and I can't reach out to him because he deleted everything.

(We have chairs set out there for students who are waiting to see their professors.) They would talk and laugh raucously (often about work-inappropriate subjects, or trash-talking other employees), blast music and videos, and generally make it impossible for me to concentrate. My job requires a lot of time spent coding, and I am most productive in the morning, so this was a pretty significant disruption for me. I began closing my door when they arrived, but they took this as an invitation to close my office door \\*for me\\* before they sat down. They also started speaking to me only in whispers. I've tried to convince myself they were just being considerate in their own way, but honestly it pissed me off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this were their only break during the day maybe I'd get it, but they would also take their lunch in the same place outside my office for another hour+. Then my office is next to a lady who is close friends with one of them, so they would spend a lot of time hanging out next door too, in addition to their \"official\" breaks. Altogether it was about three hours a day I was having to deal with this (I started tracking it because I thought maybe it just felt longer). I should mention that most of us empty our own trash and vacuum our own offices, because we're lucky if the offices are vacuumed once a month, and the trash is left so long it starts to smell. Finally around Christmas, I was bombarded with emails from our department (i.e., the lady who is friends with one of the janitors) asking us to donate money to them as a holiday gift (there were eight emails total over the space two and half weeks). That was a bridge too far for me, and I finally complained about all of the above to HR, with the suggestion that they create a break room specifically for housekeeping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently their morning break is only supposed to be 15 minutes, so this was a big deal to the people in charge. Now the janitors refuse to make eye contact when when we pass each other, and passive-aggressively take their breaks a few steps down the hall where I can still hear them complaining about how awful and ungrateful I am (they don't use my name, but it's obviously me). The coworker next door told me that the chairs outside my office are the only warm place in the building for them to sit. And I'm starting to feel like a bad person because I know janitorial work is difficult and often thankless, and I seem like some uppity girl with a cushy desk job who has no idea what they do (I did work in housekeeping myself at one point, but they aren't aware).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "(Sorry if this is long, I just really need to get this off of my chest)\n\nSo, to give some context, I met this guy around 2014 in one of my favorite online games, and we've been close friends ever since. At first we've just had a normal \"get together and play together\" relationship, but somewhere around early 2015 he started coming to me to talk about his personal issues outside of the game.\n\nHe'd often talk about being abused by his family members, especially by his sister, how he often gets betrayed by his closest friends, how he only finds solace in eating, how tired he always feels, and other issues which I won't spend too much time dwelling into. Since he was a person I deeply cared about, so I tried giving him advice on what I think he should do, and I'd usually tell him that he should see a psychologist to get professional help, since there's only so much I (an internet friend) could do for him. He promised me he would do as I told him to do.\n\nThis went on for a long while. As I've said before, he started talking about these issues in 2015, and he would continue to come to me for advice until 2018, where this incident takes place.\n\nSo one day, I was just casually chatting with friends over Discord, and I suddenly noticed a notification for a group called \"My last goodbye\". I curiously opened it and I found my best friend had made a group to say goodbye to all his closest friends before he killed himself. Now, this initially shocked me. He's shown suicidal tendencies before, but he has never done something like this. I paused for a second, and then I started typing.  \nI asked him if he ever took or at least considered any of the advice I've given him over the 3 years he'd asked me for. He said that he hasn't, and the only reason he promised me he would was because he didn't want to upset me. This infuriated me, as I felt that all of the time and effort I spent caring for him were a waste. Our entire friendship felt like it was based on a web of lies. I just couldn't forgive him for what he's done. I told him to fuck off and I left the group chat. \n\nAnyway, from what I've heard from another friend, he didn't die in the end, apparently the amount of Advil he took wasn't enough for him to die of an overdose (How coincidental). I blocked him on Discord and deleted all forms of communication I had with him, and called it a day.\n\nThis happened less than a year ago, but it recently resurfaced in my mind, and I started feeling guilty. I started to wonder if I was wrong to do what I did that day, and I needed advice from an unbiased third party, AKA reddit. So guys, AITA?",

TL;DR at bottom.\n\nA few months ago I ended up getting involuntarily hospitalised for a suicide attempt. I got held for a week as the suspected cause was a bad reaction to medication. \n\nMy mother informed my boss (I couldn't contact my employer directly) and she was very understanding.\nI went back to work as soon as I was released. My employers continued to be nice and kept saying \"If you need anyhelo just ask\".\n\nI was doing my job very well by all accounts and worked on big holidays to make up for my absence. However it all seemed to suddenly go downhill when I took them up on their offer. \n\nThe workloads had increased for everyone, but strangely they'd gone up most for me and another colleague who's quite ill (a chronic illness). \nOne day I called and asked for assistance with the day's workload (I completed 95%). No one answered twice but I left a message. I ended up not being able to complete all my tasks after 9 hours and clocked out. The manager proceeded to scream at me and the next day my boss said \"getting help isn't part of your salary\" and that if I couldn't do the job I couldn't work there.\n\nAfter that I never failed to complete all tasks despite them steadily escalating but their treatment of me also declined, including being mocked for my physical appearance, the way I talk, what I eat and performing multiple checks on me per day to see if I failed anything despite me having the best customer feedback. \n\nNow I appear to have been soft fired, meaning they've changed my contract to an hourly contract and they're giving me about 50-70% less hours.\n\nSo AITA for taking so much time off then fucking up that day? \nAre they the assholes for their actions?\nBoth? Neither?\n\nTL;DR I tried to commit suicide, week long hospitalisation, employers initially understanding, devolved into workplace harassment and removing most work hours following a bad work day.\n\nNote: All this treatment was also aimed at my sick colleague but her employment is safe as she's been there for 15 years and has an ironclad contract. \n",

            "input": "Hey there! So this is my first post here, sorry if this is dumb or something, this is also kind of a half vent. I'm just feeling guilty right now and need the opinions of others who like...don't know me I guess.\n\nI'm a part of a program at my high school called Police Cadets. Basically it's a law enforcement program that was run by my advisor, who was subsequently my forensics teacher. We'd learn how to do police things and all that, such as how to deal with shoplifters, traffic stops, etc.\n\nWe were planning for regional competition about a couple of weeks ago. 8 of us were going, 5 of us for the CSI portion, and 3 of us for the Law Enforcement part. I was doing Law Enforcement, as well as two other people, a freshman we'll call A and a senior we'll call J. \n\nThree days ago, our advisor resigned from being a teacher due to personal issues. It was a detriment to all of us. Forensics would no longer have a good experienced teacher, and the fate of Police Cadets was super uncertain. We were all worried about what would happen to the club, and as a command officer (I'm a Sgt) I was in charge of trying to piece everything back together, as well as my captains, who will be G and L. \n\nCompetition was up in the air. Nobody could drive us, and the only teacher that could, can only fit 4 of us in her van. We had to split the group. We decided since CSI was our group scenario team, we'd pick three of them, and since Law Enforcement was an individual scenario, we would chose one person. \n\nSelf-transportation isn't an option since its a school event and the school would be liable for anything that happened. A was handed a permission slip as well as the group of freshmen (besides G. The freshman are M and S.)\n\nI was a bit nervous about the people chosen. The teacher who chose them was not a part of Police Cadets and basically only went off who was on the list (which half of the people on said list had been fired basically, the new people like me were supposed to replace them.) \n\nM, S, and A are all freshman. They are very new to the Cadet program and are not very well trained. M is not even technically a part of Police Cadets, and was only there so our advisor could fill spots because we thought we were all going. M and S were for the CSI team, as well as G, who was very adamant about not wanting to go with that group. M and S have been in the program for only about a week, S usually not even attending meetings either way.\n\nL's group was much more experienced, three years under each of their belts, and they are all incredibly hard workers. They processed two crime scenes within 2 hours for practice. We really wanted them to go and it was their last year at the school.\n\nA is probably the least worthy candidate to represent the Law Enforcement side of Police Cadets. J left the program (we would have chosen him, as he's a much higher rank than me) so he was not an option. A is one of my closer friends. She's in my Forensics class and is on my team in said class. She's rude, abrasive, loud mouthed, makes a lot of racist jokes, and is not very composed. She curses a lot in uniform and does not make very educated decisions 80% of the time. Not the demenor the competition requires an officer to have. She's young, a freshman, and a lower rank than me, being a private. \n\nShe will not leave our advisor alone either. Even since she left, she continuously emails her. We've asked her to leave her alone since she's going through a lot and she just refuses. She does not respect command staff, insulting us to our face and behind our backs. She believes she is better than us and more worthy of leadership despite how irresponsible and rude she is. She's not a leader, she is a tyrant.\n\nI've been there the same amount of time in, however I'm a junior, an officer, and have earned the trust of my advisor to be given a high rank so quickly. I work hard, and have a passion for law enforcement, since it's my dream career. I'm collected, have good command presence, and know how to make logical decisions even when under pressure. This is my last year as a school police cadet before I go and join the police department Cadets. \n\nAfter talking with my captains (higher ranks than me, so I wanted their advice) and all 3 of us agreed, even later getting agreement from L's group. The line up would be L's group for CSI and me to represent Law Enforcement. I was, however tasked with breaking the news to the freshmen. \n\nFirst, I talked to M and S. \n\nMe: Hey, so this isn't anything personal, but the command staff have decided we want the more experienced team to play for competition.\n\nS: *nods her head and gives a gentle, calm okay.*\n\nM: *suddenly raises her voice* No. I disagree. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, but since this is our last year we want to-\n\nM: That's not fair, I was specifically asked to be here for competition.\n\nMe: We didn't know we would have to pick and choose who was going. L's group has been waiting for competition and have been here longer than you.\n\nM: *unnecessarily dramatic* Fine then, fuck you, I don't need you then. I'm going home! *grabs her bag then pushes me away from her so she can leave. She stuck around anyways for some reason.*\n\nAt this point I was already on the verge of tears. On top of our advisor leaving, I had no clue what was going to happen to the program and was already stressed out. Being yelled at was not fun. I tried to stay professional though, and called A over.\n\nMe: Hey, so this entirely up to you since you're the one with the permission slip. I won't get mad if you say no, but...Could I go to competition instead?\n\nA: *silently staring at me*\n\nM: I'm a higher rank and have a bit more experience than you. This'll also be my last year and I wanted this to be what I leave on. \n\nA: I'm the only one doing what Ms. S wants us to do!\n\nMe: That's...not what I'm talking about. I'm just asking you a yes or no question, something you are more than welcome to deny. \n\nEveryone was sorta crowding around us now. \n\nG: We really don't think you're a good fit to represent us and you're also a bit...unproffesional? \n\nA: I'm doing what Ms. S told me to!\n\nG: Ms. S is not a part of this program now. You have to listen to me, L, and Dave (which is me by the way). We're the command staff. You also need to leave Ms. S alone, she's going through a lot and doesn't need any of us bothering her.\n\nA: Ms. S wants us to continue Police Cadets.\n\nMe: Nobody but you does.\n\nThe rest of us were either quitting or seniors who couldn't continue the program either way.\n\nMe: I'll ask you again. Can I go in your place?\n\nA: Do whatever. *she shoves the permission slip in my hand.* Nobody ever appreciates me! *stomps off and goes to grab her bag* I'm going home.\n\nMe: Okay, I think we should all go home as well, it's just about time to leave...\n\nA begins to scream at me when I enter the briefing room to grab my things. L stops us and intervenes. I just decide to go home.\n\nI still kinda feel like an asshole for doing that... I really wanted to go, and I feel selfish, but on the other hand, nobody else wanted either of the three to go? I want a freshman to experience a competition, but I just didn't think any of the freshmen would be good representatives of our program.\n\nSorry this was so all over the place, the story just kinda needed a lot of context. Thank you.\n\n\n\n",

It's quite short, I just wanted to see if people would think this would be justified if I did something in future if I ever see this girl again.\n\nFor context this happened in our sixth form working area - a pretty small space, just for the sixth formers to use. (I'm not sure what this would translate to for other countries, I think final year of highschool? Ages 16 - 18.) Not quite a library, no more than maybe 20 computers and a couple desks, arranged in what I guess you would call a U shape, with a big whiteboard at one end.

It can get quite busy up there and most of the time all of the computers are taken because of the amount of students.\n\nI got up there early today so I could work on some english coursework, at 8:30, twenty minutes before lessons start. I didn't have any lessons for quite some time today so I figured I'd work on the coursework for a couple hours before then. \n\nI haven't been up there long until another student, probably from the year below me, year 12, puts her laptop on the desk next to me and starts fiddling with the wires underneath the desk. She unplugs the school computer from the main socket and starts using it to charge her laptop instead. She just leaves it there and walks off, probably to go to her lesson. I never saw her come back and I was there for a solid two hours, although the laptop was gone after I came back from quick break. \n\nIt was a pretty expensive looking laptop, rose gold in colour, so I was pretty shocked that she just walked off, but I was also annoyed that she unplugged a school computer that someone else might need to use just to charge her laptop, which she could have done at home or some other time.\n\nI ignored it, I'm not really a confrontational person, but I felt like unplugging it and moving it elsewhere. My friend suggested opening it up and trying to lock her out of her own laptop by messing around with the password but I felt that was a bit over the top.

She kind of waves at me like I didn't see her, but she moves out of the way.\n\nAs I open my door to get out, she comes to my door yelling at me that I'm rude. Because she's already yelling, I yell back that she's the rude one because she was standing in a spot meant for cars in a busy area.\n\nThen, the person she was saving the spot for came around in their car and was blocking traffic (there were two lanes, one going in each direction) because she was yelling at me instead of getting in the car. She told me that I almost hit her with my car. I feel like (and I didn't say this out loud) I didn't hit her because she moved out of the way.

Before she gets in the car, she calls me a gorilla. The only thing I have called her during the yelling is rude. And also that she's not a car so she can't park in a spot.\n\nMy husband and I go on our way, then after getting what we were in the area for we head back to our car. I pass the lady again on the sidewalk with her companion (maybe her dad?). I want to ignore her but she sees me and says, \"Oh, god.\" Then stands there yelling at me again that I'm rude and she's going to call the police because I almost hit her. The person she's with called me a bitch. I was very careful not to swear because I'm not sure if that counts as verbal assault or what. He yells at me sarcastically, \"Your parents must be so proud of you!\" And I was like, \"Actually, my mom is!\" He also said something to along the lines of, \"She's proud of you for swearing and calling people names?\" I say, \"I never swore! And this woman called me a gorilla!\" \n\nThe man accuses my husband of calling him an asshole. Which I didn't hear but my husband admits it, and my husband also told them to \"get the fuck out of here\" because the man had called me a name, which I also didn't hear amid all the yelling.

And parking spots are for cars? Also, I didn't hit her?\n\nAITA for not driving on and just giving her the parking spot? Is that by default an A-hole move? Because she was so angry it makes me question it. Is there an unspoken code for drivers that if someone is standing in a parking spot, just move on? I argued back because she yelled first. I've been conflicted about this since it happened. When I saw he was older, I felt kinda bad. I just want to add that I feel like if she had said to me civilly, instead of coming at me yelling, \"My dad is an older dude, is it okay if we take this spot\" I would have moved. \n\nI did look up afterwards to see if it's legal in my town for people to hold parking spots.

            "input": "Some context, my (28m) fiance (27f) has had health issues which left her in a lot of pain and unable to move around much at all for the majority of 2018. I had picked up the slack and would do the dishes, laundry, taking out the garbage and other miscellaneous tasks. It took a toll on me and we would have constant fights back then to which I admit I may have been at fault back then. Regardless though she always exclaimed that after getting better the first few things she wanted to start doing again was helping with the chores.\n\nThe thing is now that she's had surgery and fully recovered here I was expecting things to shift back to normal where it would be a little more evenly split between us yet here I am still doing all of these things 90% (laundry100% of the time)of the time, my main issue being the laundry. We live in an apartment and need to walk up two flights of stairs to reach the laundry room. When I slack off because I'm tired after work it can really pile up. \n\nThings really started to build up and get to me,  we have been fighting quite consistently the previous weeks. I had been asking her to please not wait for the garbage bin to be so full you can't close it before taking it out( small apartment with open garbage bins don't work). Well that continued and then the same day she actually decided to do the laundry but ended forgetting it downstairs and blamed me for not reminding her, I had apparently agreed to keep track but I did not hear this request as I had my head phones at that time. So this turns into a larger argument.\n\nI feel she doesn't follow through with what she says all the time and I feel lied to. Her argument though is that she appreciates what I do for her but she forgets and these things shouldn't be an issue. I've been trying really hard to see things from her point of view but it just never feels like she understands why I get upset. \n\nTL;DR : Fiance promised to help out with chores after recovering but that fell through and I still end up doing it.

            "input": "I was on the phone with my best friend as I was bringing in my garbage bins from the curb. Two bins, one for garbage, and one for recycle. These are the big, plastic 40-gallon bins that make it easy for the garbage crew to dump the contents into the open top of the truck.\n\nI put the recycle bin back into my yard, and went back to go bring the garbage bin. When I pulled it back towards the curb, it hadn\u2019t yet been emptied.\n\nSome background: I leave my bins out next to my other neighbors\u2019 bins, sort of small convenience for the garbage crew- they only have to make the one stop for 4 of the houses that comprise the cul-de-sac.\nRather than leave my bin there and come back later, I checked my neighbor\u2019s bin, and saw that he had practically nothing in it. I transferred my own 4 full garbage bags into his bin, and started to haul mine back to my yard.\n\nI narrated this to my friend as I was doing it.\n\nHe told me to stop, and told me that I was being an asshole for doing that. He said it would be better if I just go back and get the bin after it is emptied, like everyone else.\n\nA bit more background: I live in a HOA neighborhood, where part of the dues we pay goes towards garbage removal. Other than the HOA dues, or if you want large pick-up on day that isn\u2019t already designated for large pick up (they do this twice per year), we do not pay for garbage removal. Even if we did, my neighbor\u2019s one big bin wasn\u2019t even 1 quarter of the way full, as we have weekly pickup, and my bags filled his to about 3 quarters full.\n\nI relayed this information to my friend, and he still said, \u201cCall it what you want, but you\u2019re still an asshole.\u201d\n\nMy issue is that my friend was so adamant that I was an asshole, and in fact ended the call very abruptly as soon as I refused to do what he must have felt was the right thing. I later talked to my wife about it, and she said she didn\u2019t see it. Thinking back on it, we came up with the idea that, had the garbage not been picked up that day, my neighbor would be inconvenienced the extra trash in his bin that I put there. It was a moot point, however, since the garbage bins were picked up later. I saw the truck pass on my doorbell video when the motion alert came up (big trucks always trigger the motion alert).\n\nI intend to call my friend back and chat it out with him, but this is pretty late for him, and it\u2019s on my mind, so I figured I would ask and get some perspective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL; DR: My friend thinks I am an asshole for putting my garbage in my neighbor\u2019s nearly-empty bin so that I didn\u2019t have to go back and get the bin after it was collected later on that day.\n\nWhat do you think, AITA\u2019ers? Am I an asshole for putting my garbage bags in my neighbors garbage bin?",

            "input": "On mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues. Also using a throwaway.\n\nSo back in college, I met this guy (M) in one of my classes. He wasn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed and struggled with a lot of the assignments.\n\nNow, I would regularly help out a few struggling classmates with their assignments. One day, M found our study group and asked for help on the particular assignment we were currently working on in our group.\n\nI told him that I would be happy to help, but M didn\u2019t have the assignment on him at the time, so he asked if he could email me the assignment and if I could help him later that night since the assignment was due the next day. I said that was fine, but I had work later so he would have to wait until later that night. \n\nI got home from work and found an email from M in my inbox. He sent me what he had so far and it was clear that he put in little to no effort. Everything was either completely wrong or incomplete. I took roughly an hour to reply to him with a very thoughtful, well-written, constructive email with feedback on what he can do to improve his work. He later replied and instead of saying \u201cThanks for your help\u201d or asking a follow up question, I got the letter \u201cK\u201d. A \u201cK\u201d in return for the time I took out of my evening to analyze his shitty work and explain to him what the professor had already explained in class. I was pissed, and I didn\u2019t help him after that.\n\nA few weeks later after the class I had with M ended, I was working on an assignment in one of the common areas on campus and M found me. He came and sat down next to me and started bragging about how he had made $400 working 40 hours at his internship. I wasn\u2019t having it, so I made up some excuse, got up and left.\n\nI didn\u2019t see him much after that, but I heard from a lot of friends that he would regularly manipulate people to do his assignments for him and brag about how much money he was making to everyone and anyone.  \n\nFast forward to present day, all of my friends graduated college and we are all working jobs that we enjoy. One day out of the blue, I got an invitation from M to connect on LinkedIn. At first, I was just going to decline it, but my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to see what he was up to, so I accepted. I saw his profile and it didn\u2019t appear that he was able to hold onto any job for longer than a few months, which wasn\u2019t surprising since the guy would just have other people do his assignments for him. I told my friends who knew him and we all had a good laugh about it since it seemed like this manipulator got what he deserved. \n\nA few days later, he messaged me on LinkedIn asking me if I was enjoying my current job. I just ignored it and went on living life.\n\nA few weeks after that, he messaged me again asking the same question. Again, I ignored it and moved on.\n\nThen a few days ago, he messaged me once more asking if I ever consider employment opportunities outside and in addition to my current job. For the hell of it, I replied saying that I do and I asked him what he had in mind. The TL;DR of the conversation we had over a week is that he was working with a wealthy couple who set him up with the opportunity to help other individuals start their own business selling products and services. He bragged about how this opportunity was going to allow him to retire in two years and by joining this MLM (pyramid scheme) I could potentially retire early as well. The whole time he was really defensive about all of the details (he wouldn\u2019t tell me specifically who he was working with, what products he was selling, etc.) \n\nTurns out, he was messaging my friends as well about he same \u201copportunity\u201d. We all began replying to him and asking for more details just to waste his time. The way we see it, the more time he spends talking with us, the less time he has to actually manipulate someone who is unsuspecting. \n\nIn his last message, he was asking if we could meet up for a \u201cpre-interview\u201d and I was going to finally just block him and move on with my life. However, I was telling one of the interns at work (who goes to the same school M and I went to) about this and he told me that M regularly makes trips out to campus to prey on unsuspecting students and try to get them to join his pyramid scheme. His latest victim has apparently been a special needs student and this just made me hate M more.\n\nI am thinking about scheduling a meeting with him out in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere just to waste more of his time and then just no-show and block him once and for all.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for wasting his time and WIBTA if I schedule the pre-interview?\n",

To go back home, it would take at least 2 flights and 28 hours one way, so I never get to visit (can never attend family gatherings, weddings, funerals, etc), since my work schedule is pretty hectic, and I rarely get to take actual vacations. If you're anything familiar with latin american families, you must know this is a pretty big deal for me, and I miss my family and friends (and everything else) like crazy, even though my life here right now is pretty amazing.  \n  \nAnyway, the longest national holiday in this country is coming up, and this year, it will be a 10-day thing. This is a rare opportunity for me to actually be able to spend a few days in my home country, so I started making plans to travel with my boyfriend a while ago (he is Japanese, and works even more than I do). Due to multiple factors (job change, move, other setbacks), we couldn't get to purchase tickets months in advance, and since this is the only decent holiday in this country, the prices quickly sky-rocketed, and we couldn't afford it. So we had basically given up on going anywhere, and were thinking of things to do during that period that wouldn't break the bank.  \nUnrelated to this issue, things haven't been going too well for us as a couple. We have been fighting a lot, there is quite a lack of affection recently, and while it's embarassing to admit, I'm resenting him a lot lately. I have been thinking of breaking up, but we somehow always make up after a fight, and we still like each other (have talked about marriage, etc). So I'm torn about that as well.  \nRecently, my father has contacted me offering to pay for my trip back home, because he knows I have been kind of down lately, and honestly, because he misses me. I got super excited, and there is nothing I'd like more than going back for the first time in years, but that would mean leaving my boyfriend behind, when we were both looking for things to do together during the holiday.  \nConsidering things haven't been great for us recently, and how much I need some time away, I'm pretty much set on taking my dad's offer. That would make my boyfriend pretty upset though. So, Would I Be The Asshole if I went back home and left him with nothing to do?  \n  \nTL;DR: Boyfriend and I had plans to visit my home country for the first time in years during the holidays. Realized we couldn't afford it, and gave up. Things haven't been going too well with said boyfriend, because of unrelated reasons. My dad has offered to pay for me to go, because he wants to see me. I want to go, but boyfriend would be upset. WITBA if I went?",

I tested multiple times over a long period and I developed a severe anxiety disorder. \n\nAfter we made out, things were going to sex. I stopped her and mentioned about my situation and I'm afraid of having sexual intercourses with someone I met recently.

I sent her and then she asked me about what she will say to get tested etc. Then suddenly she said \"You know what, let's not do this and break up at the first place\" I completely freaked out when I saw this. As I told you, my anxiety makes me feel worried even in a simple situation. I start to face panic attacks whenever I face a situation like this. I asked her and insisted to learn why she gave up and eventually she admitted that she has HPV. \n\nI wasn't mad at her but I freaked out.

I cant fathom staying with someone who actually does.\n\nBut thats what my housemate is like, she gets attached and even when she knows its wrong cant detach.\n\nI only met them two days after they broke up when i moved in, so i never met my housemate when she was happy and settled. So far shes been grumpy and moody and drinking a lot, but shes also terrified of change and trust me when i say shes been through a lot of those in the last couple weeks.\n\nSo theyre broken up... And the ex is constantly around. Under the guise of finding the dog (puppy they got together was stolen) but shes here way too often and with her daughter even so i call bullshit.\n\nANYWAY they were arguing the other night, ex was yelling at housemate to help her look for the dog, housemate was saying no because she doesnt want to get in the car with the exs brother. Ex wasnt listening and eventually i (i was in the lounge 2 metres from the argument) spoke up and told ex that housemate said no so leave it.\n\nIt didnt help at all, just got told to butt out by the ex, but didnt escelate anything either. I later apologised to housemate for overstepping my bounds but she said it was fine and my other housemate thanked me because shes always been too scared to say anything. (Ex is one of those chicks who LOOKS like you dont want to be on her bad side. And ive seen evidence that she lives up to her appearance)\n\nAs much as im told i was fine and perfectly in the right to speak up, i still cant help but feel i had no right as it wasnt my battle to pick and im not sure its even any of my business, happening in my house or not.\n\n(Further info, im on a months trial so i dont even officially live here yet)\n\nAITA for stepping in on my housemates argument with her ex?",

This is normally quite difficult because my father and I work at the same place but on completely opposite shifts (I work nights on days that he has off and he works days on nights that I have off). But I agreed believing that my father would either take a day off or I'd receive a text asking what days I could meet for dinner after my father got out of work. But I didn't hear anything until recently when my mother brought up that we still hadn't done anything so I offered doing a dual celebration for both mine and my sister's birthdays since her's is in a week anyways. I'm also a member of a juggling club (have been for years, they were actually the first friends I made when I got into college) but because I work a rotating shift I only get to go to the club once or twice a month instead of weekly; I've been juggling with this group for over 6 years and have gone to juggling conventions with them and they have all remained very good friends of mine and my family knows all this.\n\nTonight my mother texted me again asking when I would like to get together for dinner so I told her we should just do the dual celebration for both mine and my sister's birthdays since we're already close to hers and that it would have to be \"on a day that Dad works after he gets out of work because I haven't earned any vacation time yet.\" She then made a group text for her, my father, my sister and me and asked if everyone would be good for having dinner on my sister's 21st birthday (which would be on the same day at the same time that the juggling club meets). I responded asking if we could have dinner the day after my sister's birthday because I haven't gone to the juggling club in over a month and I would really like to practice and see my friends again. My sister told me off for wanting to juggle instead of spend her birthday with her (she goes to the same college I did and it would be very easy for me to visit her before or after the juggling club meeting). I told her I would skip juggling club for her birthday but that I would much rather just celebrate her birthday a day late because I haven't been juggling in over a month. \n\nMy sister got mad at me for wanting to push her birthday celebration off one day so I could practice juggling and see friends and accusing me of not wanting to celebrate my own birthday (even though no one texted me about it until after my bday had already passed) and not wanting to see my family anymore. I tried explaining that I don't get to go to the club very often and I would like to take the opportunity when it arises because I haven't juggled in a group since before Christmas (which I spent with family), but she accused me of caring more about juggling than I do about family and saying \"I only turn 21 once.\" The conversation ended with her calling me a dick  and saying that she didn't want me at her birthday anyways. \n\nI plan on asking my parents if we can celebrate in a restaurant near my college because that would allow me to go to the beginning of the juggling club meeting and celebrate my sisters birthday, but I can't help but feel guilty because I am kinda choosing friends and personal hobbies over family but only because I haven't done this in quite a while and really want to see my friends and practice with them all again.\n\nTL;DR: My family didn't text me about celebrating my birthday until after it had already passed but when I suggested celebrating my sister's birthday the day after her actual birthday so I could visit friends (who I haven't seen in over a month) and practice a hobby I really enjoy with them. Am I the asshole for asking the celebration be moved back a day even though no one asked me if the date was ok even though none of them asked me about celebrating my birthday until it had already passed?",

I'm a 19 year old freshman in college who lives away from my parents, but they still help me greatly and help me take out loans and pay for part of my tuition and I couldn't be more thankful for that, really. I would have to drastically alter my lifestyle and be under a lot more stress without their help.\n\nHowever, my parents are pretty religious and conservative (I am definitely not) and they do not want me doing any illegal drugs or having sex before marriage. I am very sexually active, and also love smoking weed and dropping acid. I never do it in my dorm, but at my friend's places. I know that my parents explicitly tell me not to do these things and although they haven't said it exactly, I know if they found out that I did, that they would stop supporting me financially.\n\nI am doing great in school, so it's not like their help is being wasted or taken for granted. I just feel guilty because I am lying by omission here because I know they would disown me or dissociate from me if they found out what my lifestyle was like outside of school. On the flip side, I feel like since it's my body, it should be my choice what I do with it, and my business, and that I shouldn't feel obliged to tell them what I am doing with my own body. I don't do drugs in a manner that puts them at risk for legal reasons- I live far from them- so I'm only putting myself at risk here. Am I the asshole for continuing to get financial aid from my parents while having sex and doing drugs in my free time? I am not willing to give up this lifestyle as it doesn't adversely affect me, and instead makes me happier and have more fun on my downtime. My options would be to continue to do this and lie by omission, or tell my parents what I'm doing and suffer them being very heart broken and also not financially supporting me anymore. (They won't stop paying for my college unless I give them a reason to because they are nice and if I just asked them to stop paying for some reason they would probably be weirded out and think I was trying to get away from them) \n\nThank you for your replies!",

They\u2019re good friends and we like to joke around a lot but recently they\u2019re behaviors have been getting more and more on my nerves. \n\nLet\u2019s start with R. R has no respect for my personal boundaries and constantly touches me in places which are triggers for me. For the past year I\u2019ve continually asked him to stop touching me but he never listens. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019m trans (ftm) and he\u2019s threatened me by saying he\u2019ll call me by my deadname if I didn\u2019t do something for him. This is a big trigger for my dysphoria and he knows this. When I call him out he paints himself like the victim and says I took whatever he did the wrong way, wether it be him belittling my mental health and making it seem like not a big deal or touching me when I tell him not to, and he rarely apologizes. How hard is it to just apologize and move on, seriously? He does tale it to the extreme sometimes and even went as far as to one time tell me that he should just \u201cstop talking\u201d and I told him how ridiculous he was acting but he didn\u2019t listen. \n\nD is childish and annoying. It\u2019s like he still stuck in elementary school (we\u2019re in high school) and he acts very immature. I\u2019ve only ever told him once to \u201cgrow up\u201d bluntly but that was only because he was getting on my nerves. When I do hint that I want him to act maturely he takes it to the extreme and acts like a stereotypical asshole. He also has a habit of running in really stunted steps (basically he barley brings his foot up and drags it along the ground as he runs) and it really annoys me. \n\nI have another friend who\u2019s just a whole other story.

For our situation it\u2019s a little bit harder because we can only do sexy stuff on the weekend. \n\nAfter that conversation, despite my attempts to be more \u201cspontaneous,\u201d the amount of sexual activity that we have has been on a steady decline. Whenever I try and be spontaneous like she wanted and initiate something when we are watching a show or getting ready for bed (which is what she told me to do originally when we first discussed it) she has shut me down about 95% of the time. Which has been discouraging, but I understand because she\u2019s a human being and deserves the right to say no.  The only issue I\u2019ve had is that I find this to be hypocritical of what she originally wanted and that the excuses are generally crappy, examples: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get dirty\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m just not feeling it\u201d, etc. which only bothers me because she recycles the same few excuses every week.\n\nNow listen, I\u2019m an 18 year old guy, I have sexual needs and I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m a horny SOB half the time, but either way this decline in sexual activity started to get to me after a month or two of these failed attempts.\n\nThe main thing that got to me was that half the time she would hype up all the sex we would have in the upcoming weekend, and then we wouldn\u2019t even kiss at all or do anything remotely sexual, which added to the build up of sexual frustration.\n\nFast forward to our anniversary. We went on a three hour road trip to a beach, nice romantic place and the entire month before my girlfriend was hyping up all the acts we were going to do. Long story short, we had sex once over the two nights we stayed and not at all on our anniversary night. When she hit me with the \u201cI just want to go to bed,\u201d I let out a short sigh and turned off my lamp. She then proceeded to chew me out and say \u201cI hope you know if you did that to any other girl then they\u2019d hate you.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line which I told her is that I\u2019m a human being and I can\u2019t control my initial reaction, but that after the fact I completely understand and want what\u2019s best for her. \n\nI tried to explain my point of view and covered everything in this post, as well as we\u2019ve talked about this issue before, she just doesn\u2019t get my point of view I guess.\n\nAnyways, am I the asshole?\n\nI\u2019d like input from both guys and girls so I can see a variety of opinions, also I know this isn\u2019t r/relationship_advice but if any of you guys have anything advice-wise I\u2019d appreciate it.\n",

            "input": "Hey there,\n\nso, just a couple of hours ago I got into a little argument with a fellow student about a workdesk in our university's library. It's a common place to study for a lot of students as it's very quiet and most of the literature that we need is concentrated there. There's six \"seats\" or workdesks per large table, and there's about 40 large tables in the library, so if there's no exams immediately ahead, there's always a lot more free seats than occupied seats.\n\nAnyways, my girlfriend and I like to sit opposite from each other at the window side of the table (the tables are 3x2 seats: 2 seats at the window, 2 middle seats, 2 aisle seats). Normally, we enter together when the library opens at 8 am, sit down and study. This morning, however, my girlfriend needed to get to an early appointment, so I went alone, sat down at the window desk, and put some books on the desk opposite from mine, to \"reserve\" her workdesk. I put that in quoation marks, because apart from those two desks, there's virtually no other that is occupied. I just wanted to prevent someone to randomly pick that desk over any other random desk.\n\nSo then, at maybe 8.30 am, this guy comes to my table, sits down at the desk opposite from me, and puts the books at the desk next to him. Mind you, apart from those two desks, I can see literally no other occupied. The guy has not only 4 other desks to sit down, but also 12 at the tables next to ours (including 4 other window seats).\n\nSo I say: Excuse me, I put the books there for my girlfriend, who's coming any minute now.\n\nHe replies: So? I want to sit at the windows and you can't reserve seats for people.\n\nMe: I realize that, but would it be so bad if you just chose one of the other window seats?\n\nHe: Yes.\n\nMe: Well, ok.\n\nYes, you actually shouldn't save seats for people, but this is something a lot of people do at our library when there's plenty of space and no one gets denied a desk and it's something no one normally has a problem with. I got the feeling that for him it wasn't so much about where he sits, but about him wanting to show me I couldn't reserve seats, no matter how many other seats were available (really, I felt a bit like the guy in this pic [https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1031966-urinal-etiquette](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1031966-urinal-etiquette)). It's also that everytime I see a \"reserved\" seat like this, I just pick another one and don't think about it further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, who's right here?",

The group is formed mainly on post-highschoolers and undergraduate people who have been doing music almost their entire life, but don't want to quit doing it after pursuing a  different career like engineering, lawschool, medicine, etc. We sing from academic music to the popular type. There are plenty more girls than guys. \n\n3 months ago all the male members of the group have had trouble going to rehearsals, myself  included. The reason ? We are all at different points in our careers, some starting university, some finishing up, some already working, and that sometimes can get on the way of singing. Noticing this, the conductor decides she is going to do the end of the year program with just the girls and build a program made to work with female voices. A cool way of handling the temporal absence of the guys. While picking the songs, the conductor asks my girlfriend if she could have a couple of Christmas songs arranged to work on the female choir, since she's been doing some self-taught composition, so they'd add them to the program. She agrees and delivers. They prepare during the three months for the concert. During this time she also finished and got her engineering degree.\n\nNow, I'm finishing my degree on Computer Science and me and my friend are working on our dissertation/thesis, this is the last phase and we have to finish the project and deliver the paper this week. However, our project is quite big for an undergraduate project. When we started, our advisor, and also other advisors, told us it was a task closer to graduates. We dived right into the madness and went with it. Took also a part time internship at a software company.  Long story short, a year passed by and this is the due week.\n\nThe date for the recital, was last Sunday, late afternoon. She was really excited I was there to see her and the songs she arranged. I told her I would be there. A month ago I asked for a month permit at work so I could work full time on my thesis since there was no way I could finish working with them at the same time, they willingly granted it. Me and my friend are going every single day all day to the campus, Sunday to Sunday, for a month to work on it. Still managed to make time to see my girlfriend every Friday and Saturdays. We, myself and my friend, were at the university on last Sunday morning finishing the last details before collecting results, but something came up which could prevent us from finishing within the date limits, and my permit ended so I couldn't work on it the next day. I called my girlfriend and told her I may not be able to be at the recital since we had this problem, and needed to fix it, but will try to be there hoping she would understand. Stayed till late night at the university but we were able to fix the issue.\n\nShe was disappointed, and said she told me with time when the recital was. She's upset I wasn't there despite I explained why and now she thinks that her things are not important to me and that she always makes time for the things that matter but I couldn't make time to go to the recital.\n\nAm I the asshole ?\n\nTL,DR: girlfriend had recital on Sunday where she arranged the songs. My dissertation due date is the week after the recital, problem came up on Sunday and had to stay late night fixing it or else I might not be able to finish it and missed the concert. Girlfriend is now upset despite me calling her to inform her the problem came up and might not be able to go.",

I don\u2019t owe my dog love and affection. But I give it to them anyway, because it makes them happy, it makes me happy, and *it\u2019s the right thing to do.*\n\nSo having said that, if my ex from a fairly amicable split decided to message me six months later with a genuine, sincere apology for things he thinks he did wrong, and he made it clear he wasn\u2019t expecting anything from it, I would at least give him the courtesy of telling him how I felt about what he wrote. Because *it\u2019s the right thing to do.*\n\nYou know what I wouldn\u2019t do? I wouldn\u2019t ignore them and block them.\n\nI sent a sincere apology to my ex the other, and he blocked me. I didn\u2019t expect anything to come of it, but I at least expected some kind of honest response out of it. I thought he was better than ignoring and blocking. He fucking told me he wanted to be friends *multiple times.* I guess that was a lie he told *multiple times.*\n\nHe\u2019s allowed to feel how he feels, I\u2019m not angry over that. But he does NOT get to act like I was the only who pulled shit worth leaving over. Yes I had anxiety attacks, yes I was emotionally a lot to handle at times. But at least I worked on my shit. I sought therapy. I got on medication. I started journaling and meditating and doing things that were good for me because I deserved to be healthy and happy.\n\nHim? He made me feel like shit for having anxiety in the first place. He made me feel like all of our problems were because of me. He never put any effort into the relationship. He ignored my needs. He NEVER ONCE made good on his promises. He promised to help me in making sure my medication wasn\u2019t causing any weird side effects. When it did, he said nothing. He promised to be more present. He didn\u2019t. He promised to fucking *read* some articles I sent him that I thought could help our relationship. He didn\u2019t. And he promised that he would tell me if he ever found himself in a place where he didn\u2019t think he could he in my life in any capacity. He didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd he knew...he FUCKING KNEW that the one thing I hate more than anything else in a person is being ghosted like that. HE KNEW THAT ABOUT ME, AND HE DID IT ANYWAY. Yes, I pulled some shit that nobody would blame him for walking away from, but SO DID HE. He\u2019s not the only victim here.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what really fucking gets me. Over the three years we knew each other, I can honestly say that I\u2019m a better person now than I was back then. Much better. I cannot say the same for him. If anything, he got worse.\n\nThat said, am I the asshole here? Am I a bad person not worth dating? Anytime I talk about how I feel on reddit, they blame me. Anytime I talk about how I feel to a therapist, they tell me it\u2019s not my fault. And I don\u2019t know why.\n\nSo who\u2019s correct? Reddit? Or my therapist? Am I actually the asshole?\n",

The summer before junior year, Richard, a mutual friend, was inducted into the group. He went to the other of two high schools in the district, but I didn't know him as well as others did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard was a fine addition at first. He was fun to be around the first couple of times. After a while, he started to annoy me. But other people were enjoying his presence so I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it. Richard quickly became \"one of the boys\" and I gradually became more and more annoyed by him. I found out towards the end of the summer that Richard was transferring to my high school. ~~Of course, I was thrilled.~~ I decided since my issues with Richard were mostly a personality clash, I would give him a shot, considering I'd see him on a near daily basis. That chance didn't last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard has done the following:\n\n* He sent in a group chat a photo of a halved cat, guts spilling out. We told him that wasn't cool. He sent the photo three more times.\n* He screamed \"n\\*\\*\\*\\*\" out the window of his car while speeding down residential roads at \\~60mph. Richard is white.\n* He's been creepy-flirty with female friends, despite having a girlfriend.\n   * This relationship won't last much longer. He detailed how he's gonna break her heart pretty soon. She's nice doesn't deserve it.\n* He constantly talks about how privileged he is in the douchiest way possible, and regularly describes himself as an alpha male.\n* While ill on a school trip, he shit in a hotel bed, but hid his pants behind a dresser, and left the mess for housekeeping to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost my last straw a few Fridays ago when five friends (Richard included) and I went to a burger joint to eat. Richard was high out of his mind when we sat down. This is not uncommon for him. He probably drove there high too. He regularly called over our server, often when they were already helping someone else, for the most insignificant reasons. He ordered his food before the rest of us were ready because he couldn't wait 5 minutes. When he got his food, he deemed his bun to be insufficient for his burger and demanded a larger bun, even after we insisted to him that those were the only buns available. He audibly made fun of other customers, and took a picture of a man he thought looked like Walter White with his shutter sound on. I asked for the check as soon as possible because I wanted out of that situation. I don't think Richard tipped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WIBTA for campaigning fiercely to outcast Richard from our social circle?** I'm not the only person who has issues with him, but everyone else is afraid of confrontation. I'm afraid this will cause weird tensions among mutual friends who have known him longer than I have.",

            "input": "So me and my roommate have been pretty good friends but as happens in these situations there have been some difficulties but for the first year things have actually gone pretty well until recently. I'll call my roommate Arthur and his girlfriend Mary.\n\n\nOne other thing I should mention is we live in a house that I'm in the upstairs and hes downstairs, this was his decision as the downstairs has a bit more storage and higher ceilings to fit his television.\n\n\nRecently he started dating Mary who i feel has been trying to slowly push her way in. I would actually be okay with her moving in, with the condition that this would mean I could move out and she would take over the rent, which may be a bit expensive for Mary but that's not really any of my business.\n\n\n I also have a GF I have been dating the entire time we have lived together. She stays over one weekend night a week and visits for about 2 hours from 6 to 8 most weeknights. Since Arthur has started dating Mary she is typically over when I get home from work until my roommate leaves for work in the morning.\n\n\nOn one occasion when she was staying over for the third night consecutively, I texted my roommate that if she was going to move in I would start looking for a new place. He did apologize, said she was over too often and that there had been special circumstances in this case. This would not be a normal thing was what I was assured. For about 2 weeks this was true, Mary only stayed over once or twice and when she was over there was definatemt a reduction in volume so I thought things were on the right track. \n\n\nThis pattern of her staying over consistently has begun again though with her being over 4 of the last 5 nights to sleep. \n\n\nThere are two living room areas outside of the bedrooms. His is downstairs. My television is in the upstairs living room which has no separation between it and the kitchen. \n\n\nWith just Arthur this was never an issue as he generally kept to his own stuff, wouldnt be making excessive noise and usually completed whatever he was doing in an hour at most. \n\n\nMary however loves to bake, and does have a kitchen available at the place that she rents. Usually I'd just go to my room and watch some videos on my phone but I had a hockey game on in the evening that I had no way to record, when I came home I didn't even have the time to finish serving the pizza I'd picked up for my GF and myself on the way home for work before they were climbing over me to get to the stove. They had also been home for at least an hour and a half before this. \n\n\nArthur notices that I give Mary a look when I have to carry my pizza around her to the plates I had just set on the counter, that she decided to stand between myself and the box. Arthur asks if I have a problem with them being upstairs and I awnser that I dont mind having him upstairs, but that his girlfriend doesn't need to be baking him cookies here, she could do that at her house and bring them here. She stormed off downstairs and my roommate proceeded to be upstairs until midnight making his cookies (from 6:30 PM). \n\n\nI just dont feel comfortable.coming home from work and having them in my space. It also bothers me how long their sessions upstairs seem to be. Generally when they bake it takes between 6-8 hours until I can be sure that a stranger isn't going to be in my living area. I probably would not have said anything if not asked but now I feel like I need to set some boundaries and I'm wondering if people would think these rules are too strong. \n\nThese rules would also apply to my girlfriend as well as his. \n1. 2 Overnights per 7 days (I was thinking 3 but I feel like any leeway I give them they will take advantage of)\n2. Guests should ask permission before parking in driveway. (Takes my spot every night I come home and makes a big stink when I get her to move). \n3. 24 Hour notice if guests are going to be in the other person's living space\n4. Guests may not use kitchen or laundry appliances\n5. Guests should only arrive when invited ( Mary likes to show up and bang on the door at night to wake her boyfriend up to let her in, it doesn't bug me as I usually stay up later but its knocked some of my valuables off shelves). If they arrive unannounced they should contact the resident by phone instead of body checking the house\n6. Guests should clean up any messes they leave in the house. ( I dont mind if my roommate leaves stuff in the sink for a day or two, I'll usually even clean it as that's usually easy as putting it into the dishwasher after emptying, but I'm not cleaning up after her baking and he doesn't either)\n\nAre these fair rules or AITA?

We have disagreements and fights but nothing we couldn\u2019t talk through over Chinese food until yesterday. We both have hobbies we share as well as hobbies we don\u2019t share, one of which for me is video games. \n\nI\u2019m 25 and I\u2019ve been playing video games since the original Pok\u00e9mon games back in the 90s.  Yesterday I went to GameStop with a friend and my younger brother to pre-order the new Pok\u00e9mon games (Call me a man child if you wish I\u2019ll always love Pok\u00e9mon lol) She gets home from work about the time I got home too and sees the receipt on my desk because I didn\u2019t get a chance to file it in my cabinet yet. \n\nAll of a sudden she\u2019s giving me an ultimatum: video games or her. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she thinks I care more about video games than her (this has never been a topic of discussion before this). \n\nI told her if it came to it I would choose the video games over her not because they are more important but because she resorted to an ultimatum for something is consider silly and if she is going to do that what is she capable of demanding in a marriage setting? Our shifts overlap so 90% of my playing is while she\u2019s at work and always gets shut off when she gets home so we can talk, cook, and do something together unless she has solo plans.

            "input": "It all started 5 years ago when I would stream for fun. We met and talked for a long time and hit it off. We became super good friends and would text everyday and that eventually turned into a relationship. At the time she was working and not in college and I was in the middle of careers. After being together for 1 year we were able to move in together where I live (Different state), she was living in LA beforehand. I we were here for about 1 year, she took a community college course and worked some while I was still finding a job. When I found one in LA I was able to move down into a house where some other of the same employee's lived (kind of like a dorm). She moved back with her parents and continued schooling. It became an online relationship somewhat as our schedules did not meet that well and neither of us had cars to easily get to eachother. We texted a lot during the day about what we are doing and always looked forward to the future. This continued for around 3 years, we were able to meet during breaks and sometimes have 1 whole month of living together. I actually have messaged \"Goodmorning love\" or something along those lines alongside \"Goodnight love\" for over 4 years.\n \n \n3 Months ago my career took a big turn, we still talked and got to meet occasionally and definitely were still in love, but I was not sure if I was going to be able to stay within LA. 1.5 months ago I had to move away, she was there the final week with me during this time. I told her I am going to do everything I can to make myself successful, she only had 1-2 years left in school and we would finally get rid of this online relationship. I messaged a lot about what I was doing and would sometimes ask about her. On december 14th she messaged saying how she loved me and misses me so much, she woke up at 4am and could not sleep, she wished to cuddle me and feel safe because she really enjoyed being with me. By december 18th she was messaging less and less, and told me that she was depressed and starting to ask me questions like \"Don't you ever wonder if we were not together?, if we would be more successful?\" I am a pretty analytical person and said no i dont have those thoughts because it's impossible to know, but i definitely am happy I am with her. I would say goodmorning love, goodnight love, every day (for years as i mentioned), she did too. She stopped at december 18th completely. She would say \"morning\". I would tell her I want to help her feel better, I wish I could hug and kiss her to make her feel better. She enjoys messages about what I am currently doing. I would send pictures too because she liked that too. She would never respond really, I would ask how she was and said \"the same, i am tired.\", she said \"I am tired of everything. I don't want to do anything in life.\" I told her we are both in bad places right now but let's stick through it and get through this. Love her miss her etc. Send some pics of myself, tell her hey you were going to the gym not long ago and you stopped, I bet it would make you feel better! This was basically the story up until yesterday. Last week she said she wanted to break up over a message. I said hey let's talk about this, we have had low low's before but always came out of it. We have been together very long and message every day for years and I believe we can make it better. She in the past has always talked about wanting to talk via phone / comms. I would agree but never get around to it. Not that I would put it off, in fact if she ever asked I would of said yes! But she never, ever did. I would need to be the one to ask, if I did not ask then no call happened. She would get upset at me for not calling. I say hey let's not make rash decisions, less than one month ago you said you loved me so much and you said you have depression right now. I want to help. She said she didn't want to hold me back from anything in life and said goodbye. I messaged the next day asking for a phone call because 5 years of relationship ended over a message did not sit well. And what she said was not true, I worked hard to make it so we would have a bright future together. She said that from my constant messages about wanting to call and I am confused that I was pissing her off and she wanted time to think. I said okay and left one final message because I just wanted to let her know that her thoughts of me being held back were wrong, that we have been through rough times, and that I know I could of been a better boyfriend by giving her those calls and was willing to do it now more than ever. It was the biggest time where I was like holy shit I love her lots and this is happening. I believed it would be okay. She replied back 2 days later after those thoughts saying she is done. In my messaged I actually said not 5 years and she pointed that out which seems that she was offended. (I said 4+ years). She said I \"had 5 years\" and that \"she is tired\", that I \"had my chance but it's over\", and \"in the future maybe we will meet again, but right now I am not willing to try again with you\", alongside an sorry and don't message me for a while. I was shocked.. how did this happen so fast? I pleaded for a phone call because I was confused, she made it seem that the past 5 years were hell. I had many great times with her but from that final message it made it seem that I messed up. After some pleading about asking for the call, and some back and forth about how she said I talked about myself when messaging her and not asking about her. (I thought she just enjoyed listening about what I am doing because she asked me to tell her...) She eventually said to completely stop before she blocks me and that me messaging more would ruin any tiny chance of the future. I am still young and immature but this was really hard on me. I will continue trying to be successful in my life but this was my first really long relationship and I didn't expect less than a month ago that I would be here today. I could of done better but I felt I wasn't the worst and we both could of made it work. I honestly don't know what advice I am asking for here, I feel very lost and confused. I won't be the type of guy who comes crawling back in a week, I know how she is and what is done is done. I just have very recent memories of her and it was wonderful and so recent, I don't know how things turned so quick.\n \n \nJust scrolling through some of past messages in december there were messages about how she appreciated me sending messages and pictures during her hard time, and that she wont respond sometimes not because she doesnt want to but doesnt have the energy to. She also said that she was planning to get rid of the people in her life that won't help her grow as a person and wasn't afraid to cut ties with anyone (including me) to do so. And that she appreciated me trying to help her through her rough time and she hopes I continue to do so. And at the end that she hopes that I can continue being in her life and helping her grow.... I just don't understand how it got to this point still.\n \nAny advice I guess is appreciated. I am still in shock over this series of events, I felt the relationship was not going this poorly.\n\n",

She's promising me that nothings going to happen between them and that they're just going to be walking around and hanging out outdoors.

She asked me out and we dated for a solid 3 months.

The concept was pretty simple- Every monday, I send a math problem to the school (there's a mailing list with all students and faculty) and the following Monday I announce the winners. It was just something I came up with which I thought would be fun. The first few weeks went ok, but one day, a new student decided to ask the riddle on StackOverflow and tried to submit someone else's solution as his own. His solution was slightly edited in some places, and he specifically stated in the email he sent to me that \"this is *my* solution\". It was a pretty clear cut case of plagiarism.\n\nThe Math Monday program was still in its infancy. I had sent an email about the rules beforehand but I hadn't considered cases of plagiarism in the rules, so I considered being more lenient.\n\nAs I saw it, I had 2 options:\n\n1-Talk to him about it privately. Don't make a big fuss, just quietly let him know its not okay to cheat.\n\n2-Expose his plagiarism to the school to send a strong message that plagiarism is never okay.\n\nAs you can tell from the title of this post, I did the latter. I spoke to a few friends about it beforehand and they thought I should send the email so I did it.\nThis kicked up a lot of drama at school the following day. \n\nEventually, the student who cheated sent a shitty apology mail saying he didn't know cheating wasn't allowed. It was a very poorly worded apology and just reading it made me cringe and feel bad for him.\n\nHowever, things get even worse. The head of Administrative Affairs( dont remember his exact title, but he's a highly respected/feared faculty member that nobody messes with) replied to the cheater's email basically roasting him for his insincere apology. This made everything 10 times worse and I immediately regretted making things escalate to this level when I could've just given the boy a personal talking to. The fact that he was a new student still adjusting to dorm life) it was a boarding school) made things worse still.\n\nThe strict teachers all supported my decision but most of my friends gave me shit for doing it. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\n",

We've been together and married for approximately 4.5 years after waiting only a few months to get married. We communicate often, and well.  We trust each other, completely. Any time an ex might slide into DM's for any reason, it's brought forward. \n\nI admittedly read A LOT of r/relationship_advice. Idk why, really. Call it a guilty pleasure. I get tired of the typical mundane droll that is FB, IG, etc, so I often turn to Reddit for something more stimulating.\n\nTo get to the point, I started to see a pattern in the last several days on RA where the OP's cite that their significant other was cheating after several years (lets say 6+) of supposed monogamy, and they claimed to have not known their were any issues in their relationship that would have caused the SO to act out in that way. \n\nThis, in turn, prompted me to shoot my hubs a text to \"check the oil\" on our marriage, as it were. We had a baby a few months ago, (my first, his third- we have custody of his other two) and we've been adjusting to the changes, of course. I asked him if there was anything he needed, or was lacking from me, whether it be doing more around the house, doing more things with him, or yes, even physical aspects of our relationship. This lead to him saying no, he's good (to paraphrase) and then make jokes about more sexual acts, of which I will spare you.\n\nOkay, cool. \n\nI pick up the baby from my mom's, and am on the way home when I realize that, heyyyy, he never asked me if I was good. He answered my question with \"nope, we're good, more sex.\" And went about his way. So I point this out, and he replies with \"oh, so we're fighting today. LoL jk jk.\" \n\nWe talked it out once I got home, and he claims to have been planning to have a sincere conversation about it once all of the kids were in bed for the night. Maybe true, maybe just something an inconsiderate husband might say to cover his ass. \n\nAITA for being miffed about the fact that he was seemingly unconcerned about my feelings until I pointed it out?

I paid my expenses, boyfriend paid for his, my parents in law (PIL) paid for BIL &amp; SIL. I left over some money so when I would come back to USA I would have money for my bills and I wouldn\u2019t be struggling until my next paycheck. \n\n       Anyways, on the day that we leave back to USA, it turns out our tickets didn\u2019t include our bags so we had to pay around 75$ each for our bags. I paid for mine, no problem. But then my bf realizes he doesn\u2019t have enough to pay for them 3. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that my father in law had wanted my bf to throw a farewell party the day before we left, with their family members... which left them with no money.  My bf did not want to throw the party but his father insisted. Anyway, he asked me if I could let him borrow the 3500 pesos (around 188$) I had left to pay for his siblings bags. I was hesitant at first because it was all the money I had left, but my bf and my BIL promised me that their father would pay me back since it was for BIL &amp; SIL. \n\n         I paid for their luggage and came back to USA with 0$ to my name. I ended up having a negative balance on my card and I\u2019ve been trying to recover from this trip for a while now. Now it\u2019s been almost two months, and I ask my boyfriend when my PIL  are going to pay me back because I could really use my money, and he tells me he will ask his parents again. \n\n      Today he asked his mom when they will pay me back and she got angry. She said I am very \u201cfijada\u201d which roughly translates to I\u2019m very ungrateful. She says because sometimes I eat at their house, why am I charging them for the luggage fees and that they will start charging me for things too. My bf defended me saying that I buy my siblings in law food at times too, when I owe them money I pay them on time, etc. Plus to her, damn near 200$ may not seem like a lot, but for a 20 year old who gets paid 400$ working a part-time, it\u2019s almost half my paycheck! Does she think I shit money? I could of easily said no and let my BIL and SIL leave their luggages in Mexico but I didn\u2019t and I came back with 0$ to my name and had to end up even borrowing money to pay my bills. \n\n     So Reddit, am I an asshole for wanting my PIL to pay me back? I admit I do eat at their house at times, and my MIL gifts me clothes from her store, but again I do not ask her to give me things, and if eating at their house is such a big deal I will stop. My boyfriend currently lost his job so I\u2019ve been helping him financially too. I\u2019ve been helping her son but she still thinks I\u2019m ungrateful. Am I really an asshole? ",

I mean she's married for god's sake, let her be a goddamn adult!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I have mental health issues and sometimes I need to just go home and just...not do shit.  It's not a problem for most people because they understand the concept of running out of spoons mentally (I don't make a habit out of this and I try to only do this when I am really REALLY drained and I think the activity would make things worse), but for my parents it's a mortal sin.  I did this for the first time ever last week and they are calling me \"selfish\" over it.  But my body just couldn't handle it.

The issue is that my sister, partly due to the issues above, also said she couldn't go to this dinner and my parents just assumed I was going.

Dad and his son are an outspoken black activist and I\u2019m white so we usually disagree yet we have civil conversation that are productive and get along real well with bad blood till last weekend.\n\nWe are planning on replacing a fence between our land so we drew up a contract splitting the cost and putting it right down the middle of the line. The current fence was put up off eyeballing the line. Over time it became crooked and beat up so I had a surveyor come out and confirm the property line and found out that I actually gained a foot of property from him.\n\nI invite him over Saturday to break him the news. Fast forward he got on the topic that his family lived on the property for generations and should just use the current fence line that the guy who owned my place before made. I told him we would be using the one from the survey since it\u2019s legally my property and if he wanted to get a second opinion then he can and we would wait to move the fence. He said he wouldn\u2019t pay to have a white man take more property from him. Its pretty important and can cost a lot more to move a fence after it\u2019s build I assumed he would want to confirm it. He kept saying no and left.\n\nOn sunday while I was working over by the fence, his son who\u2019s 19, come over ask why I \u201cthought it was ok that a white man can take a black mans land just cause of some paper\u201d i explained that property lines aren\u2019t theft and it changed the value which set him off and how I\u2019m taking money from them like my ancestors took everything. I got heated by being called a racist and told him my family fled Italy during WW2 to poor Detroit and wasn\u2019t involved in his history at all. Basically the whole reparation issue was stupid and he\u2019s crazy for using all white people argument since my family came in 1940\u2019s. He walked away after I said that if the roles were reversed they wouldn\u2019t have a problem and race shouldn\u2019t be involved. (basically he's acting crazy)\n\nNext time I saw them the son glared at me and the dad was pissed I fought with his son but knew he provoked me. We made friendly until he asked what I decided on the fence. I kinda chuckled and said were using the legal one. He was dumbfounded and I asked if he was crazy that I wouldn\u2019t want to add more property. He got pissed and walked off after saying that he won\u2019t pay for the fence and he wants his money back then and now we aren\u2019t talking. Should I move forward with the contract or AITA\n\nTdlr: I get my property surveyed before replacing a fence and gains a foot and upsets my neighbors who blame me for being racist and stealing land.

Our buddy and coworker (I work with my boyfriend, family business) was going through a tough time and recently broke up with his fiancee, so we figured, hey this could probably work out! He was renting a room elsewhere and was crashing on our couch more often than not, so when we got the place he moved in with us. The only rule was that we listen to loud music, and that won't change, and he needed to be okay with that. He heard how loud our music was before he moved in so he said it wouldn't be a problem. My boyfriend and I put our names on the lease and he rented a room and we split the rent in half with him, but we pay for the utilities.\n\nEverything was alright for the first 4 months, he would kind of clean up after himself, he'd interact with people that came over, and be really appreciative when I cleaned the house and when my boyfriend would cook us dinner. \n\nThen he got comfortable. He stopped cleaning up after himself completely, he stopped offering to make dinner, and eventually started expecting that dinner would be made for him all the time. (We would go over to a friend's, have dinner with them, and come home at 830pm and he'd ask \"did you guys already eat? Oh, I guess I'll make something for myself\") Our music didn't change, but his whining about the volume increased. It's almost as if he felt entitled to everything we do for him.\n\nFast forward to last night. Our roomie hurt his knee, so he stayed home all day by himself. We came home around 530 and we started cooking and cleaning. My boyfriend just finished cooking an amazing meal, and I was uncharacteristically drunk.  I was eating while reading my book and rocking out to my favourite band. Roomie comes down taps my google home and shuts off the music, without asking to turn it down beforehand, and said \"I'm sorry but I'm irritated, I'm getting really sick of all this music.\" And then goes upstairs. I'm irrational in my drunken state and I looked at my boyfriend and told him to deal with it, since I felt like I couldn't without blowing up. \n\nMy bf goes up and talks to him and reminded him that this was the deal. We wanted loud music when we had our own place and that's what was happening. We would have been respectful if he asked about turning down the music, which he never did, he'd just complain about it. \"I don't remember you guys telling me anything like that.\" Which we did. Literally our only rule. And he goes on to say \"well maybe you guys would be better off on your own.\" Bf: \"fine then, move out.\" Roomie: \"GOOD.\"\n\nWhile I have been growing increasingly exasperated with him, this isn't what I wanted to happen. If anything we were going to wait to talk to him until we renewed the lease. I know that my frustrations were starting to come out in full force, i haven't been a saint in the situation, and I was even planning on having a talk with him about his cleanliness so that it would make the rest of the year run out smoothly.

She also needs my help after a small surgery... I dont live nearby and I just really want her to ask someone else. I technically can drop everything and help her but I dont want to.  \nI already know I'm an asshole.. but let me explain.   I dont care for my family, they're all backwards hicks and I hate being on the phone or going to lunch... I have a mom and a brother.  My bro is 6 years older and my mom was a single mom... she spent more time at work than home which was respectable until I turned 11, my bro moved out, my mom was sick of *doing everything* and I was sent off to the country to live with her abusive redneck drinking buddies. I lived with (different) other people from 11 to 17 (including a bf from 14 to 17)  then dropped out of school and ran off to 3 other states before finding a home in California for 12 years. My mom visited often, she became a truck driver to follow her dreams when she sent me off... I got homesick sometimes because it was 12 years and I forgave my mom for a while, she was someone I'd go out of my way to meet and i included her in xmas stuff. \nThen she had her stroke, wiped out the right half of her mobility, shes in pain, the meds make her emotional and... rude.  I was so worried in California, every phone call sounded like she was being tortured by everyone trying to help her... I felt horrible so I actually give up my job and home in cali and made my daughter leave her world to come live with and help my mom.   Now I had to get a job, then an apartment, and I got both quickly but maybe only because my mom called 6 times a day for status reports and asking what the hold up is.  I arrived in October and had an apartment by xmas. Moved her in, and became her fucking slave.  She treated my daughter like crap, acted like everything in the world revolved around her stroke, brings up politics and god entirely too much, cried daily over how unfair it all was... but mostly I couldn't leave my 12 year daughter alone with her, she was so mean and on xmas told my daughter she would always be a horrible person... yeah my baby cried and shes not horrible, I blame the meds, my mom changed after this stroke. She will admit she was a beast, so I swear I'm not exaggerating.  Anyway, she got sick of ME and decided to move back to the place I *saved* her from and by then I was done... I maxed out all my credit cards to get to Texas and help her and she lasted 2 months in my care.. I dont call, I hate her voice, and on top of just being uncomfortable seeing my mom in this condition I'm really angry that she would insist I spend so much time and money to help her then not need me... describe me to people as a selfish punk.   I really wish I just never came back to help in the first place. I ruined my life, it's been 7 months since she had someone pick her and her things up. I couldn't afford nor wanted to keep that place or job so I quit everything and moved in with my travelling bf, my daughter is already homeschooled so we are always on the road now and it's been better than Texas but I'm still pissed that I did so much for my mom and it was just a total disaster..  so that's where I'm coming from, sorry of that's long.  ANYWAY she has a blockage in her leg and I assume it's an angioplasty coming up and she called me asking of I could come (currently in utah but maybe heading back to TX in a few weeks) because she needs help for a few days after the procedure.   I just... I honestly feel like when she dies it will be sad but a relief and that makes me feel like shit... I also dont know if these feelings are justified or if I'm just horrible now.  Should I do it?  I havent told her how I feel.  Also she wants help with money and I'm not finding work on the road for extra cash and I wont be asking my bf for money to help her... she sounds so miserable on the phone but I hesitate to feel sorry for her.  I really dont have much family, I dont want to hate them, but 3 or 4 days with her might be too much for me.  I'm kind of looking for justifiable reasons not to feel obligated to ever help her again.   ",

It would be the next step up for me in job level and a bump in pay but come with a lot of travel.  I went through many calls with the recruiter who was excellent and covered the travel portion of the job extremely thoroughly.  The VP who would be my boss flew out to meet me and took my wife and I out to dinner to make sure we were ok with the travel as a family.  They flew me out to their HQ the next week (this week) and went through another round of interviews before they made me an offer yesterday.  \n\nThey had a great idea as to what I make now and made a offer about 10-12% above that.  Not exactly what I was hoping for but I was prepared to negotiate a low ball.  I spoke to the recruiter (who was negotiating the offer with me) thanked him for the consideration, informed him I wanted a little time to consider the offer against all options and it would be helpful to know if there was any flexibility in the offer and when they needed an answer back by as the offer letter did not have a expiration date.  No date was given but he said there was flexibility and we agreed to talk again in the morning.  \n\nWe spoke this morning around 10.  I told him given the amount of travel and home life impacts my wife and I agree we were both looking for more money to make the time away worth it.  I was prepared to accept a good offer but the +10% offer was at the extreme low end of my expectations.  I felt there was an extra 5-10% on the table.  Keep in mind this is for a high level sales position, speaking with the VP of sales through the recruiter.  We end the call with the recruiter going back to the VP.

He\u2019s 27 and I\u2019m 25. We don\u2019t really have arguments but one of the only things that seems to really bother him in our relationship is the fact that I don\u2019t do my own taxes. My father has always been the one who handles finances in my family so every year I give him the necessary paperwork and forms and he just files it for me. He does this for everyone in my family (including my grandma, siblings, and mother) because although he is not diagnosed my siblings and I are convinced he has some level of OCD or anxiety and likes for things to be very particular and done \u201chis way\u201d. I never complained or put up a fight about it because I don\u2019t see a reason to have to worry about doing my own taxes when my dad is more than willing to do it for me. If my dad one day did decide that he didn\u2019t want to file my taxes for me than I would be more than willing to suck it up and do it myself. Last year during tax season my boyfriend unexpectedly freaked out when he heard me talking over the phone with my mom telling her I mailed dad my W2s and got very upset when I confronted him about it. I never gave it much thought but he\u2019s outright told me that he thinks it\u2019s really weird that my dad does this for me and that I\u2019m so dependent on him. I see where he\u2019s coming from, but I thought he was being way too dramatic about the whole thing. While he\u2019s not estranged from his family, he is not close with his parents and moved out when he was 17 and is very independent (I on the other hand am very close to my family and didn\u2019t move out until I was 23) so again I can see why this confuses him.\n\nA few days ago I received my W2s for this tax year. My boyfriend made an offhand comment about if I was planning to do my own taxes this year to which I told him that I was probably just going to let my dad file them again this year. He immediately got huffy and kept asking me over and over again why I just didn\u2019t do my own and that he would be happy to show me how. I explained that I didn\u2019t want to have to worry about it and that\u2019s it\u2019s just easier to have my dad do them for me. He then asked if I didn\u2019t trust him enough to show me how to properly file my taxes and asked what I would do if we got married. This threw me off. Of course I trust him, he\u2019s been doing his own taxes since he was 17 and of course if we got married I\u2019d file our taxes together, but no matter how many times I tried to explain myself he didn\u2019t seem to understand that this is just a matter of convenience and it\u2019s so much easier to let my dad handle it than worry with it myself and then have my dad fret over whether or not it was filed properly. He then stormed off to the bedroom effectively ending the conversation. We\u2019ve been tiptoeing around the subject and haven\u2019t talked about it since.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know. Am I the asshole for not letting him help me with my taxes and just sending it to my dad to take care of, or is he reading way too much into the whole situation? Please help.",

With her, as a woman in her twenties, constantly needing to ask for permission to do basically anything.\n\n\n\nIt has improved a lot, with her becoming much more assertive and independent but one things still really bothering me. At the point when we had been living together around for around 7 months her parents  (who were in a longstanding legal battle with the US government over their citizenship rights) heard that the next hearing was going ahead and assumed they would win the case within that month,  despite me, my girlfriend, the lawyer,  and their oldest son trying to explain that this was only one step in a long process.\n\n\n\nWith this they decided they would spend their time before moving back to the USA  seeing the sights in Europe.  The problem was that they drained my girlfriends bank account to do it. (It was an account she made as a minor so her mom had access)\n\nWhen it came out that they won the case but another date was scheduled they exploded and blamed the lawyer and said it was his fault my girlfriends life savings were now non existent. \n\n\nAs I've said, over time she has gotten a lot more assertive and in return her parents have started treating her more like an adult. \n\n\nNow we're left being solely reliant on my income and savings and it honestly makes me furious.\nAny time I bring it up with her she says \"it doesn't matter\" and any time I voice my concern over feeling like I'm the only one putting resources into this relationship she blames her parents.

I felt embarassed all day and felt bad about disrespecting him because meeting him was such a big life moment for me but my girlfriend said over and over he knew I was joking. \n\nA couple days later the panel got posted to youtube (I can link if anyone is interested) and there were comments saying that I was way in the wrong and I'm the type of person that contributes to the anxiety Chris has talked about having in the past.

These have caused serious turmoil in my house for as long as I can remember. Like, argue until 3 am with my parents, visits to the ER, and leaving the house in the middle of the night. My mental health issues have also caused monetary issues with my family (my parents are very vocal about this), as I see three different mental health professionals for different reasons. \n\nMy sister does not struggle with mental health, but she does struggle with her physical health. Three weeks before her 14th birthday, she had to get pretty serious jaw surgery (the recovery was rough, and six months later, her swelling is just now fading). She also has severe scoliosis, which requires her to go to a special center for physical therapy and wear a (very expensive, like $2,000 expensive) back brace. \n\nI have noticed that there has never been any discussion around the expenses of my sister's health issues, and it stirs up some of my serious anxiety. I feel like I am a burden on my family, but I know that in reality, her heath costs are double mine, yet for some reason, I'm the person who has to hear about the costs they cause the family. \n\nI don't resent my sister for getting treated differently.

I know we have HEAPS of time before we even think about who will be present at the birth but I don't want to offend my MIL by blocking her out just because of my mum, but at the same time I want to share that special experience with my mother. I thknk her own mother wasn't able to be at my birth, which may have something to do with it.\n\nI just want everyone to be happy and enjoy the event. It only happens once.",

It was like 20 small pets (like four dogs, a few cats I think, and small exotic reptiles etc) but recently she got WAY MORE. Like a lot more. I saw pictures of at least 15 different animals in the past few days but she has admitted openly to 52 within the past two days.\n\nShe provides what I believe may be the minimal amount of care (she feeds them and takes them to the vet) but from what I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s gross in her house. Her parents bankroll the house this girl lives in and she CAN afford it all but it\u2019s...52 animals! On top of that, she wants MORE because some of her animals need \u201cfriends\u201d for mental health purposes. In a way I\u2019m glad she\u2019s thinking of specific animals that probably need companions so they aren\u2019t depressed being alone (like some animals really do live better in packs) but that number is excessive and I\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019s illegal here. I can\u2019t find any specifics on how many of each specific animal is illegal in a house hold or if there is even a specific law regarding a person having that many animals if they provide decent care but I don\u2019t believe she is if it\u2019s as gross as what people say cleanliness wise. \n\nNow on top of all of that my friend is scared that she can\u2019t get her pet snake that was being fostered by this girl back. She didn\u2019t have near this many animals when she started fostering my friends snake but now that it\u2019s 52 she wants her snake, who has respiratory issues, back but hoarder girl has refused and also blocked her.

We have a shared interest in gaming and often get together with other friends. \n\nMike unfortunately has a tendency to have outburst when he loses games or someone plays a game a way he doesn't approve of. One time I invited a new friend over only for him to yell at him when he lost a game. When I confronted him over this, he admitted to having a form of autism which causes him to have fits of anger and other issues. \n\nFor awhile I tried to be more understanding but I constantly had to deal with the fact that often he would just act out and make things super awkward for everyone else there. I didn't want to not be his friend anymore because we would often get along well when he wasn't having his fits and I would feel like a dick cutting someone off with a behavioral disorder.\n\nOne thing that sort of irked me is that when I would bring things up that he did, he would always blame the autism, rarely apologize, and not really change much.\n\nRecently he lashed out at me over a very small arguement to the point of questioning if I am even a good friend to him.  That really bothered me because I have always been there for him , through his various medical, relationship and financial problems.

In these situations there was zero ambiguity about which cat he was referring to, as Tommi would be right in front of us and Roger would be off sleeping somewhere.\n\nAt first I would correct him passively. For example if he\u2019d say \u201cHe\u2019s a mischievous one\u201d I\u2019d say \u201cyeah, she is pretty rambunctious\u201d. Often after this, dad would say something along the lines of \u201cyes, she\u201d, indicating (to me) that he saw his mistake and wanted to correct it. As days went on and he continued to make this mistake (often multiple times a day, even after getting it right a few times), my corrections sometimes became more direct. He\u2019d say \u201cHe has such a high voice\u201d and I\u2019d just say \u201cshe\u201d. He\u2019d respond \u201cyes, she\u201d. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t correct him at all, but the majority of the time I did.\n\nThere were times that he seemed to be either drilling her gender into his head or showing me he could get it right by unnecessarily mentioning her gender to her.

There are women called Tomi, though I will admit that it\u2019s more commonly a man\u2019s nickname (Tommy).\n\nThere is nothing mentally wrong with my father, I should note.

We eloped with only the two of us, our officiant, and our photographer in attendance.   \n\n\nBefore I hired the photographer, I had a meeting with her and told her that there were certain parts of my body I was very insecure about, and being plus sized, I needed a photographer who could accommodate that. She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day.   \n\n\nWe paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver.  Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed.   \n\n\nWhen we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February.  I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding.   \n\n\nThe wedding came and went, and it was beautiful. I got a few watermarked sneak peaks, and I was super excited to get the rest. I few weeks later, I contacted her about the image without the watermark so I could send out announcements. She told me she would have to edit it. She never sent it. I left it alone, because at point, it had been 6ish weeks since the wedding, and I was supposed to have them within 60 days. The 60 day mark passed and I didn't hear from her, so I sent her a message asking for an update, and she told me that they weren't ready yet.   \n\n\nI received my pictures today after two and a half months.

We both live in the same city.  Her parents (my husbands parents) live in a small town about a 5 hour drive away.  I'm very close with their parents. Both families frequently visit the Grandparents, and sometimes we take each others kids with us (but not always).  Although, because my kids are younger - we take their kids more than they take ours (they've never taken our youngest).  Which is fine - he's a toddler, so I get it. \n\nIt was Christmas break, and both families were planning on spending Christmas break at the Grandparents house.  My husband, SIL and her husband all had one week of vacation.  I was lucky and had 2 weeks of vacation.  \n\nMy niece (the 9 year old) was having some problems with her parents (fighting a lot), so my SIL had actually sent her to the Grandparents early.  So she would be there for a total of 3 weeks. \n\nWith my extra week of vacation, I decided that I wanted to head to the Grandparents house a week early as well (my niece was already there at this point).  The primary reason I wanted to go early was because I wanted to put my older son in ski lessons before everybody else got there for Christmas break. My SIL's family does not ski at all. \n\nI contemplated inviting my nephew to go with us, but then I decided not to bring him.  I feel terrible because the other 3 grandchildren all got to be at their grandparents house together, and he was stuck in daycare by himself.   I also felt a bit bad because there was a slight precedent for bringing the other families kids with us (although I actually hate this precedent!).  My SILs family does almost always offer to take my older son with them when they go, and guarantee that they would have offered to take my (older) son if the situation was reversed. \n\nI didn't want to bring him for 3 main reasons.  ONE:  I thought it would be kind of awkward for my son (age 4) to be in ski lessons all week, when his cousin (age 5) wasn't.   TWO:  The drive is was 5 hours of dangerous mountain winter driving.  I am a nervous driver anyway and was already stressed about the drive with just my 2 kids.  I honestly didn't want another kid in the car.   THREE:  Honestly - I didn't want to look after him for a week.  I wanted to have a week of vacation with my kiddos.  Inviting him would mean the adults would be outnumbered 4:3, which is not a huge deal, but also adds up to slightly more work for everyone. \n\n\nAnyway - AITA?  For what it's worth, my husband thinks I am. \n\n",

Here's the background i met this girl in my college club, she was chill, we have a number of mutual interest and we later end up hitting it off. We spend the entire week hanging with each other, she comes over to my place, we smoke, she is vibing with me and all seems well. I feel a strong connection but not too invested. Anyway we make plans to meet up on friday(further context she wanted to repay me for something by smoking me out on friday but i ran into her two days earlier so we hung out then) but i thought it was off since we had already smoked before. But she text me asking what am i doing? i ignore it due to the fact she had ignored my previous text the day before after replying to the previous text before that one and not wanting to seem to desperate.   \n\n\nAs i'm walking to my next meeting, i happen to run into her and she of course ask if i got her text, i say no, she ask if i'm doing anything i say no and she bypasses me visibly upset so i ask her what she is doing and she says nothing. I tell her text me after 1 when i'm done with my meeting(she assumes this means she can come over later), we end up meeting again around 1 and she says she will be over after 3pm. I readily agreed despite being completely unprepared(apartment is not clean enough, no food in the fridge etc basically i was struggling) but i run home get everything nice, she comes over. She is vibing and dancing, but we quickly hit a road block she wants to watch a movie or play a game, my xbox live is off at the time, which is cool for me i was busy playing rdr2 which she has but doesnt want to play because spoilers and i didn't have netflix due to some other issues. I did have amazon prime but none of the horror films she wanted to watch were available, finally she tells me to look up youtube vids and she plays on her phone.   \n\n\nSo at this point her jackets back on, she is on the couch but i'm in the chair away from her and it's not going well. She however ask me to come with her to pick up some weed, from her ex room mate/guy she thinks is madly in love with her/suburban plug i agree but she has severe anxiety issues and i make the smart decision to make an offhanded comment about her driving ability(to be fair her turns did scare me) and where did she learn to drive which she took offensively. Que long spiral of annoyance, her yelling at me to just stop talking, other issues and eventually me getting kicked out of her car. She brought me back home, apologized for yelling, i got all into my drake feelings and said it's cool in hopped out. So at this point our chill session is a flaming hellhole of disaster, i basically call it quits on the entire thing and just try to go full relaxation with her hoping when she gets back maybe i can salvage it. She came back because i invited her to a house party later that night, we smoke a blunt, play a little music but i can tell from her general vibe she is done with me and vice versa her attention is nominally on my room mate and I'm a after thought.   \n\n\nI accept this and focus on the party ahead. So we roll up to the party with drinks and weed, her and my room mate don't know anybody(neither do i) so they crowd around me as i make my way into the kitchen and luckily run into some fellow club presidents from the school i had literally met the day before but they show me love. I immediately get into the right state of mind and pull out drinks to start mixing. She ends up downstairs smoking weed for the night talking to this pothead(really cool guy), i end up getting wasted and becoming shot bros with every one, my room mate gets the wall flower treatment(which is shitty on my part, i should have tried to chaperone him more effectively but i didn't know anyone at the party and i was too drunk at that point to introduce him people, plus he was not smoking or drinking so i had no avenues open to get him into the right mood) and i end up taking weird drugs for the first time ever and having a lot of fucking fun. Which later turns into me being a drunken asshole apparently according to the people i brought with me, i end up getting in her face about some weed, which she says i tried to take out of her hand, i was aggressive, asked her to drunkenly dance with me and some other bullshit. Oh i also apparently whined or cried like a bitch to a couple people at the party about \"relationship issues\" which she caught ear of and put me further on her shit list.   \n\n\nI also said i would never fuck her, called her by a different girls name, said the girl who invited me was awesome and totally dtf which i forgot how but it led to me saying i would never fuck her. I then spent like 30 minutes drunkenly yelling at my room mates door trying to cock block him, out of a deep insecurity he would make a move on her(he didn't he is totally uninterested in her but i was drunk so eh) and finally he told her to sleep in his room. Which i should've done but i fucked up. So she spends the night, the next day she still wanted to hang over and smoke but she did not have a lighter. I apologized, but i also denied the extent of me being a drunken asshole to them both. I sent a apology meme which was hilarious, she has since been ignoring me for about a week or two now. I saw her once since then but quickly looked away, not sure if she saw me or not, positive she did and maybe she is mad even more because she thought i ignored her idk. Anyway i have come to the conclusion yes i was being an asshole but i did send a heartfelt apology. Maybe i don't deserve forgiveness but i'm desperately thinking about calling her and i just need some advice. Should i?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I figured then out someone might have access to my Gmail, and managed to log him off through my phone, at this point i had no idea who did this.  \n\n\nJust a moment after all this i get a message on snapchat from A that the post i made was funny, then i realised it was him because we were not friends on facebook, i asked him how he knew what my post sounded like since we were not friends, and he tried to tell me some one else( i have no idea who he was talking about, certainly not one of my facebook friends) told him. That was the moment i realised it was him.  \n\n\nSo i go to the only teacher we both had to complain about A and he said to me he would talk to him first thing next morning(it was the last class of the day).  \n\n\nThe next morning my teacher talked to A and told him to not do things like this again, then A came up to me and apologised, but i did not want to accept this because this stressed me so much out and i cant handle stress very well.  \n\n\nTL:DR i forgot to log out of my Gmail and he changed my facebook password twice, posted something on my facebook and had full access to my Gmail.  \n\n\nSo AITA for not accepting his Apology?",

We both came together at a point in our lives So this happened sometime ago, during Christmas. My husband and I are not well off. We both came together at a point in our lives where we had nothing or very little, but we were full of love and acceptance. We have gotten help from friends and family for things like an old couch that no one wants and is quite frankly uncomfortable. We accepted a used mattress because it was literally all we could get. I\u2019m not kidding you, people came together to help us with so much, but a lot of stuff was just old, broken unwanted things that we could make do with. Silverware,  nightstands, cups, clothes, you name it! We graciously accepted whatever we could in those first few months so that we didn\u2019t have to sit, sleep, and eat off the floor.\n\nFast forward a few years and yeah, we\u2019re still poor but hey! We make do, save money to buy what we can (we got a new mattress!!) and live with what we have (still have the awful couch). We know what we NEED and we know what we want, and we make it very clear that we don\u2019t want frivolous expenditures as gifts when that money could be better spent. Obviously we are always grateful for gifts, like my husband was given a google pixel xl from his brother (who at the time was extremely well to do) some 2 years ago after his current phone died that he still uses. My MIL upgraded her phone and let me have her old one, just in time since my previous phone screen SHATTERED. What I\u2019m trying to say is I never ask for anything that would not help our situation and don\u2019t go asking for support unless we are in dire straits. Much of the time, people ask us if we could use an item that they no longer want which can be extremely helpful. We make miracles happen and pull through. \n\nSO! Christmas! We get little for each other since we\u2019re often strapped for cash, and do what we can for family and friends. Sometimes it\u2019s just a card with a lotto ticket. Sometimes we make food and gift that. Once my husband made personal drawn cards for our friends and they loved it. We always let people know that we don\u2019t expect gifts, especially because we can\u2019t afford to give back every time. One year his brother goes on a last minute spending spree and gets everyone something pricey. It was wonderful seeing their mother enjoy her beautiful present, and although the nieces and nephews weren\u2019t there that year I\u2019m sure they loved theirs as well. BIL then brings ours, which looks like a tv. Now, we already have a tv. It\u2019s by no means huge, I think it\u2019s maybe 38, 42 inches and it\u2019s either plasma or lcd (whatever, it\u2019s thin ok?). But this tv works great, just peachy keen. We got this one technically from BIL because he had given it to their father, who then passed away. So he let us have it since he had a 50 inch smart tv and had no use. \nCue me looking at this new smart tv, same size, same thickness, same everything except it\u2019s smart I guess. This tv was expensive, needlessly so, and he grabbed it as a last thought not as a planned gift. I awkwardly laugh and say \u201cBut we already have a tv?\u201d and of course \u201cThank you!\u201d, and \u201cIt\u2019s really cool, I\u2019m just not sure what to do with it\u201d which is true, what do you need two TVs for? Yes, I know that some people have one in their bedroom but that\u2019s not gonna happen since A: no plug outlet for it in there B: I don\u2019t watch tv in bed and I don\u2019t wanna start C: we don\u2019t even have cable, we just watch a few movies here and there using the computer we hook up. There are some awkward laughs and some awkward thank you\u2019s. Leaving the house and coming home I start in about how husband\u2019s brother is bad with money so often. How he could have used that money for anything else, not even just for us but for himself. I get beggy-choosey (I know that\u2019s what it is, no delusions there) about how if he really wanted to spend that much on a gift for us BIL could have asked what we needed. I\u2019d say a couch, or husbands glasses, or if he\u2019d offered, a bed frame since we actually still don\u2019t have a real one. These hypothetical gift ideas don\u2019t matter to me, I\u2019m just upset at this much money being thrown at nothing.\nHusband say something to MIL, like how we don\u2019t know what to do but sell the old tv so we don\u2019t have an extra for no reason. MIL decides to talk to BIL (without us knowing, this was NOT our idea) into returning the tv and just giving us the money. He is vehemently against this, which although I never wanted him to do this it rubs me the wrong way. We tell MIL don\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019re sorry we said anything, tell BIL the same. Months go by and before I get to selling it a friend says they need one (that\u2019s a whole other story) so I let them have it for free in a pay it forward manner. We use the smart tv, which has admittedly a better picture but is abysmally slow to turn on, and for some reason won\u2019t connect to anything anyway. Whatever, it\u2019s still a tv.\n\nWhat I want to know is, was I the asshole for being practical and realistic during Christmas? Everyone knows our situation and knows I don\u2019t want to be read as entitled just because of unnecessary spending. ",

I have countless great memories of me and him playing this game together, and I\u2019d be playing it with him right now if I could. I moved out on my own for the first time a year ago, and it means I do not have any spare money, and certainly not enough to ever be able to afford a new laptop in the near future at all in order to play. As I\u2019m typing this I hear the propane delivery truck outside and I already know there\u2019s a 200$ bill stuck to my door. Since over a year since I\u2019ve been able to play there been tons of new updates and whatnot, and I miss the game badly but there\u2019s not really anything I can do. \n\nMe and my boyfriend have been playing Xbox games together since I do have a functioning Xbox. He has a functioning computer unlike myself so he technically can play the game i miss, but he doesn\u2019t without me, and he doesn\u2019t talk about it because there\u2019s no point. We simply just have to wait however many years it takes for me to be financially secure enough in able to afford a gaming laptop ( or just one of any kind ) and he\u2019s patient and nice about it. My best friend also use to play this game with me, and recently she decided to reinstall the game and play. I have no problem with that, all I did was simply as her if she could not talk about it with me as it saddens me I can\u2019t play anymore, but she\u2019s decided to be rude and sarcastic about it, taking my request in the wrong way. Specifically, I asked her the first time to please not talk about it as it upsets me. She decided she didn\u2019t care and continued, so I got angry and was more stern this time.

We all disagree, and apparently jerry has been starting drama over the simplest thing for a very long time. (I'm going to spare you the details up until now) And now, he sends me a message about 2 weeks since the last drama and he says pretty much this: \"Hey, its been like a year since we last hung out. Can we please call and play games for a while? Ive been trying to play with you for so long and i really want to be your friend\" And i say this in return: \"I've been trying to tell you not so harshly, but i guess i have to do it bluntly; I do not like being around you because you try to start drama with literally every single thing anyone says\" And he starts going on this long rant about how im a bully for not wanting to be around him, and i keep replying saying that hes the one starting drama, and he keeps saying \"BULLY BULLY\" To me making valid arguments.

We spend a lot of time together because he was on break from classes and I was on break from teaching.

However, during these months we kept in pretty constant contact with texting and video-calling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem came though when he took on a job in his home country which caused him to travel from country to country pretty frequently. When he took on this job, I asked him if he'd like to break up because there was a lot on his plate (Master's program and an out-of country job) and I didn't want him to feel like this relationship is an extra obligation, but he promised that he'd find a way to manage.  \n\nSkip a few months later and it seems there's really no way for him to prioritize our relationship. We were really only able to see each other in the evenings and there were multiple occasions where we would make plans and he would either be hours late or have to cancel last minute. I spoke with him about how this was a big problem for me because I felt like there was really no room for me in his life and I wasn't a priority, but he agreed to try harder to include me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce the summer came, he left the country again, this time for two months. This would have been fine expect it was during our summer break which is when I have ample time and was hoping to spend some of it with him (I'm a teacher so I'm actually quite busy as well).  The first month went ok,  but by the second month it felt like I was always initiating texts between us, and waiting hours for responses. I eventually became fed up and yelled at him about not feeling like I'm an important part of his life. This argument was really never solved. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummer Break is over, and he comes back to the country. I'm hoping to see him and talk things out, but he tells me that he needs space because he's stressed and is still upset with me and himself for the relationship problems and for yellingn at him. I say ok and we don't contact each other for a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reach out afterward to ask how he is and long he needs space. No response for two days. So I sent a message breaking up and saying I can't deal with the uncertainty of this relationship anymore. He responds and says it wasn't because he didn't want the relationship anymore, but because he needs to focus on himself and get through this rough patch in his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for the way I handled it? I feel like I should have stuck through the space and not broke up through text. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still care about him deeply.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I\u2019ve had a hard time figuring out exactly why, but know it\u2019s not in my head since I\u2019ve asked a couple others and they\u2019ve observed it too. He\u2019s around 60, so there\u2019s a considerable age gap.\n\nA couple of days ago we got into an argument. I stated: \u201cI\u2019m of course not criticizing person X for how he sees tattoos, it\u2019s a very personal thing, just glad he couldn\u2019t see all of mine since our beliefs differ\u201d, to which he replied \u201cNo no, I\u2019m criticizing YOU.\u201d\nOh okay.\n\nThe bickering back and forth, to sum it up, went something like this:\n\nAccording to him I\u2019m \u201cwalking around all the time provoking people, not considerate of how others can feel about my tattoos, should cover myself absolutely everywhere I ever go (when I brought up our very liberal European home country he stuck to his guns), should actually think about and respect people, not taking others into consideration at all, should always respect there can be ONE person that doesn\u2019t like it, clearly craved the attention because otherwise I would just cover them up, YOU ARE PROVOKING PEOPLE\u201d.\nMy points were: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen that invited over I\u2019m always considerate enough to try to cover myself (skirts down to my ankles &amp; shirts that show no cleavage), I haven\u2019t gotten any bad reactions here and several local people are tattooed as well as people from our home country constantly being here, I\u2019m not going to cover myself everywhere I go just because it might mess with one single persons beliefs never have never will, I can\u2019t consider every single persons opinion, you know I have severe anxiety I just have accepted this will draw people in and I generally avoid eye contact so I don\u2019t really notice the looks\u201d.\n\nI was as civil as possible considering I live with this guy even though I was fuming inside. Even though this was my life choice I don\u2019t feel I should have to take into consideration that another adult can\u2019t deal with other people being different than them in my day to day life, I felt it was extremely rude to suggest I do so. Another person cut the conversation off because they saw it was going south fast.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve noticed I have an ability to miss out on some social cues, so I\u2019m worried I might be the asshole in refusing to always consider other people\u2019s beliefs in public. So AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Guy tells heavily tattooed me I should always cover my body for the sake of all other people\u2019s beliefs, I outright refuse the idea.",

I refused.\n\nI want to start this off by acknowledging that this is petty. Accept it and move one.\n\nSo, when we were young, my brother sister and I shared a computer, with a desk and chair to use with it. Over time, the computer broke and us siblings bought our own laptops/computers/tablets/whatever, so the desk and chair went unused for just over a year. I have had the chair for 3 years in my room, and I constantly use it with my own desk.\n\nMy sister recently took the old desk into her room and wants to take the chair with it. I made an offer that she takes it today (the 17th) and on Saturday (the 19th) we go to a local thrift store and buy a new chair. I can't go buy a chair myself because I can't drive, my sister does. She isn't available to go buy one on my Saturday schedule, so I offered to give her the money and go get one herself. She refused because she isn't available at all during the store hours (I call bullshit but can't prove it). She will not go get a new chair on Saturday, so I told her that I wouldn't give her the chair in my room and she stormed off all upset. \n\nThere's two sides to this.\n\nI have had the chair for 3 years, the previous year it was unused by anyone. So within the last 4 years, I've been the only one to use the chair. My sister's only argument for why she should get the chair is that it's not mine, I replied by telling that it's not hers either. I made a fair offer to give her the chair for a few days until we get a new one. I don't want to wait till the next Saturday (the next day we're both able to go to the store) because she probably won't be able to go then either (just a hunch, but I am very busy on Saturdays, I could only go in the morning). I also fear that if I give an inch, she takes a mile, she says it'll be for a while, but if I give her the chair, I'll never see it again. She's not reliable on promises like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe chair isn't technically mine, I'm just the only one using it and the only one who needed it until now. She technically has 33% claim on the chair. The chair was bought originally to go with the desk that's now in her room. She might have better use of the chair (I use it for gaming mostly), so she might be doing something with the chair/desk that's important, like work or something.\n\nIt's not exactly mine, but it's not exactly mine, so who's in the right here? Who should get the chair?",

This summer (starting in May), I have planned to stay in the town our school is in because I enjoy independence and would rather not live at home.  I have been putting in a lot of effort searching for jobs for the Summer.  \n\nMy boyfriend has been indecisive to this point as to whether he wants to stay or not for valid reasons.  He has had some issues regarding his parents and is not necessarily happy living at home, but at the same time he enjoys his home and seeing his sisters, one of which is getting married this August.  \n\nThis indecisivity would not bother me normally, as   long distance in the summer is no issue for us; however, his lack of choice is now annoying me for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst of all, I have to sublet a place to live for the summer as my lease for my new house next year does not start until September.  As I am hard pressed for money, I am looking for cheap options.  If my boyfriend stayed, it would be most economical to share a room and split rent.  This could get us a nice appartment for cheaper rent.  That said, as he has still not made any indication of what he wants (and where I rent depends on of were living together or not) I have been unable to secure housing yet for the summer, which is a month away.\n\nSecond of all, and the more significant issue, my boyfriend and I have both been offered the same jobs at a local historic site as tour guides.  This is a very appealing offer to me as it is close to campus, interesting, and good hours.  The problem is, my boyfriend does not want to live together while working the same job (he believes it would be an unhealthy amount of time together, and I agree).  I am currently in the various stages of the interview process for three jobs, but would really like to accept this position as it is my ideal place to work.  It would also relieve me of the burden of continuing interviews for other jobs, which is extremely stressful in the midst of preparing for finals.  However, my boyfriend's indecisiveness is preventing me from doing so.\n\nLastly, I am just generally worried that if he is uncertain if he wants to stay for the Summer, he may eventually regret his decision and displace that frustration on me, which would be extremely unhealthy for our relationship.\n\nI've talked to him about this, and he still is understandably unsettled about what he wants to do, but he is putting in no effort when it comes to finding another job himself, and for some reason seems to assume that it one person were to look for a different job, it would be me.\n\nI feel as if I am putting in all the work in regards to planning for summer (a month away) and he is just making things more difficult for me.  It's making me extremely annoyed and honestly worried about living together if it were founded from conflict.  AITA?",

Then she asks if my friend could come over as well because I live with my sister and she had been trying to set my sister and my friend up for a couple weeks. At first I said no because I knew I would be tired from traveling and plus I was stressed because I had gotten behind on a lot of work and my friend was not a very relaxed person, he is more of a do all kinds of crazy shit kinda person, breaking things and me constantly having to stop him from doing something stupid.

Everyone immediately starts ragging on me about how I'm being boring and I'm usually not like this and how we have to do something exciting. I look to my girlfriend because I thought she would step in to help me but no, she starts saying the same things and saying that I'm being a buzzkill. I tried to defend myself to no avail. Then, when I tried to talk to my girl, she won't talk to me because I wasn't excited enough to see her. By this point I was pretty pissed and when I unpacked a 110 dollar rum I had bought in Ecuador, every one flocked to me asking for a drink. But as I said I was pretty mad so I said no, there is beer in the fridge. My girlfriend cried because I was being mean but I honestly just felt betrayed. \n\nWas I a bit extreame?

I don\u2019t want anyone close to actually know so that is why I am posting this here.\n\nBackstory: My friend and I have been like best friends ever since middle school and I have seen his house and the conditions he lives in.  He is not living in a bad condition, but (I don\u2019t feel comfortable saying this) lets say he is unfortunate (I don\u2019t want to go into detail).\n\nOk so this is where it starts:  \n\nThere are these sophomores on the bus where my friend and I used to ride (until he got kicked off). We are freshmen. They were always up to no good (from what I have seen), but never really did anything in sight of the driver. Anyways, so they bring a cigarette and/or vape one day and use it secretly. Me being traumatized by my parents over the years that drugs are bad for you, I tell my friend that we should probably move up front. He insists that it is ok and that I should not be a \u201cwuss.\u201d I accept it, and just try to ignore them. I notice when they are vaping/smoking that they keep in the smoke in and just leave it be. My friend keeps on being obvious at staring at them, and they offer to him to try to vape. I\u2019m thinking \u201che is obviously going to say no\u201d but was I wrong. He tries it, and I feel infuriated.  I move down one seat (the juniors were in front of us) and stay there and ignore them all. When we get to school,  I let everyone get off (including them without being obvious by pretending to get something out of my backpack). I make no eye contact with my friend and he just passes by. I don\u2019t know what else he did, but thats all I saw. Then, I talk to the bus driver to tell him what happened, and he asks for names. I tell him the names of the 3 juniors that were mainly involved, and with little hesitation, I tell him my friends name.\n\nFast forward to lunch the next day (he was not on the bus), I find out (by him telling me) that he has been kicked off the bus. He was called to the front office and they called his mom the day before. His mom is at work and no one can pick him up, and I start to feel really guilty. She is practically forced to come for her son while she is working. He is obviously really down when he tells me this (at lunch the next day) and the more I think about it, the more I feel guilty and hurt. I see him being brought to school by her mom while I know she should be at work since really early in the morning. She works really hard and it just hurts me the more I think about it. \n\nSorry if this makes little sense. I\u2019ll take any criticism.\nShould I have approached the situation differently? Like talked to him about it? He obviously needs the bus to get to school and home. BTW I don\u2019t know how he does not suspect me but I guess he believes I would never.\n",

Finally, two days before the day of the game, I sent the same message about four times, because if the game was going to happen, I needed to know. He proceeded to not answer, so I told him to quit the silence and at least say something, because he was being an asshole. He then proceeded to get very mad and quit the game as a whole. The rest of the party then also got mad at me for spamming him, and left the game to start a new one without me. AITA?",

We had to write a research paper about any particular topic relating to Western Civ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends and I were talking in discord as I was finishing up the essay. I asked my friends, \"Do any of you want to see my essay?\". My one friend, we'll call A, said yes. I assumed that A would simply look at my paper and maybe give some comments. I uploaded the file into discord for him to download. He downloads the file, copies all of my work except my name, and uploads it to pastebin. He said he did this so \"Now when your professor checks for plagiarism, this'll come up and she'll call you out for plagiarism\". This was very funny to him, but for a guy like me with awful anxiety, this is horrible. I asked him to take it down, but he said he couldn't. I quickly decided I had to upload my file to my professor's website, because I thought if I delayed any longer, it may seem like I stole it from pastebin and just slapped my name on it. I barely have any proof that I wrote it, except for one thing; A month prior to the due date, we had to hand in a thesis statement to my professor. I used the same thesis statement verbatim in my essay. I'm hoping that could hold as solid evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my father about this situation, and he is furious. He called A's parents and told them the situation. Now my friends, including A, are berating me for doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm confused on is this: Although he explicitly said that it's a \"good prank\", his defense is that he didn't mean to make it this bad of a situation. I believe him, I assume he would've deleted it if he had that option. I also eventually convinced him to email pastebin to ask for it to be removed. I believe that regardless, he still caused this situation and should be held accountable. I could get into serious trouble for plagiarism, and even be kicked out of my college. Was it wrong to allow my dad to inform his parents, and possibly get him in trouble?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome notes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I've known A and my other friends for years\n\n  \n\\*I probably shouldn't have trusted A. He always pulls these kinds of pranks without thinking on me and my other friends.\n\n  \n\\*I still do not know the outcome of my paper. I have not been contacted by my professor yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. Thank you.",

My GF is completely okay with this - we cleared it up before committing to a relationship. We have now been together for over 2 years and we've lived together for over a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recelty turned 26 and got a bag for toiletries from my GF's parents. They live far away so my GF bought it for me on their behalf. It was her idea to get it as she'd heard me complain that I didn't have one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she asks me if I'd started using the bag (she knew that I had, it was on my table and it was clearly the reason she asked). I said that I have, but I'd used it for my weed+equipment when I go biking. She wasn't happy about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to use it for weed when I don't need it for toiletries and then for toiletries when I need it for that. She doesn't want me to do that because she says it will stink (it wouldn't because the actual weed is in a vacuum-sealed container. Anyways...It's a toiletries bag - is anyone gonna go sniff it?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that a gift is something you give hoping it\u2019ll cause as much joy as possible. I also believe that the one who gives the gift has no right to decide how the gift is used. If you still claim the right to dictate how it's used, then you're still claiming ownership of the item - and \u201cthen you haven\u2019t given a gift to someone else but to yourself\u201d. My mom always preached this to me growing up, so this sits deeply within me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my point of view then my GF is trying to dictate how I use one of my personal belongings with arguments of how she spent so long finding a bag for TOILETRIES, and how the bag was FROM her parents for when we VISIT her parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got pissed with the situation and said \"Fine! I'll throw it back in here (closet) and only use it twice a year then\". That's probably where I should've left it.

Now it's just sitting empty in the closet for me to use a few times a year instead of being something that I use all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel as if I'm just being made out to be the dick for taking a stand about the use of my personal belonging, but it might\u2019ve been unnecessary.

I constantly want to give to everyone so they can be happy and also I just love gift giving. I don\u2019t really have to buy friendships, so it doesn\u2019t feel like that. It\u2019s more of like when I want to buy drinks for a friend or give a person I care about a small gift or just simple little things. Sometimes though, I tend to draw myself back because I feel like people notice this and want to take advantage of it.\n\nOne time in particular, a friend had came in from out of town and gotten his car towed. He expressed how he\u2019d be in so much debt and wouldn\u2019t be able to get it out so I offered to help find other solutions. The easiest and quickest solution was to bail his car out then and there, so I told him not to worry about it right away and just pay me back when he can. It\u2019s been almost 8 months and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna see that $300 ever again.\n\nAnother is more recently and slightly different, I\u2019ve let a friend stay at my house for about a half week since they\u2019ve been in a difficult situation. They also don\u2019t have a car so I had to drive them to work for a few days as well. I didn\u2019t mind this and they said they\u2019d pay me back in any way they can (buying me drinks or giving me cigs) which was totally okay with me. But when I asked for those things (for instance, just asking if they could buy me a drink when I see them out) they acted like I would owe THEM for it now.\n\nSo in conclusion, should I feel bad for asking for my money back? Should I feel like a dick because, even though I give a lot, people never want to return it? \n\nI know the simple answer here is stop being nice to people that don\u2019t deserve it. But sometimes it\u2019s more difficult than that. I just want to not feel like I owe people things after all that I\u2019ve given them.\n\nI hope some people can relate to this in some way, and thanks in advance to anyone reading ",

Mom is abusive and neglectful, Dad is borderline abusive and is neglectful. I'm an adult now and I don't live with them anymore, so the bad stuff all happened when I was living under their roof. Since this is about my dad, I won't go into detail with what my mom did. \n\nMy dad denies that my mom was ever abusive and gets mad at me for making her feel bad. I have PTSD from how she treated me, and I've told him this. He doesn't care, it seems. When I got an abscess (basically a cyst on steroids), he took me to the doctor once. They didn't know the problem. The pain was so intense that moving an inch made me scream bloody murder. He seemingly didn't care and forced me to go to school every day. The only reason he called a doctor again is because I collapsed in the hallway and the school nurse noticed. He also makes fun of everything I eat, despite my constant telling him to stop. His comments gave me an eating disorder that made my BMI drop to 15. He also made weird sexual jokes and comments around me, and wouldn't let me go when hugging me and kissing my cheek.\n\nSo one terrible day, he asks me what's wrong because I'm crying in the car. After fifteen minutes of me refusing to spill it, I finally break because I want someone to cry to. I ask him if he's ever noticed how I eat in secret, don't eat a lot, how I've been getting thinner, etc. He says no. Finally it clicks and he says, \"What, do you have an eating disorder or something?\" I scream, \"YES!\" \n\nHis response is denial because I'm gaining weight and yada, yada, yada. I snap and say something like, \"this is why I hate opening up to you! You always make it worse, just like when I tried to tell you about Mom!\"\n\nAgain, denial. This is where I might be the huge asshole. He's being as calm as possible while I'm screaming at him, telling him how much it hurts to not have your own father protect you from abuse, how it's like he's dead to me, how he and Mom made me want to die, how he probably doesn't care, all this stuff that would make any sane parent feel horrible about themselves. After I lose my voice, I sob into my hands and apologize for yelling. I ask him to promise me that he won't tell my mom about my eating disorder. For some reason, whenever I have a problem, my mom thinks it's an attack on her, and she goes crazy. Like, kicking open the door to the point where I think she's going to kill me crazy. It'd also give her a new thing to insult me about. He knows this.\n\n\"I can't promise that,\" says Dad.\n\nThere it is. I feel like he doesn't care about me at all. He's willing to throw me under the bus, risk my safety. I look at him and say, \"I will never tell you about my problems ever again.\" He says no, it'll get better, we can talk about it, it's just a bump in the road. I shake my head and reassure him that I will never open up to him, that he's lost his chance forever. I'm sticking to my word, no matter how much of a cunt that makes me. \n\nStill, I feel horrible of denying him deep conversations and opportunity to help me. I honestly don't think he's malicious like my mom, but he's just apathetic. I've spent years opening up and trying to beg him for help, and it's just blown up in my face every single time. This was the final straw. Am I the asshole for giving him such a heavy blow to his pride as a parent?",

We were living in Central America and just getting him to the first hospital for a diagnosis was a crazy trip (he was diagnosed there as having a massive heart attack) . Then he had to be transported through the Central American mountains to the other side of the country to a different hospital so he could be stabilized for 5 days so he can (hopefully) be safely transported to the US for heart surgery.\nI took him (it was against his will, I had to fight him) to the first hospital and followed him to the second hospital and stayed in a hostel for 4 days. I went back to where we were living to clean up and pack our luggage for the trip back to the US. I texted him when I got back saying I was so fucking exhausted I could barely stand up, could I please have one night to sleep. He texted me back saying I had to clean and pack and if I wasn\u2019t on the 9am flight to Panama City the next morning, I will be responsible for his death. So I stayed up and did what I had to do and was on the 9am flight.\nWhile we were on the plane I asked him where his daughter was picking us up at, Harrisburg or Philly? He said she\u2019s picking us up in Tampa and she\u2019s driving us to a resort in Orlando bcs that is where she is on vacation with his grandkids.\nI thought he was fucking joking. He told me his daughter is a nurse. No nurse would pick someone up in Tampa and drive them all the way to fucking Orlando knowing they were being stabilized after a massive heart attack (his left ventricle was completely blocked, it\u2019s called a Widow Maker). Well, that is exactly what she did. She had him singing karaoke, took him to the Golden Corral\u2026for 3 fucking dayssss. I won\u2019t get into the horrific craziness we had to go through getting him from Philly to central PA.\nWe make it to central PA at 4am on a Monday morning, I wake him up at 8am and ask him what he wants to do. Im completely lost at that point, I\u2019ve spent 4 days with a family that just didn\u2019t care about him. He says he wants to go to a clinic, I should\u2019ve demanded a hospital but I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know why. We go to the clinic and they book him an appointment for Wednesday, why I didn\u2019t walk up to that counter and demand an ambulance, I don\u2019t know why. \nWe get back to her house at 10:30 am, everyone is still sleeping, not one of those people got up to see if their Dad/Pappy went to a Dr/hospital/clinic, nothing, they left it to a perfect stranger to do.\nWhen she did get up and was informed about a Wednesday appt, it didn\u2019t bother her, remember, she is a nurse, I am not.\nWhat did bother her was her DISGUSTING neon green outdoor pool and her DISGUSTING backyard, so she walked her dad and I around her backyard pointing out all the crap that needs to be done bcs she\u2019s having a pool party on Friday. I thought she was fucking joking, she wasn\u2019t, she was serious about me and her dad getting her pool and yard clean.\nI went and laid on one of his granddaughter\u2019s beds and \u201cinternetted\u201d while he spent 2 days cleaning the pool and the yard. Wednesday rolls around, I get him back to the clinic and when they realized what his situation really was, there was an ambulance there in less than 10 minutes. He went into emergency heart surgery and 2 stents were placed in him.\nThey let him out the next day after informing us everything he was to do. So the next couple days I have him outside on little walks and car drives, but his phone won\u2019t stop blowing up. It\u2019s his daughter and she is PISSED we\u2019re not in the house. These people watch TV all day. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s nice out, they don\u2019t go out. So Im thinking maybe she thinks Im over exercising her dad?\nThird morning after heart surgery I wake up to banging. I walk down the hall and there he is in one of his granddaughter\u2019s bedrooms knocking down a wall. I\u2019ll never forget looking into that room and seeing his daughter\u2019s gigantic ass standing behind him with her hands on her hips while he\u2019s bent over and about to pick up 2, 20-30lb buckets of drywall and walk them down a narrow, one and a half story set of stairs, through the foyer, heave the buckets shoulder height into the bed of a truck and then go repeat it about 50xs!!! I pushed her giant ass aside, grabbed the fucking buckets and did it all myself. I didn\u2019t know those people, I shouldn\u2019t have to labor for them. I\u2019ve done practically everything in my power to keep her dad alive and she\u2019s doing her best to fucking kill him.\nWhen we finally left, I was so angry and they all knew it.\nA year and a half later he needs to go back for shoulder surgery, I go with him bcs I don\u2019t trust any of those people to take care of him properly. While I was there, things were better. His grandchildren weren\u2019t demanding sandwiches; \u201cPappy, make me a sandwich Im hungry\u201d. No please, no thank you, nothing and Im Canadian, this shit doesn\u2019t fly with me. I  told him that he needs to stop his granddaughters from talking to him like that, they need to use their manners, especially with their grandfather!!! He told me that wasn\u2019t his job, his job was to spoil them. That first visit I finally had enough and I confronted them, told them if they don\u2019t stop demanding things from him and if they want something they better use their manners or they\u2019ll be dealing with me, not him. So the girls were amazing the second visit/stay, please and thank you\u2019s every time, I was (and still am) very proud of them. I even started feeling better about his daughter.\nFlash forward 6 months and we\u2019re getting married (I\u2019m still hoping I did the right thing, ugh). The day before the wedding his daughter starts to apologize and then explain her outrageous and dangerous behaviors from the first visit. I stop her and tell her it\u2019s ok and gave her a hug. I did it only bcs it was the day before my wedding and there would\u2019ve been nothing she could\u2019ve said to make what she did better, in fact there was a huge chance she\u2019d just piss me off more and I didn\u2019t want to risk it.\nSo everything is going pretty great, we buy an RV and moved back to North America last spring. We agreed to help his daughter put in a second bathroom and clean and rebuild their nasty backyard. On our way there she sends us pics of the area they want the bathroom, they\u2019ve already knocked down the walls and starting the reno. We were so proud they were finally taking the initiative themselves. We get there and\u2026.she knocked down half her fucking house. She knew no one agreed to that, you could see it on her face when she led us through her house.We had plans, we had an important wedding to go to, we were supposed to go to Maine, what we agreed to would\u2019ve taken a month, at the most 6 weeks. He labored 6 days a week, 6-10hr days for 4 MONTHS. I didn\u2019t go, I didn\u2019t agree to any of that shit and I wasn\u2019t doing it. He couldn\u2019t let his grandchildren live in that and I understood.\nI made it clear to the children that I adore them (they know their mom is a pyscho, they\u2019ve made that very clear to me) and they know and believe it. But I will not speak to his daughter anymore, not casually, there needs to be a definitive reason why she needs to speak with me. I will also not go back to PA with him. They are all invited here, even her, our RV is huge with 2 bathrooms and it sleeps eight comfortably. But Im not going near her on her turf ever again.\nNow my husband and his daughter think I am an outrageous asshole, there is even talk of divorce (from him, not me).",

He can\u2019t walk right, he\u2019s slurring his speech, and giving more classical signs of a stroke. Also, my uncle is 60-years-old and has been morbidly obese for at least 30 of those years. Since he\u2019s been in the hospital, they still don\u2019t know what it is. Potentials are spinal tumor, multiple myeloma, or other bad neurological and/or cancerous things. \n\nNow, have never, ever, liked my uncle. I have never loved him. I know this makes me sound terrible, but it\u2019s true. \n\nMy uncle has always been the kind of person to intentially piss the people around him off. He drives unnecessarily aggressively, has cursed almost every member of my family out (including 10yo me when I was crying because I was scared during a tornado), has always intentionally messed up his \u201cmemories\u201d of people/things/teams that others like just to make it look like he doesn\u2019t give a shit (which, he doesn\u2019t), and more. He never tips wait staff, because \u201cit\u2019s their job.\u201d He has ZERO personal hygiene, and spends literally all of his non-work days parked in front of the TV watching \u201cpolitics\u201d (read: inflammatory \u201cfacts\u201d about our country\u2019s \u201cdemise\u201d). He has always owned dogs that he neglects so much that I have genuinely considered calling the ASPCA to finally give him reperrecusions for his actions. (And before I get hit with it, I am a LVT in a veterinary ER. I know true neglect and abuse when I see it, unlike most Facebook commenters.) He\u2019s extremely sexist, racist, violently atheist, and just a generally gross person. I have seen my uncle physically gripe waitresses, he has told me that I need a husband because single women \u201ceventually become welfare cases\u201d, and told my mom that she should disown me when I was dating a Mexican guy. My mom says he loves me. I don\u2019t believe it. He has only ever tried to buy my love. He\u2019ll buy me tickets to sports games, amusement parks, and more. After YEARS of him intentionally antagonizing me, buying me shit I don\u2019t even necessarily want, and not making any ACTUAL effort to get to know me, I\u2019m tired of him. If it was up to me, he wouldn\u2019t be part of my life. The way he treats himself, his dogs, and the people around him literally sickens me. This past Thanksgiving, I could barely even look at him. \n\nSo now, he\u2019s potentially dying, and my mom and grandma are stressed. Yeah, they pretty much hate him too, but he\u2019s still their son/brother. To me? He\u2019s nothing. I am not the kind of person to wish ill on others, especially when it comes to health problems, but I feel like karma is finally catching up to him. My mom asked me to visit him with her the other day, and I said no. She understands but still says he loves me and would like to see me. Would I be an asshole for not going to see him? \n\nTLDR; my obese asshole uncle is having severe health problems but after years of suffering through his personality, I don\u2019t care what happens and I don\u2019t want to see him.",

I grew up loving my brother we spent countless hours playing D&amp;D and video games together.  When i was about 10 him 12 he got caught masturbating into my step-mothers underwear.  My father was furious so he got some licks but nothing very brutal.  Because of this my parents agreed to have us both have visit with a Psychiatrist.  I didn't understand any of it at the time i grew up with a fair share of medical issues so i was in and out of the hospital so i just went with the flow.  Kyle had a temper when we fought often over small petty things like video game deaths bad rolls he would get very physical so it often came to blows but we would resolve it our self's . About a year after the first incident with my step-mother underwear he got caught doing it again.  Once again he got some licks but this time my father kicked him out of the  house and had him live with our grandmother.  Because of my parents jobs i too went to live with my grandmother about a year later.   once we started high school he started dating a girl online and in doing so basically stopped doing anything with me at all.  I stayed pretty quiet  about it but it upset me a lot, so one time at our mother's  we got into a little argument and i called him some names that i really can't remember and brought up how is girlfriend is making him a shitty person,  he tackled me to the ground and held a screwdriver to my neck, my step  father and step-brother pulled him off of me,  from the look in his eyes to this day i think if they didn't pull him off he would have killed me.  we moved back into our father's when i was 15 him 17 both of us riding motorcycles to high school that my father had gotten for us.  I was still trying to have a relation ship with him i tried playing cards(MTG)  more D&amp;D, battle tech, but he was glued to his phone with his girlfriend.  So we lost any sort of a relationship.  During our high school time he was caught humping my pillow and it was the last straw for my father and me. He was kicked out of the house my father offered him the motorcycle title and keys before he left but he refused and told us to fuck off. About a week after his departure i was organizing my room, we shared a room, and found an unfamiliar journal. I noticed after the first page  it had a date and he was describing how his day went.  I flipped to the middle and found something really disturbing.  He was talking about his sexual fantasy's.  He wanted to tie his girlfriend to the bed and rape here, I'm paraphrasing it was very very detailed.  I showed this to my parents and they were equally disturbed.  I decided i was done with Kyle he made no attempt to respond to my text or spend any time after  school with me, the only thing he cared about was that girl.  My mother kept a relationship with him for a while until they fell off when he thought that she had given my grandparents his phone number when it was actually me, and i had told him this, but he didn't care.  He's dropped  all contact with anyone in his family.  I'm 24 now and the other day on the phone my mother brought up how she wanted to see him again and talk  and say she's sorry, to which i just responded uh huh, yeah i hear you.  Then she asked how i felt.  I told he i don't care about him.  To me he's gone from my life and that was his choice as much as mine  i made my efforts i forgave many of his wrongdoings but he wouldn't make any attempts for anyone but his girlfriend My mother was pretty taken about by this and asked me if i even cared about him to which i said no i despise him. She just resigned to that and said  that despite what he's done she'd forgive him and wants him back in his life, and i just said good luck with that, don't tell him where i live. \n\nAm i the ass hole here? i understand she's a mother and has a connection and she doesn't want to hear her son talk like that but i just want nothing to do with him and never want to speak with him.",

My dad's on the spectrum and he often pisses people off like it's his job.\n\nHis relationship with his sister has degraded severely over the last couple of years to the point to where they're not talking any more. I find this to be a pity, but up until now they've both been in very good health, so I thought they'd eventually reconcile after some time apart. My aunt takes slights very seriously and when she decides to be furious with someone it's almost like they're dead to her. My aunt is extremely generous and kind as long as the people in her life actively appreciate the impact that she's made in theirs.\n\nYesterday I received a message from my mom (divorced from my dad) that my aunt has meningitis and is in the hospital. Also, my cousin has had to drop everything and flew a couple of states over to stay with her in the hospital. I was told explicitly not to tell my father, in all caps. I called my cousin this morning and talked to her about the severity of the situation, my aunt is falling in and out of consciousness and can't deal with a lot of stimulation at the moment, so no one can talk with her except my cousin and my Aunt's BF. When going through everything my aunt said things like, \"don't tell \"my dad\", don't even tell him if I'm dead\". My cousin tried to talk her down from that, but she was having none of that. She's basically staking this out as a final wish kind of demand and the family is taking the request with the utmost seriousness.\n\nI told my cousin that it would be extraordinarily sad if my dad was never given the option to reconcile with his little sister while she was dying. She cried, I cried, and then I told her I wouldn't tell him out of respect for my aunt.\n\nSo I spent the day struggling deeply with this knowledge. Eventually, after thinking through what kind of incredible betrayal of my father it would be for everyone else in the family to know about this except for him, and what kind of weight it would be for him to bare if she was to pass away without him even trying to reconnect, I called him. I asked him if there was anything big or new with him, and he replied like everything was great. Then told him that there may be something really big going on, I told him I couldn't give him specifics as to the who or what, but he's smart so he got enough information from me to follow a bread crumb trail that I know exists. I've already had confirmation that he's digging into it.\n\nEven if she won't take his call or my cousin won't let any notification get through to her, my dad at least deserves the opportunity to make up for past mistakes, and at the very least know in his heart his last action towards her wasn't tinted with acrimony. I believe my aunt deserves the same.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for basically defying my Aunt's dying wish?",

Needless to say, she isn't big on doctors.\n\nThe doctors out here aren't big on me either. I've pointed out every time we go to her GP that blood pressure has to be taken after 10 min of sitting down with feet flat on the floor (and not needing to go pee, not having eaten in the last 1/2 hr, and so on). Every time we go in they assure me that they take it twice and take the average. I point out that when one number is WAY OFF the average will also be off. They get mad, I get mad, Grandma gets mad. Rinse and repeat. At home **and** after 10 min of rest at the doctor's office her BP is consistently 120/60. Two weeks ago they called and said that 4 months ago (I was away and asked my uncle to take my Grandma to the doctor) they asked that Grandma come in twice a month for BP monitoring, my uncle wasn't in the room and my Grandma \"forgot\". I'm on her HIPA and make all her appts so I made an appt for later that week and not an hour later we got a callback, the office refused to talk to me. Grandma still refuses to wear her hearing aids and just said \"yes\" and asked me to call back to figure out what it was about. I called back, found out that the doctor doesn't want me at ANY of her appts, and pointed out that every single appt that she has gone to the last 2 years has been made by me, and pointed out that before me my Grandma was notorious for canceling or not showing up to any doctor appts. They agree, but her doctor doesn't like me. I pointed out that because I was on her HIPA that it is my right. Again, they agree, but her doctor thinks I'm bossy.\n\nThe doctor thinks I'm bossy not just because of the BP, but also the Meniere's disease. I told her about the ENT's diagnoses, and that my Grandma HAS TO wear her hearing aid and glasses. Her GP said, \"your granddaughter is just being controlling, don't listen to her\". 2 months later Grandma fell and the EMT's agreed that is was the Meniere's disease. I called her GP and explained that she fell for the 4th time that year and she owes me an apology and should update her records to include the ENT diagnoses. I did later have the ENT fax over her records to her GP, but the office really should have done that already. I filed a complaint that time but when my Grandma found out SHE was PISSED and said I had no right.\n\nAITA for filing another complaint against her doctor despite how Grandma feels?",

As always, this isn\u2019t as cut and dry as the title suggests. Keep in mind I\u2019m highly emotional right now so this may seem ranty and grammatically incorrect. \n\n   I\u2019m a very anxious person. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I had one friend who I would hang out after school with. I\u2019ve known from the beginning we were a toxic combo but I always figured I\u2019m too smart to get truly entangled with someone who was abusive. Our relationship was entirely platonic because I wasn\u2019t interested in him in that way but he was obsessed with me. I have countless letters explaining not only how much I meant to him but destructive behaviors he would do because I was so sick that I couldn\u2019t be with him. (I told him I didn\u2019t want a relationship because I was in a horrible mental space which was entirely true but it wasn\u2019t the whole story). He was so obsessed with me he told me he had a couple of possessions of mine like socks he kept. I can\u2019t be more specific because of the .00000009 chance he finds this he will know it\u2019s him. \n\n     Summer came and went and he got a girlfriend which was amazing for me because we could just be friends. We started hanging out a lot more which was conflicting for me because (this is pathetic I\u2019m well aware) i loved the feeling of hanging out with a person. It makes me feel like such a normal teenager which rarely happens. \n\n     The flip side is the actual experience. Every time I\u2019m hurt both physically and emotionally but you can\u2019t place the blame on him. He enjoys watching others in pain so his favorite was choking me but I\u2019ve had bruises from biting and I\u2019ve been spit on and pinched and slapped across the face. I never told him I didn\u2019t want it but I never said anything remotely close to I did. He also talks a lot about his hardships which granted he has a very rough life. I\u2019ve been pushing therapy for years and offer other suggestions but he never tries a single thing aside from heavy drinking and drugs to cope. But none of this mattered because I had a friend! A worthless, mentally ill, untalented sack of nothing had someone who enjoyed my company!!! I was so lucky. Even now I slightly crave that. \n\n   Here\u2019s where the break started. I confessed that I was bisexual a couple months ago which is huge for me because I come from an extremely religious upbringing which has damaged me in more ways than I think I fully understand. I told him that I honestly feel a little ashamed because of not only my environment but also because Ive seen it viewed outside of the LGBT+ community as just a fetish. He told me he would always support me and I felt like I was on cloud nine. Then it became a running gag that I was gonna steal his girlfriend. Don\u2019t know exactly where that started but it just became a thing. \n\n     Then New Year\u2019s Day I get a text  from a number I don\u2019t have saved. It\u2019s his girlfriend who send a vagina picture saying my friend said I wanted to see it. It was all a joke. It was just meant to make me laugh. But I wasn\u2019t laughing. I was crying. I am so genuinely sorry if you were genuinely violated but this made me feel kind of that way. Also I\u2019m still a minor for a couple of months so is that illegal I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t care too much about that. I don\u2019t know if it was just \u00ab\u00a0new year, new me\u00a0\u00bb energy but I just blocked them on everything and when I saw him in school I didn\u2019t talk to him at all. \n\nI know this may not be the right place to post this but I genuinely can\u2019t think and my dads in the hospital so I can\u2019t ask anyone else cause I want everyone to focus on his wellbeing but I desperately need some answers. Am I the asshole? Should I tell him why I gave him the cold shoulder? Is it better to be alone than to be in bad company? What can I do from here. Thanks to the one person who will read this lmaooo.

He\u2019d spend way more time with this girl than with his guy friends, even though they weren\u2019t even dating. She sibling-zoned him (essentially a friend zone but treating him like part of the family, \u201cyou\u2019re like a brother to me\u201d kind of thing) super hard but he wanted a relationship. He put up with being on the hook for a long time and would even regularly ask us for advice of what he should do. We all told him to end it and get over her because she was treating him like shit. Fred didn\u2019t take our advice (a trend with him). Anyway, summer break of junior year happened. We come back after break and she has a boyfriend, even though she explicitly told Fred that she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. Still, Fred continued to hang out Wilma despite that and our advice. \n\nWhen prom rolled around, Wilma took her boyfriend and Fred took Wilma\u2019s little sister (kinda weird). My friends and I never saw him that night even though the rest of us were hanging out with each other and our dates. But he wasn\u2019t part of our group. For our senior trip, Fred was always with Wilma and, again, never hung out with us. A whole week-long trip and we never really saw or hung out with him. That was the norm anytime they could be together, but he eventually stopped talking to her and they went to different colleges. Cool beans.\n\nFast forward 4 years and they start talking again. This was \\~8 months ago. I think she contacted him and they hit it off. She was finally ready for a relationship and he hadn\u2019t ever really gotten over her, I don\u2019t think. So they start dating right before college graduation and that\u2019s great. Good for them. But over the last 7-8 months that they\u2019ve been dating, my other close friend and I have only seen Fred like 8 times (all of us live no more than 15 minutes apart from each other), and most of those times are for scheduled events, like weddings or parties that mutual friends have thrown. Even though we try to do stuff with him (he always declines), he never makes an effort to hang out with us. Or if he does, he never follows through with his own plans. We\u2019re kind of pissed off now, because one of our best friends for the past 7 years is hardly a friend anymore, and we\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s indirectly Wilma's fault. Wilma is cool with us, so I don't think she's actively discouraging him from hanging out with us, but she's the main reason he's not.\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s popping the question tomorrow and I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s going to say yes. He\u2019s asked me twice now if I want to be in his wedding, and I\u2019ve just said, \u201cUhh, maybe. I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet.\u201d He\u2019s fully aware that we\u2019re not the biggest fans of Wilma and that we think that them dating for 8 months isn\u2019t enough. He\u2019s still proposing. My friend and I have had siblings do very similar things that ended up in separations/divorces so we're worried about him, but Fred doesn\u2019t like taking our advice or even entertaining it. \n\nSorry for such a long post, but AITA for not really wanting to be in my friend\u2019s wedding given all that?\n\nTL;DR Best friend got friendzoned by a girl in highschool. 4 years later they start dating. My friends and I never see best friend and we don\u2019t really care for the girl. After 8 months of dating, he\u2019s proposing and has already asked me twice if I\u2019ll be a groomsman. I\u2019ve said \u201cidk, maybe,\u201d hinting to him that I don\u2019t really want to be in his wedding. AITA?",

This didn't use to be an issue when we both worked seconds, however, he switched to first- waking up at 4:30, when I used to ideally go to bed. I have always been a night owl, sleeping at night always leaves me feeling tired no matter how much I sleep, AND lethargic ALL day until night time. I got up early everyday for 3 months. I have tried to exhaust myself with 2 hours of sleep so I can fall asleep with him. But no matter how tired I am, once darkness hits I just feel very \"up\" all of a sudden. I have tried for months now, but it just isn't working.\n\nHe tells me that if he feels me not beside him, it causes him to have nightmares of me cheating on him, which he wakes up mad at me for. Side note: No, I've never even so much as gave him reason to think I'd cheat. He freaks out on me if I have to get up for the bathroom, or if I get up for water. I can't even go to the bathroom now for more than 15 minutes with out him pounding on the door harassing me angrily about \"Really?! Why is it impossible for you to just stay in bed!!\". (I am **extremely** quiet as I hate dealing with this bs and he is still snoring after I've gotten up). I HATE just laying in bed bored for 6 hours, but he has a fit when I tell him I want to be able to stay up. He tells me I'm not trying hard enough to get on the same sleep schedule and am just being selfish. I think this is a ridiculous thing to get screamed at for, and genuinely feel suffocated that I can't do anything at night without reprimand. So, AITA?\n\nFinal side note: I have asked my doctor about my sleep patterns. He told me that it is probably a genetic factor, as I can fall asleep and feel rested within reason- my sleep rhythm just doesn't work on the same schedule as others.",

I had just gotten out of a very serious relationship of 5 years and honestly just wanted his company. We kept our relationship very secret and no one we worked with knew. After a year of dating he started wanting more and I was honest and told him that I didn\u2019t want to settle down and that it would be better if we weren\u2019t anything more than friends.

            "input": "This is going to be a crazy post and will make some of you a little confused so bear with me. I have a serious conundrum with my marriage and wife that I need help with. \n\nTo start, I am unable to have children. An accident when I was a kid basically sterilized me and I cannot have babies of any type. My wife and I have been married for 5 years, together over 10 and she was more devastated then I was to hear that I could not have children. She has been dreaming of having a baby since High School (We are childhood sweethearts). I had said earlier on in our relationship that I wasn't comfortable with surrogacy, so the idea of her being pregnant went up in smoke when we found out I was infertile. \n\nWell, after discussion, we decided to try IVF with a sperm donor for my wife. I was very uncomfortable with this when I was younger, but after realizing I was possibly ruining my wife's dream of being pregnant, I decided that I was being completely selfish. We saved up and did the IVF treatment and we were incredibly excited. However, after all the work and money, the treatments did not take and my wife did not end up pregnant. She was completely devastated, and honestly this caused a really huge depression for her. \n\nWe had no money left for IVF and she was completely distraught. So, after much discussion, and admittedly some alcohol, we came to the idea of finding our own sperm donor. We settled on someone we both knew that would be okay with it and discussed with him the basic idea of what he would be doing, etc. Sex would not be involved in anyway of course, and it would be completely \"medical\". We knew his physical background, genetic information, genealogical, etc., and he looks similar to me to boot. \n\nNow, during this time, the donor (Who I will call John) had expressed the idea of him being an \"uncle\" to the unborn child. My wife was okay with it, and we agreed that he could be in the child's life if he wanted to be. We have all of this in text form and written as well by the way. Furthermore, we made a deal of no child support of course (My wife and I would never do this anyway). \n\nMy wife got pregnant after the \"procedure\" (And yes, I know how redneck this sounds) and we were elated. Overjoyed. John was happy for us as well. The last few months have been amazing for my wife, and she has never been happier. We announced on FB a few days ago, and she was beaming all day. I am absolutely excited myself, as I didnt think I would ever get to be a father myself. However, some problems have arisen that we were not expecting. \n\nSince the \"procedure\", John has gotten into some trouble with the law. At first, it was nothing serious and I didn't think anything of it. Since then, John has progressively gotten into more and more trouble. He has lost his car, his job and more due to drug offenses (Marijuana. He worked in a hospital prior to this). Because of the arrest and resulting loss of his job, he lost his car due to not paying the bill and he was eventually arrested again after getting too drunk at a bar and causing a fight. His life is quickly spiraling out of control. \n\nJohn has messaged my wife on Facebook these things and she wants to invite him to live with us until he can get back on his feet. I am completely and absolutely against this idea in every way, shape and form.

So last night my flatmate K (20s F) had her good friend C (20s F) for drinks, since it had previously been C's birthday. I (20s M) ended up drinking with them, and we all ended up getting quite drunk, and walking to the nearby Maccas for some drunk food. C was gonna walk home at this point, be K and I offered her Ks room for the night, as she was going to go to her boyfriends. C agreed, and we walked K to her boyfriends flat, and then C and I headed back to mine. \n\nWhen we got home, C felt sick from all the drinking, so I stayed up talking to her for awhile. As I did I realized that I was finding her more and more attractive, and we ended up cuddling on K's bed. I offered for us to move to my room, as I didn't wanna be an asshole, and sleep and possibly to sexual stuff in my flatmate's bed, especially when my room was just down the hallway. C declined, and so I made ready to go to my room and sleep. As I started to get up, I decided to give kissing her a shot, and I did and she kissed me back, and we ended up making out for a bit. After I reoffered for us to move to my room she pushed me off saying she was too drunk to do anything else. So we stopped, and sat there and talked for a little longer, I gave her a few more kisses, and then I went off to my own room. When I got there I had a mild panic, and my drunk ass didn't know if I'd just enjoyed an awkward make out session, or had been super creepy, so my hungover self puts it to you Reddit, am I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR- Got drunk with my flatmate and her friend, offered to look after my flatmates friend, and ended up making out with her on my flatmates bed.",

            "input": "So i got into an argument with my dm and parts of my dnd group regarding the handling of my character. I\u2019m playing a charismatic fighter who\u2019s goal is to reform his old vigilante/mercenary group (basically the Minutemen from fallout 4) this requires me to go about recruiting willing people to join my cause, be they mercenaries,beggars, etc etc. This campaign has been planned for about 6 months and I remember deciding in passive aggressive anger over something I\u2019ve forgotten that instead of working up to making the \u201cnot\u201d Minutemen I would start with the company already formed with about 120 troops. The dm offered no push back at all on this. \n\nThe session started and we were being hired by the king to go find the queen who had been taken by the generic baddies. He was also sending his son to accompany us and to serve as our blank cheek (meaning we wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything at all during our campaign) I informed the king that he would have to also pay for my mercenary company\u2019s maintenance costs. Seeing as I had point tons of points into charisma I expected me to be told to make a charisma roll. No such luck. Instead I ended up in an hour long in character discussion with the king about paying for my company. No roles, just arguing. Eventually the king agreed to pay for my company seeing as I planned to use them during the adventure. With that concluded, we set off to the market and tavern to both give orders to my company and also purchase anything we needed before setting off. It was at this point that I asked the prince to buy me plate armor from the local store, which the warforged shop owner cheerful gave to me for free. At Lvl 1. We then proceeded to the tavern to give orders to the company to set up camp elsewhere in the kingdom and wait for further instructions as well as breaking off 10 men to accompany us to the next town for auxiliary work (not participate in combat) as well as to give another player who couldn\u2019t make it to the session a reason to be with the party since he was one of my mercenaries. We set off to the next town, when on the way there we discovered some traps on the road, the dm then said that we disarmed them, no roll, or even who disarmed them, just that we disarmed them with no input from any players. We were then ambushed by ravens and a tree person (I think a dryad). After that was sorted we went to the next town and ended the session there. \n\nOver the next few days the topic of my character came up in the group chat and we were told we would be voting as a party what would happen to my character, explicitly being told that of our group consisting of seven, six would have to agree to banning my character. after a lengthy discussion where I was told that I was ruining the game due to my mercenary company being disruptive to the game flow, me and two other party members argued that the only time they came up in a way that effected the party was in the hour long discussion that was only due to me not being told to roll charisma.  The dm then proceeded to tell me that I had to make a new character because my current one was so disruptive to the game. Every time me and the other two party members pointed out why it was bullshit (the two party members backstories relied on my character existing, me having less effect on the game then other players) we were told by another player that what the dm says is final and we should stop arguing. It was at this point that me and the other two considered leaving since i was being told to drop a character I had invested a bit of work into and that we essentially had no say in what happened despite being told we would. After some more discussion I said that I was perfectly happy to go to my original idea of trying to reform the company instead of already starting with it (as was my original intent) this was followed by another hour of arguing about how I couldn\u2019t recruit people to join us because the dm didn\u2019t want to deal with an entire new party, thus defeating the purpose of my character. We did eventually come to the conclusion to restart the game and allow me to recruit characters to assist our party. \n\nRight now however I\u2019m not sure if my actions were appropriate, the two other party members seem to this so but I\u2019m not sure myself. I acknowledge that starting with the mercenary company was a bad idea done in spite which is why I was so willing to reverse it, but I don\u2019t know about the dm\u2019s response of flat out banning my charismatic fighter. I\u2019m curious to hear others thoughts on this.",

Lived next door to them for 5 years now. never had any major issues minus when we first moved in and they had 10+ dogs barking in their backyard (they have a dog boarding business, not permitted) and I snapped and told them to get it under control since the permits in our county dont allow this. We havent ever reported them, but to be be fair they did control them and only do 5-6 dogs at a time now...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so fast forward to now. It was rainy and windy last night. Their tree on their front lawn uprooted and fell and is now leaning against our house and roof. Only minor damage to the gutter - nothing my husband cant fix. Well after much discussion with insurance etc it has come to my attention that if a tree falls it is the responsibility of the person who had DAMAGE to fix. So I could file a claim with my insurance company to remove the tree and fix our gutter. I wont be doing that since its not much damage and the tree company says its not worth it. But AITA for expecting THEM to have been the ones to call a tree company and at least OFFER to split the cost? Im livid that they arent seeming to do the neighborly thing. If it was the other way around I would IMMEDIATELY be on the phone trying to get someone to come out and cut down my tree that fell. They have made zero attempts and keep citing the insurance laws and rules. Ok, so since youre so \"by the book now\" should I ask you for your fucking dog boarding permits?

            "input": "Hello,\n\nThis past year I moved to Hawaii for work. I\u2019m in a one bedroom apartment. I\u2019d like people to come visit me, and when I speak to my friends around the country I always encourage them to take a trip here and hang out in paradise.\n\nA couple of months ago I wished happy birthday to a guy I dated in college for a couple weeks (I\u2019m a guy). He mentioned he loved seeing my pictures and was very attracted to the men I hang out with. Both he and I aren\u2019t typical \u201cprizes\u201d we both sort of struggle in the scene. I mentioned that if he wanted to come out meet some of these guys and be gay in Hawaii, he was more than welcome. I also mentioned off hand he should try and recruit some of our mutual close friends (small college) to come with him.\n\nRecently he calls me up and we start talking dates and activities and logistics. He\u2019s gonna come alone. We decide not to set any dates and not to book anything until our schedules for this coming summer start to take shape. Nothing is planned or booked. At the end of the call, he goes \u201cthere\u2019s one thing, I want to talk about what happened between us before I come. I feel like we never got the chance. And it bothers me a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the history: things didn\u2019t end well between us in college. I was a first semester freshman. He was a sophomore. He pursued me, and I never really felt anything for him. But he was nice and smart, so I continued for a few weeks hoping that maybe something would spark on my side. However, I eventually realized that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Before I said anything to him about that, I agree to go to the Winter formal with him. That night, I got really drunk\u2014 I think partly so I wouldn\u2019t be cold to my date. He was not drunk. The night ended with us in my dorm and me losing my virginity. \n\nAs it happened, in physical motion, I had this terrible moment of knowing I didn\u2019t want it to happen and regretting it was happening with this person. I ended the sex in tears curled up in a ball. He tried to comfort me and I played it off and wished him a good night. I stopped seeing him and slowly stopped replying to his messages after that night. UNTIL he asks to talk. \n\nI meet with him, and he doesn\u2019t address the night we hooked up. Instead, he goes on about how he was disappointed that I ghosted him after we had gotten \u201cso close.\u201d He sort of goes at it as though I was just a heartless fuckboy who broke his heart. He also made the key comment that \u201cbut it\u2019s okay that (I\u2019m) not ready for a relationship\u201d in a very condescending tone. I drew the line there and basically unleashed my side of the story: that i welcomed his advances cuz he was a nice guy but i ultimately never felt anything for him. We didn\u2019t speak for seven years after that until we reconnected when he moved to my city and connected with our mutual friends again.\n\nFast forward to today, and I know that I should give him a call and let him talk about what happened 7 years ago and lock in his trip to visit in Hawaii. But I\u2019ve been hesitating. I\u2019m shocked that he still is hurt by what happened so long ago, but I\u2019m also torn about telling him the full truth: that I felt he took advantage of me in my drunken, virginal state\u2014 him being older and much more experienced in sex and the dating scene. I don\u2019t want to go so far as to call it an assault\u2014 I think it\u2019s more in the grey area of consent. \n\nBecause it\u2019s so grey, I don\u2019t want to bring it up to him and force him to be accused of something so serious. However, I also don\u2019t want to take a phone call and listen to another condescending narrative in which I broke his heart (this is the story that he tells people to this day).\n\nThe adult in me knows I should suck it up and talk it out and softly tell the truth of why ghosted him 7 years ago, but I always just want to leave the past behind and not dig up the lousy way I lost my virginity.

            "input": "(Sorry for the probably confusing title, I can't think of one that sums up my situation very well)\n\nThis is my first AITA post so please, don't hold back any judgement. Okay so, I'm a junior in high school and this year, a girl has sort of latched onto my friend group. None of us were really friends with her before because most interactions with her go poorly. She tends to be obnoxious and loud and gets offended very easily at thing that aren't intended to offend, despite commonly offending others and saying she is joking. Because of this, Girl does not have many (if any) close friends and is generally disliked in our class. So far this year there have been many problems in my friend group with Girl. Girl has lied about many things, made assumptions and actions that have hurt people, and gotten very upset at not being included in our friend group activities. We feel bad leaving her out but we know (based on past experiences) that inviting her would most likely result in a less enjoyable time. I know that she is probably longing to be part of a group and so her actions may reflect this but things don't seem to be getting better with time. \n\nNow onto my main dilemma with Girl. Personally I believe in trying to be a nice and civil person so I have never openly expressed my dislike of Girl to her and have always tried to include her a little bit, but I have definitely avoided becoming friends with her and avoid her in general. A few weeks ago it was Girl's birthday and I saw her in the morning because we are both part of student council and were required to clean up from the dance that had taken place the night before. I wished Girl a happy birthday and went home. A few hours later she texted me and said \"Put me on your \\[Snapchat\\] story for my birthday\"  This was the exact text, no \"please\" or \"hey would you mind\", or general politeness. Just a direct command and then some photos she wanted me to post. I was very angered this but since it was her birthday and I knew she probably just wanted to feel included I didn't want to say no. I felt that it was rude of her to demand, not even ask, that I post of a photo of her. We are not close friends by any means, we very rarely talk, she has been rude to me and good friends of mine, and I generally reserve social media posts for more important occasions in my life. So I stuck a quick \"Happy Birthday!\" on the photo and put it on my story, but went through the trouble to make it so that only Girl would see my story (the number of views would be anonymous so she would not know that no one else saw it). I didn't want people thinking that her and I were good friends, and I felt that she was using me to try and get attention on her birthday. I don't like being told what to do and I don't want to be associated with her. Eventually I felt like a jerk because she probably didn't get birthday wishes from people in our grade and no one else was going to post about her, so I allowed everyone to view the post. She didn't say thank you and eventually the story disappeared after 24 hours.\n\nWas I an asshole for going through all that trouble just so people wouldn't think we were friends? Is it worse to be honest and tell her that I can't stand her or is it worse to act like I like her when I actually despise her?\n\nLet me know if there are more details I need to include or if I was an asshole plain and simple.

My brother, who I get on with very well, is also working, but in a professional and what I think most people would describe as a 'grown-up' job.\n\nWe live in the suburbs of the capital city. A few years ago I decided to move out of the family home to live in the city with friends. This was a very big deal at the time as in our culture children usually stay in the family home till they are married (and sometimes even after marriage). My relationship with my parents was extremely fraught at the time, but it has now recovered and gone back to mostly the way it was. I come home pretty much every weekend and see them all the time, I just like the independence of living on my own. My parents still hate that I don't live with them and implore me to move back all the time, which I feel some guilt about. I was planning on moving back home later this year to save up some money for a down-payment and mortgage for a house.\n\nMy brother on the other hand, after graduation, got a job in another city where the rent is about half of what I pay on average. Obviously, he has managed to save much more money than me, even though he hasn't been working as long as me. I make a decent amount of money for what I do but I have much higher outgoings, and I also am much more spendthrift than my brother - I like to spend money on holidays, clothes, going out etc.\n\nThis all came to a head a few days ago when I overheard my parents talking to my brother about helping him with a down-payment on a house in the capital as an investment. They went quiet when I walked into the room and when I questioned them about it, they very pointedly asked me how much I had in savings, how much I earned and how much I paid in rent every month. They then asked my brother how much he had in savings. The subtext was that I had been extremely foolish with money and that I should be embarrassed that my younger brother had more in savings than his older sister. I found it really humiliating to be put on the spot and tell them exactly how much money I had.\n\nI don't really have an issue with parents lecturing their children about their finances, that is a normal thing for parents to do. What I did find hurtful was that my parents had obviously decided to reward my brother with a house because he had more money than I did. Now, I don't expect anything from my parents - I've never ever expected them to help me with a down-payment on anything. I just found it really hostile that they were basically punishing me for moving out - my dad made me calculate how much money I've 'wasted' on rent in the city out loud. That's fine, but it was my choice to spend that money. They laughed out loud when I told them how much I had in savings.\n\nA few months ago I had a vague conversation with my dad about how it might be a good idea to buy a house with my brother, possibly with some help from my dad. Their thinking has obviously now changed and they would rather come to an arrangement with my brother.\n\nFor context - my brother moved to another city because that's where he got a job, so he didn't have much 'choice' about moving out. This is opposed to me, who 'chose' to leave the house when I didn't really need to. I also want to say that my brother found the whole thing uncomfortable and felt a bit sorry for me.\n\nAITA/oversenstive brat for being hurt about this? Am I not seeing things from their point of view? I now feel quite distant from my parents and don't want to share anything with them about my life.",

It is not as far as one could expect, we're in the same country (which is fairly small to begin with) just in different towns. We have made our relationship official back in October-November.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work a full-time job and she is in her senior year of high school (I'm 20 and she's 19), therefore the only reasonable time we could meet up would be during the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can say that we are both attracted to each other: we are often flirting with each other and she likes my other work as well (some silly youtube videos of mine and recordings of the times I went to perform stand-up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, she is pretty shy. VERY. ^(Either that or I am an idiot and being catfished without me even realizing.) She told me that her phone loses connection to wi-fi if she enters in a video call on instagram (which is the only way to contact her), I can rarely call her because she claims the reception in her town is bad and her laptop has been broken ever since we have met ^(Again, maybe I am being fooled here.) She very rarely even sends pictures of herself because she considers herself to be ugly. I try to comfort her and that she is very beautiful to me, but I still have just 2 pictures of her saved on my phone.\n\nNow, of course, because of the reasons above, I believed that we could have a face-to-face date, to make sure that the chemistry remains the same. I have started suggesting her we meet up for a date during the holidays back in late November and at first she really seemed to be into the idea. But as the date drew near she wouldn't want to plan this any further and she would answer DMs very slowly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have confronted her about it and she gave me a the following motive: because she is very shy, she very rarely answers DMs and she thought she was not ready. I have respected that and told her that I will have some more patience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am starting to suggest to her to meet up for my birthday (my birthday is very close to St. Valentine's as well, so it would be great timing) and, again, at first she seemed to be a lot into the idea. But lately, when I asked her more on these plans, she tells me that \"she doesn't know how\" we should meet up, even though I have given her only two choices that, in my opinion, would be very easy to choose from: \n\na. she comes to my hometown \n\nb. I come to hers.\n\nShe also has gastroparesis and says that she can't meet me because of her illness. Again, totally understandable, she even sent me a short video zooming up on a bag with IV fluid in the hospital.\n\nNow, in a few months it will be 1 year since we would have met each other, in August. I really want us to meet face-to-face so we can establish enough of a connection to go on holiday together by that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had other LDRs before and they all have ended because the two of us wouldn't meet due to other circumstances. I have gotten into this one, seeing that now I have the possibility to travel to another town. The only thing remaining would be for her to be on board with all of this and it would be a date. But I fear that my patience is starting to run thin and I believe that if we do not meet up during this year, I will break up with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I did that, considering that she's shy and sick, but that we have also planned this for months?",

            "input": "Am I the asshole for this?\n\nBackstory: My best friend, my sister and I decided to all move in together. Shortly after, my best friend and I began dating. (I can feel the judgement waves, cringe, I know). So it went pear shaped, we broke up. Amicable. Spent time apart. I moved on with my life as soon as possible so that I didn't drag my entire existence into living with my ex and being miserable. We had been in the new house 1 week at this point. \n\nNow, I (was) friends with his ex girlfriend. They were still friends. It was all calm. Then, he starts bringing her over and not telling anyone. I wouldn't normally care but we aren't allowed locks on our doors, he has since also left her in the house on her own. She's a snooper.\n\nMy sister starts an argument over text one night as he brings her into the house and tries to sneak her past me, while I'm standing in front of them both. This is probably the 4/5th time she's been here, and the 2nd time I've seen her walk through the door. This argument blows up. He calls me a drunk, says he does everything for us. \n\nSide note: I paid for all bills, shopping, sofas, TV, furniture, cleaned the whole house several times a week, because I was short on rent. I paid back in full. Also don't drink that often, I just had a fair amount of alcohol gifted all at once.\n\n It gets to me saying no one will stay at the house other than my sister's long term boyfriend (because she stays at his half the week, he's earned some live time in our place). He drops the bomb that his ex is now his fiance and she should be allowed to stay whenever she likes for however long she likes. I also knew it was her texting us (she excessively uses emojis, he doesn't).\n\nWe all agree that everyone will be made aware of visitors staying in the house beforehand. This brings more argument from the girlfriend, but we get agreement. \n\nEvery single weekend at 10:30pm I get a text saying she is coming over. Ok cool. He asks to have other friends over, I say yes, but I would like a weekend at some point without guests. He agrees. It's been 3 months. That weekend never came. \n\nMy sister has been staying at her boyfriends for 3 weeks (he had surgery). Finally, she comes home. Girlfriends car is outside the house. It's midnight, no text. He locked us out of the house, despite knowing we would both be home that night. They got engaged less than 2 months together after 3 years apart. She's a manipulative person, and in turn makes him a messy shit because they know it annoys me.\n\nWe had an inspection last Saturday, and they were going at it until 20 minutes before the landlord arrived. His week to clean, nothing done, I'm running around like a headless chicken cleaning because he hasn't done anything.\n\n\nI'm a uni student with a part time job. Weekend evenings are the one time I would like to be gross in my own home.\n\n\nIf you're still reading, I'm sorry. Am I the asshole for even asking him not to have her over?\n\nTLDR; ex bf gets engaged to his ex gf. Cause major arguements in the house. ",

Lobster is super expensive so two for $5 is an amazing deal.  \n\n\nPeople often come in and try a variety of different thing to get around coupon limits, splitting their order into two, having their kids pay for it at a different line, coming in a second time that day.  In cashier training our managers tell us all these ways people try to get around the limits and tells us that if we catch someone doing it we should not let them do so.  \n\n\nThe second order on my shift I run into a problem.

Lastly, this is a throwaway account as I felt more comfortable that way, Im new to reddit so this might be terribly formatted for all I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it all starts out with this friend im going to call Steve (fake names as stated previously). Steve is a good friend, usually very kind and funny. He is a bit immature at times and sometimes a bit insensitive but often there is nothing wrong and hes great fun to be around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem arises when we just play a few fun games of Overwatch (feel free to roast my taste in games lmao) and he starts making passive aggressive and toxic comments and \"jokes\" to another mutual friend im going to call Jenny. It went something along the lines of her being called \"boosted\" (term meaning that you dont deserve the rank you have) and overall insulting her over her gameplay. Now Jenny gets frustrated and tells Steve to stop, that she doesnt find it funny and reminds him that hes lower ELO than her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe keeps on saying that \"its just a joke\" and repeats that like 3 times, and it overall grinds to stalemate of them both repeating their arguments with nothing really happening. Now before I continue, Steve has a tendency to get toxic and passive aggressive ingame which is something I usually brush off. This is not just Overwatch and not just with Jenny, although they are the ones who have had the most disagreements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, Jenny ends up quitting the discord call and playing alone. I messsage Steve asking him why he didnt just stop when his joke wasnt well received. He says that \"it was just a joke\" and that he didnt mean any harm. I then message Jenny and she says that this isnt the first time hes been toxic and that she was getting really tired of it. They still get along irl but dont play together.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis might seem really minor, and it probably is, but the last few months he has been acting more and more immature and it is starting to bother me and my other friends. He always says that he doesnt mean any harm and I do believe him. He does this ingame or out of game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does this annoying thing where he always makes dick size jokes to me (asian) and other slightly racist jokes (hes white). Its all fun and good had he been able to take it as much as he dishes it out. He cant, and gets super defensive and offended when I snap back a little. That, along with him being generally immature has led me to distance myself from him. That includes avoiding playing OW with him and not hanging out with him even close to as often as before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe recently switched schools (School system in my country has 1-9 seperately from 10-12) and he went to a different one than most of us. From what I gather he doesnt have many friends at his current school as he told me, he also told me he considers me his \"best friend\". I dont consider him my best friend tho. We still hang out every now and then but I genuinely dont find it as fun, and sometimes it is downright frustrating to be with him. He has called others selfish and egoistical for telling him that he is being immature before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe hasnt had it easy before, bullying among other things. I dont know if he is doing well mentally although ive tried to ask him when appropriate but he doesnt want to talk about it, which I respect. No one in our friend group has had it easy, mentally and we try to be as supportive and caring as possible but he doesnt want any help, and acts disrespectful towards others emotions saying they should \"get thicker skin\". It feels a lot like gaslighting (I hope I used the term correctly), especially since he belittles my complaints about his behaviour every time I bring it up. Maybe Im just oversensitive tho?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole and blowing minor things out of proportion, or is Steve just a bit of an asshole himself? Am I selfish for not wanting to be with him, although he may need the support? It really does feel like I might be overreacting but at the same time not. Im curious to see what this subreddit thinks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friends makes rude comments and acts somewhat immature overall. I dont want any of that and try to distance myself, but at the same time, friend is likely going through a tough time and I feel like an asshole for not being there with him as much as I could. He says I am oversensitive, I think hes just being rude. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "Hi, all. I'm going to be a little deliberately vague about specifics, because my partner is a Redditor, too. \n\nWe're both in our 20s and have been together for nearly a decade. We just relocated to a new city for SO's career, but are making very little money and it's tough to make ends meet sometimes. We currently both work in the gig economy, so income can be unpredictable from week to week. SO comes from a wealthy family, and it's their family who is helping us out with our rent, so our primary expenses are food, gas, groceries, and utilities. \n\nWell, my SO is crazy irresponsible with finances, even with the little money we do have. Part of it isn't in their control, because they have a mental illness, and one of the main symptoms is compulsively spending. So I feel bad for criticizing their habits... but on the other hand, because SO comes from a wealthy background, I also feel that they have no concept of what it's like to budget. My SO has never had to penny-pinch or sacrifice to make ends meet. I came from a family that wasn't nearly as privileged, and regularly had to make money stretch from paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBecause of their habits, I'm completely in charge of our finances, and I hate it. SO begs me every day to eat out, or to \"treat ourselves\" because they worked hard or had a stressful day. I do empathize, but it's just not financially responsible for us. What really drives me crazy is when they beg to go out for food when we already have stuff at home. I'll even list the things we have, but they will insist that they just aren't hungry for those things. It makes me want to scream, \"So what?! Tough it out!\" But I never do. Sometimes I just give in because I'm tired of arguing about it every fucking day. \n\nSometimes to make our money stretch until payday, I skip meals. My SO never does, and that makes me resent them, if I'm totally honest.\n\nBecause when I do suggest we be more frugal, they get really upset.

Her mother was not living there at the time as she wanted to live with her current partner. She ended up selling the house, and so my partner and I began looking for places to rent.\n\nHer mother made it very clear that she would be covering my partner\u2019s share of the rent as she is currently studying at university and isn\u2019t able to work much. Additionally, she also made it clear that we were to rent a place that had three bedrooms instead of two so that she could stay if she needs to. She offered to pay the rent on that room as well. So far, no problem, everything is fine. \n\nSide note: My partner and I have a bedroom each as we need our own spaces to do things, such as study for her, and late-night computering for me.\n\nWe found a place, and everything is going fine. We just recently renewed our lease for a year. Now, during all this, her mother has only stayed overnight a few times when she was on a \u201cbreak\u201d with her partner. In the last couple months, she decided she would rent a place with her partner and go half-half in it with him. She did this after we already signed the lease.\n\nSo now, she pays rent at her place, and at our place. She has suddenly demanded that, because she doesn\u2019t stay over with us and she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even like the place\u201d that she doesn\u2019t want to pay the agreed-upon rent. She wants to now go half-half with me.\n\nIf I were to accept this, my rent would rise by around $70/week. I am already at the maximum I was willing to pay on rent before this. I explained to her that we had an agreement and have only recently renewed our lease and it isn\u2019t fair to now back out due to her not having any foresight that renting two places at once is not a good idea. \n\nI told her that I am not prepared to pay half-half, however I would increase my rent a bit to help her out. This was rejected and she then implied that if I had to pay half-half with my partner, that I would ditch her instead. That really pissed me off and she left soon after.\n\nSo, AITA here?\n\nSome side notes:\n-\tmoving to a cheaper 2-bedroom place is something we want to do, but isn\u2019t an option right now due to several factors\n-\twe wouldn\u2019t have a 3-bedroom (and more expensive) place had my partner\u2019s mother not insisted.\n-\trenting the spare room is something we are seriously considering, however we need to get permission first and we also sacrifice our privacy, so this is a last resort.",

About a month ago, she was having trouble breathing and went to the hospital. While at the hospital, we visited her and got her anything she needed. One day she said she wanted us to bring her pills that were by her bed to help her sleep. We bring the pills. \n\nJust to be sure she can take them, we checked with the doctor to make sure these pills won\u2019t interfere with anything she\u2019s already getting.  She was furious. Tried to rip the pills out of my boyfriends hand. Starts yelling and saying all kinds of hurtful things about my boyfriend (that she knows will bother him), that we don\u2019t love her, and when I try to say something she tells me to leave her family alone. We end up leaving the hospital with her yelling even though the doctor told her she was approved to get the same pills but it has to given to her by the hospital. \n\nFast forward to when she comes home: She keeps her distance from us. We keep our distance because there was no apology or thank you after we cleaned the whole house from top to bottom so she can come home to a clean, sterile environment.  She\u2019s still not fully recovered or back to her old self and after a while, my boyfriend puts their differences aside and tries to be there for her. I talk to her here and there. \n\nOne thing he\u2019s always done and expected from me as well is kissing his mom on the cheek before we leave the house and when we come back home. I used to do it before but stopped after the whole situation. Since she\u2019s still not back to normal, I try to start doing it again but when I kiss her on the cheek now I get the cold shoulder. She turns her head away from me and doesn\u2019t kiss me back. You ever tried to kiss or hug someone and they obviously didn\u2019t want it? That feeling. \n\nWhen my BF does it she kisses him back. It hurts my feelings when my kiss is obviously not wanted and so I stop doing it. It ruins my mood and my boyfriend is upset that I don\u2019t do it anymore, that she\u2019s sick and I should put my feelings aside. Am I the asshole? ",

            "input": "It\u2019s a long story, so please bare with me. \n\nMy father has always been very possessive, manipulative, and materialistic. When I was young he would say things to me like, \u201cYou better come to lunch with your grandparents, because they\u2019re very wealthy and if you don\u2019t spend time with them they won\u2019t put you in their will.\u201d After my mother divorced him, basically anything he owned was made possible by my grandmother. When she bought a home with her new husband, she gave her previous home to my dad for free. This really tainted my relationship with both of them, because every interaction felt like a transaction. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, my mother projected a lot of her problems with my dad onto me. This made it very easy for my dad to manipulate me into hating her, because her accusations made me identify with my dad more and, having heard them all before, he knew just what to say to make her seem like the antagonist of my life. For this reason, I moved out of her house, and lived with my dad for most of High School. After I graduated, my older brother moved in and reignited abuse that I hadn\u2019t suffered since before he moved out of my mothers house when I was in middle school. With this, I began to notice the ways in which my dad was irresponsible, and that it was making it harder for me to be self sufficient and go to college. I decided to move back in with my mother, because I knew she would be kind, but push my ass to be more productive. My father viewed this as a great betrayal. He kept gifts he\u2019d given me for himself, including the truck he\u2019d given me for my 16th birthday. He contacted me less and less. Even ignoring my birthdays. \n\nThis put a wedge between me and my grandmother. I began to think often of middle school and the months before my grandfather died. He had long been incontinent and grew increasingly senile. It made me sad and I pitied him. It was not my intention for him to notice, but he had. He asked me if I hated him, and it tore me apart. I was too young to understand my feelings or know how to respond. Before long, he died. As an adult, I resolved not to let my grandmother ever think I hated her because of what happened with my dad. I visited her on her birthday and told her what happened with grandpa, and that I would always love her. Still, part of me always remembered what my dad had said. I had to have a good relationship with my grandmother, or she wouldn\u2019t put me in her will. Am I only doing this for that reason?\n\nSeveral months later, my brother contacted my mother, and told her that my grandmother was sick. By then she was already in the hospital, and couldn\u2019t recognize him. My brother criticized me for not visiting her, but I didn\u2019t want to see her like that. To me it didn\u2019t serve any purpose to see her in pain. To look on her with pity, and know she didn\u2019t recognize me. Months went by, and anytime I heard from my brother, through my mom, he would say she was still sick, maybe better in one area, but worse in another. \n\nUntil one day I received an email from my dad. She had died, several days before the date of the email, and the funeral was tomorrow. Ultimately I chose not go. My excuses were that it was short notice, im irreligious, my dad would lord his disapproval over me, and I was better off grieving alone. That same young part of me, instilled by my dad, wanted to go, because what if she left something for me in her will and I wasn\u2019t there to claim it, but I refused to let that fantasy define our relationship, our final words together had been enough of a goodbye. I wouldn\u2019t let my dad ruin a time that was meant for me to grieve and remember her for the love we shared. \n\nSince then my brother has said that he is depressed. He lives alone in the house that my dad vacated so he could move into my grandmother\u2019s newer home. He believed that she would surely leave something for him in her will, because he\u2019d spent so much time with her, and of course my dad had used the same manipulations on him, but apparently she left him nothing. Everything went to my dad. \n\nMy heart tells me I made the right choices, but I\u2019ve always worried that maybe I really was a jerk. Especially after I saw a similar post where a guy didn\u2019t want to go to his relatives funeral and everyone told him he was wrong and should go. \n\nI genuinely want to know what people think. Did I do the right thing, or AITA?\n\n",

I\u2019ve constantly tried to get her to come out to parties with me or do other things, but she always either blames her boyfriend or last minute says she doesn\u2019t feel good or is \u201ctired\u201d and wants to stay in instead.

(I wish i was exaggerating, but i\u2019m not.. and the weekends he didn\u2019t visit, she went home) and when they visit, they never want to do anything. They usually just sit in her room for hours only to leave occasionally to make food or go out to eat.\n\nI told her that I kind of considered living on my own for senior year bc her boyfriend was always here and even when he wasn\u2019t she didn\u2019t want to ever do anything with me. She explained she was kind of hurt by me saying this and it was a wake up call to her to try and change her patterns and make the most of her college experience. Bc she agreed to this, i agreed to resign our lease with her for next year.\n\nthings were relatively okay up until about a week ago when I felt I was being very helpful and generous to her; offering her rides to go get groceries (she doesn\u2019t have a car), driving her to her internship so she didn\u2019t have to deal with the bus, giving advice on things with family, helping her with resume stuff, etc. So when I asked if she\u2019d maybe want to go to a party with me that following weekend I figured she\u2019d maybe say yes since I was pretty generous to her and this was something I wanted to do, right? Nope.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that she gave the same \u201cmy bf wouldn\u2019t be happy if I went\u201d excuse when I asked but I just eventually shrugged it off and decided maybe we can just do something the next night instead. I suggested it, she said maybe, and then her boyfriend announces he\u2019s coming to visit her (even though she saw him last weekend and will see him again next weekend for valentine\u2019s day). And, yup, you guessed it, they were in her room the whole weekend. Oh, and they also smoked weed to the point where I could smell it through the whole apartment (i don\u2019t mind the smell, it\u2019s just a little distracting and annoying to smell it at 1am the night before Monday classes). \n\nI basically decided that I\u2019ve given up. I\u2019m done offering rides, suggesting to do things together, trying to be a friend, etc. bc i feel like i\u2019m just being used or taken for granted. I\u2019m literally her only girl friend she has, and i\u2019m kind of starting to maybe see why. \n\nBc I\u2019ve given up, I didn\u2019t text her this morning about walking to classes together (we have the exact same schedule since were in the same major) and she didn\u2019t end up even coming to class. Why? bc her boyfriend stayed at the apartment until 3pm Monday. \n\nTL;DR: AITA for basically giving up on a friendship that started off my freshman year of college, bc my friend has basically chosen her boyfriend over me and let\u2019s him control her life despite me offering lots of assistance and help for her?",

Things are better than ever and we question our decision to divorce every day. We had been seeing each other off and on throughout the entire separation, going back and forth between wanting to make it work and wanting to move on. At one point during our moving on stage, her and my best friend hooked up. This is the guy I entrusted her with while I was deployed, as she's a bit of a social hermit, and I knew she'd need someone to keep her company (I know, I know, the irony).

We divorced about 6 months after I returned home, and 6 months later they slept together.\n\nNow, I understand that this was her attempt to move on, and I'm not mad at her about that. I slept with other people during this stage as well. What I'm upset about is that my friend was okay with this. I hesitate to call it \"bro code,\" as I feel that cheapens the concept, but I feel like there is a code of ethics amongst friends. An agreement to respect sensitive situations like this. He doesn't know that I know, and I haven't spoken to him since. I feel like 6 months is way too soon for a friend to get involved like that. I feel like he should have contacted me somehow, to let me know what was occurring, not for my permission, because they're grown adults and can do what they want, but to at least respect our friendship. To my understanding, he refuses to talk about it with her.
