Firstly, I felt I was drinking water that had been poured into a glass that used to have Pepto Bismol in it, but had not been rinsed out first. Secondly, I thought maybe it tasted more like truvia had been simply mixed with water into a sickening solution. Third, it made me think that i now know what it would be like to drink generic birch beer after someone else had thrown it up. And, lastly, when i finally gave up, as if giving up on a bet, it just tasted like hostility and sadness.  Do yourself a favor and try a different flavor!  One caveat- Usually, when a company screws up any kind of ginger ale, it is because they seem to make it taste soapy. Kudos to Blue Sky for finding a whole new way to make ginger ale so vile.

Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.  Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.  Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.  In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. \n Summary: melted lolipops from Oriental Trading",

            "input": "I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.  There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.  CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.  ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½\" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.  STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.  CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.  WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12\" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.  CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)  All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to \"contain 4-5 horses \", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time. \n Summary: Easy Assembly - Great for Alpacas!",

The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.

First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.  I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.  They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.  So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!  They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.  So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.  Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.

Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  \"Oh - it's still this toy, huh?\"  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.  This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.

I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, \"normal\" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.  This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.  My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!)

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity. \n Summary: Read this article first",

With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.  This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time! \n Summary: Excellent popcorn",

            "input": "Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.  Ingredients: 1-1 ½ lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2\" cubes 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt Salt 3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste  1 (generous) tsp cumin seed 1 (generous) tsp mustard seed 1 small onion diced 3 cloves garlic diced 2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes 2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice ½ cup frozen peas 2-3 tbsp cooking oil Salt to taste  1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about ½ tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables 2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot 3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn. 4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn. 5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize. 6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low. 7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through. 8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste. 9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard. \n Summary: The Best Curry Around!",

I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a \"treat\". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on \"Newman's Own\" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again. \n Summary: Two Malamutes and a Husky Say \"eh\"",

In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not \"slivered\" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.  So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased. \n Summary: Too Much Sugar!",

Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.  I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.  After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just \"something she picked up,\" but the dog food itself.  Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.

Copied from FDA web site.  FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...] \n Summary: Happy Hips - made in China",

The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.  I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.  I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.  NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:  ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. *********  I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.  The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach. Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans. \n Summary: Made in Michigan since 1866",

Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my brand name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.  Strike one - utterly stale Strike two - not returnable Strike three - no declaration of ingredients pre-purchase, only offensive legal CYA  [Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date) - those rules are growing on me!]  I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward.

I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.  Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.

The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.  Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample. \n Summary: YUMMY!!!",

For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.

I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned. I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co-worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was \"the very best pancake mix\":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some \"real\" organic, light amber, maple syrup. This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know! Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff! That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS! It was the pancake mix that made the difference. Now I am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.

Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.  The canned food is great, too.  September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it. \n Summary: Quality dog food delivered to your door!",

I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.  I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to \"paint\" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.  In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.  I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.  If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base. \n Summary: Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful",

I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO\">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> ) \n Summary: Popchips vs Baked Lays? Baked Lays taste MUCH better.",

The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.  I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it. \n Summary: Perfect for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies",

I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his \"treat\", looked at it as if to say, \"You've GOT to be KIDDING!\" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.

And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.

This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  \"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want.\" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious \"diet\" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.

My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences. Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken.

That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen \"ice\" paks.

I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.  Years ago \"Grecian Delight\" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.  The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.  I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool.

Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness. \n Summary: Good Flavor but dry beans",

I suggest finding a way to taste one piece of this before committing to buy an entire case.  For comparison, I would recommend \"Stonewall's Jerquee\" (soy, vegetarian, available on Amazon). Stonewalls has a better, chewer,\"meatier\" texture, soft enough to bite into, but drier and firm enough to chew for a short while. It comes in 7 flavors, none of which were unpleasant, like this Primal Strips flavor.  Another tasty soy/meatless similar product is \"Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless\" (4 flavors, on Amazon).

Keurig has changed the pumps in their design at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps; it's the valves.  The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a goo whack on the bottom. Really this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for.  More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal.

And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its \"food\". and the company who makes it basically said \"Sorry, but it sucks to be you\". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use. \n Summary: Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.",

So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, \"Hey, that's the perfect solution!\". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed \"scrap\" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to \"re-label\" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!  I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the \"smaller\" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at \"perfect levels\" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever!

            "input": "I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans. \n Summary: Sojos original",

After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.  I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again. \n Summary: K",

It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.  TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.  BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.  VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.  Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.

I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.

So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing \"accelerated testing\" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.

And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not \"added\" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.  The can says it is \"Orange Tangerine\" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some \"gum acacia\", \"natural flavors and colors\" and some \"ascorbic acid(vitamin C)\". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added \"soy\". Soy?  I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.  I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad. \n Summary: Syrupy tasting, Unlikeable flavor. Yuk!",

Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.  I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.  For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?  I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.  If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them. \n Summary: Not for everyone.. but I love it!",

Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.  I know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but I really just want to taste the clams when I have a bowl of New England clam chowder.

Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.  Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.  You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.  Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.  Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.  Enjoy! \n Summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack",

Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick.

            "input": "If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.  We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.  The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.  We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don't like it then don't buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.  The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.  I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it. \n Summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower",

Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.  Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.  Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.

I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the \"just add water\" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion.

REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.

Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.

It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.  Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use \"natural flavors\" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called \"effervescent decaffeination\" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.  On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, \"Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness.\" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.  I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday.

It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:  Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.  I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.

I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.  So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.  Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.

Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.  I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal.

            "input": "We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)  Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"  Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.  Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.  So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:    * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)   * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces   * a combination of the above two factors   * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract   o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease   o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation   o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage  Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.  Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.  Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.  When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.    The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.  The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top  Bottle fed infants are \"a whole 'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.  The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.  The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top  Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:    * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.   * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).    Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:    Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"    \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"    For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.    * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.   * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.   * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)   * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)  Top  Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:    * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.    The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.    * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.

So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good !

After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the \"astronaut\" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.  Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.  It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.  With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product. \n Summary: I don't know what I'd do without this...",

I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:  \"\"Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.\"\"  Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as \"unadulterated\" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.  I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.  \"\"What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.\"\"  If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.  Thank you for your time. -Amy  PS. I used to be one of those \"organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?\" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than \"oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it.\" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier.

Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the \"soup\" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.  Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.

A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.

One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use - it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.  I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!  UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their \"fix.\") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded \"half cup\" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.  I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better - like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am. \n Summary: Thinking about being a repeat customer",

An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month. Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels.

However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google \"pill pockets diarrhea\", you will see this is an occasional known side effect. Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds. \n Summary: artificial",

It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein. \n Summary: My baby's favorite 2nd stage food so far and great for constipation!",

He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs.

I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!! \n Summary: Something has changed",

After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.  Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?  Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?  One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.  So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.  The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.  With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.  This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give. \n Summary: Lots of fluff, not a lot of stuff",

She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a>  Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.  In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.  Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula.

I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an Oreo.  Oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they're Oreos, come on.  A cool fact I found out when I was looking up ingredients for Whonu Chocolate Sandwich cookies and Oreos, the first ingredient in regular Oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies I think it is flour.  I found that interesting for some reason.

(I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :) \n Summary: I would give Harmony Farms extra stars if I could!",

While at the Norway part of Epcot at Disney FL this year I found the same thing. Then I realized it is a company brand name made in Finland not a zoo promotion. I bought some more.

And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being \"off the grid\".  The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.  A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.  This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.  This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger.

In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins.  The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.

When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed! \n Summary: Warning: Contains Menadione",

I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.  Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH.

Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle \"aroma.\"  When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.  Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.

In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe. \n Summary: Misleading",

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).  Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it. \n Summary: My every day green tea",

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.  As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.  Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.  I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.  Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.  I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.  I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.  For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.  This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.  All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.  I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great. \n Summary: Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!",

With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.

If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.  I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).

Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.  I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.

I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.  Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.  Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.  So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.

I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee.

            "input": "Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.  The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.  Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says \"Not a significant source of protein.\"  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.  I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.  Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.  To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.  I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way. \n Summary: A poor choice",

I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.  I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.  \"Stacey\"'s review sold me on it:  \"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.  Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".  My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. \" \n Summary: Not what I thought",

            "input": "This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is \"natural\", I would not agree with the \"alternative to soda\" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.  The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.  Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.  Not recommended, sorry. \n Summary: Didn't like the flavor, aftertaste, or quantity",

They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact.

I didn't really like this thing too much.  For starters, there is too much packaging for my liking.  Too many things to throw away.  And I agree with a previous reviewer that they're kind of big cartons for how much they hold.  Inside the container are 4 packages - one for noodles, and three for various seasonings.  Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.  The one from Trader Joe's only has two packets - one for noodles, one for sauce - and no water involved.  Just microwave for 2 minutes and you're done.  And those are a lot tastier.  I didn't like the texture of this thing (everything clumped together too much) and it really didn't have much taste, especially considering the three different packets of seasoning I put in.  Time to try a couple of the other brands of these things... \n Summary: Eh...",

That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.  McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey. \n Summary: Best of the Instant Oatmeals",

Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.  I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.

Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.  I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.

We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say \"Natural\" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!? \n Summary: Quality for a good price",

Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.  Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8. Software: Garage Band. Mic: Shure SM57.  Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.  Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.  For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4. \n Summary: I love it",

I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy. \n Summary: ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems",

Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.  I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats.

            "input": "I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.  Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.  I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:  Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is \"sweet\" BBQ. Everyone else loved them. Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags) Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter. Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag  I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account. \n Summary: This picky eater loves them (most flavors)",

            "input": "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.  I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.  My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.  I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.  For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.  We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.  A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.  So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.  I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.  Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage. \n Summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more",

The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew. Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere. Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed. \n Summary: 2yr in the making",

Is everyone using the same mix or what? Reviews from \"its great\" to \"its horrible\"..like a total 50/50 split. SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix.

With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.

First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.

Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a \"diet\" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being \"too salty\" or \"high in sodium\". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is. \n Summary: Tasty, Crunchy, and Filling",

Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.  IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE  Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \"100 calorie packs\" -- 4.5 inches across!  WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\" & \"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL  2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES  BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES  As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history. \n Summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?",

The main value is as a unique gift.   In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.   Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.

I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.  When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a \"test\" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.  So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  \"Icicle compatibility with Windows 7\", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.  Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle \"techs\" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us \"technical support\", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.  I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.  If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7. \n Summary: Blue Icicle - does not work with Windows 7!",

I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.  I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk. $5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for the same amount of servings? Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet. I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy 6lbs of cocoa mix at one time.

Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.

No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, \"My kids will only eat Earth's Best!\" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.  Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has \"applesauce\" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.  Shame on Earth's Best as a company.

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.  Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?  As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.  I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except \"sweets,\" of course.  My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...  Have I told you how much I love them?

I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.  The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.  I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!  The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more \"plain\" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.

This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.  I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.  Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon. \n Summary: Not for me",

Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.  Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)  One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.)

            "input": "I bought this mainly because another review (can't remember if it was on Amazon or another site) said it was better than Morningstar Farms crumbles and because it is GMO free. Now, I've been a vegetarian since I was thirteen (and that was decades ago), but I am the sort that DOES want fake meat resembling meat. I've little interest in a mushroom-quinoa burger; I want a meaty-yet-vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side. Also, I'm a professional chef, so I'm very picky about the foods I eat.  I'm saying this because I think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review.  Tonight, I used the Harmony Valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese. I also did the same recipe with the MF crumbles to compare. Two things I was curious about:  1) flavor: they're *kind of* about the same, especially considering I was adding a browned mirepoix, marmite, and veg Worcestershire ... I guess I should fry up a patty of just the HV mix, but I did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay, but blander than MF  2) texture: MF wins. It just does (sorry, MF haters). It has larger pieces with a more meat-like texture. Plus, even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove, the HV was too wet.  Now, the reviewer who also liked it better than MF also said something about it holding together on its own and that MF doesn't. Well, that's true. This was thick and stuck to itself, much more like the texture of ground meat - if you were to puree it. I use MF often in meatballs, and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese. I guess that's the difference; I don't just want to thaw or add water and *poof* have dinner. I expect to cook with an ingredient, the same as I would with real beef.  So I wasn't bowled over in those ways, but I liked it. HV hamburger mix is good and I'm sure it will be useful, which is also a plus - no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles, you've got a half dozen packets at home. I have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living, so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home. And although I've seen some reviews complaining about the 15-20 wait for the HV mix to absorb water in the fridge ... really? Those people can't wait half an hour for a burger? If you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup, buy a frozen burger. I think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and I look forward to trying!  Addendum:  After eating the lasagna made with the HV mix, both my husband and I experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain. I'm apparently a glutton for punishment, though, because I decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday. Not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones (made with MF crumbles and Lightlife sausage), they had a sort of rubbery texture that I really did not care for. But, blander and texture I can overlook, except AGAIN, the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas.

Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.  To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.  Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them.

Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it \"Canidae\" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add!

My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and \"deep\"). I have also tried many of the products offered by \"Two Leaves and a Bud\" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).  This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).  The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).  Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & \"bitty\" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.  I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM\">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.  Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.  My advice: buy a single box of this first.

I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs!

I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.  Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.  Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).  Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.  If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications). \n Summary: Caramel flavor, excellent for baking and toppings (tips for using agave, too)",

They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!

Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise. -Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged. -Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market. -Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type. -Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the \"potato\" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste. I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in.

Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.

Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.

First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.  After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.  If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it? \n Summary: now i know whats wrong with my dog",

Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article  Mozaffarian et al \"Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,\" The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006).  Here are a few quotations from this article:  \"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [\"coronary heart disease\"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. \"heart attacks\"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.\"  Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:  \"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.\"  They conclude  \"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.\"  Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook \"nutritional epidemiology\", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book \"Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating.\" \n Summary: Not My Taste Preference",

            "input": "As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You! \n Summary: NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!",

One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end?

The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. \n Summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!",

What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.

Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.  However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).  O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.  Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says \"O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.  Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try. \n Summary: Tasty.",

The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild \"spam\"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why! Due to the higher calories and higher price, I will only stock this as emergency food. I will buy more for that reason. \n Summary: when you have no fridge but want meat, what do you do?",

However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.  The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.  I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them! \n Summary: Rishi Tea Loose Leaf Tea Bags",

I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.  The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.  The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.  I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really.

Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"  Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.  You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common \"fruit\" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of \"fructose\" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of \"pretend\" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.

That is NO longer the case.  Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a \"hot spot\" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an \"allergic reaction.\"  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!  Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.  In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.  It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.  ******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural.

And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)  Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.  This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is \"store fat!\" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the \"during taste\" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)

That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.

There's no problem with the Blue Icicle itself though. There would be a problem when trying to install this with Windows 7. There was no problem at all using it with Windows XP. It seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being 'Blue Icicle'. Instead, it would show up as 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device'. It just didn't sound the same when I was using it with Windows XP. It sounded more louder with some feedback in the background. What I did to fix this problem was to uninstall the 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device' driver from Device Manager, then unplug the Icicle and plug it back in. When the 'Installing device driver software' notification pops up, click it and click 'Skip obtaining driver software from Windows Update'. It will now be installed as 'Blue Icicle' and work like how it should be! Make sure you raise the levels up in Sound in Control Panel if the mic sounds too low for you, even with the Gain Control Volume up; it shouldn't be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem, but I hope this helps whoever does!  When I first got the Icicle, it sounded amazing and I had a lot of fun with it! I still do, too! I use this with my Audio-Technica AT2020. I use it almost everyday, whether if it's for music producing or online gaming with friends.

I tried to leave \"no stars\" or fewer cuz, I felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers, I spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled, \"PURE CARROT\" Juice. Lakewood's knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design. I can easily read \"PURE CARROT\" and \"PURE\" again, just above the illustration of \"CARROTS ONLY\" (but nada lemons), but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the CARROTS ONLY illustration (sans lemons), it mentions \"enriched with lemons\", 1% to be exact, which means 99% of their marketing team make O'Donnell look constitutionally wise.  Intentional or not, it aint the keenest marketing approach to \"thinking\" consumers. To paraphrase a wiser woman, \"You might want to rethink those ties.\" (LABELS in this case)~ E.Brockovich ~.  Even Juicy Juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products.  Today's McFly FYI and word of the day is \"PURE\", and brought to you from my sponsor, \"Merriam Webster\": PURE : unmixed with any other matter. As in Gold, Pure Gold, Jerry. (I watch tv and commercials, does it show?)

Finding the PURE BS or at least 99.9% requires no zoom, matter of fact arms length, like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected.  Ok Lakewood, so, think what you will about my criticism be it glib, harsh, frank, curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong.  On the other hand, I think not but I would love to be proven wrong.  Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, \"carrots and lemons\" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, \"lemons and carrots.\"  All I am saying, is give 3's a chance! In a world of scams, rip-offs and misconceptions and misdirection...be honest and be excellent to one another.  No hard feelings, right?

Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store  EDIT: Oct 11, 2012  *****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****  So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.  Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received. \n Summary: Great tasting snack...if you get the Japanese Pocky",

The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the \"modern\" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for \"hill\"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the \"cream\" in between.  Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.  But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.  These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: \"Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees\").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit. \n Summary: Great Taste!!!",

The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.

I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.

It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.  Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.  Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.  In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats. \n Summary: The cats weren't impressed!",

I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.  Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.  After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.  The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.  I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money. \n Summary: Nothing Miraculous Here",

My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.   I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.   I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too? For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first. \n Summary: Some broken jars",

The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured. Here is the response in full:  ------------------------------------------------------------  Thank you for your purchase and inquiry. We understand your concerns because food item are very personal. If you can spear a few moments to read details about our quality assurance, it would be appreciated.

We hope we have assisted you correctly.  Thank you.  Kind regards,  Julie Mrs Mays  ------------------------------------------------------------  I've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops, Communism, and carbon footprint. To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.  I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.  Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it. \n Summary: great snack",

If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.  Why eat a nutritionally empty \"100 calorie pack\" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??  I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.  Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:  Calories 80 (10 from fat) Total Fat 1g Cholesterol 35mg Sodium 15mg Total Carb 0g Protein 18g Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg  You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says \"in water\" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.  I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs. \n Summary: Handy Size",

I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).

While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.

To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.

On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan. \n Summary: Bubble liquid",

After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\".

She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle!

            "input": "Little lesson on TRUFFLES... Truffles graded \"Extra\" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked \"brushed\" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.  Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle \"look\", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.  Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example \"JR Mushrooms & Specialties\" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). \n Summary: If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish & NO Flavor--then this is it!",

VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more.

Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.  I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.  Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.  Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.  Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!  Hope this helps you decide to try them.

            "input": "I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for \"Best in Show,\" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.

And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.  I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.  I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets! \n Summary: wrong size",

It is also known as hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia or powdered baking ammonia. It is still called for in some recipes especially for cookies.

I saw that she measured the ingredients \"incorrectly\" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.

Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.  Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)  One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.)

Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by \"that other chain\" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.  With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.  So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.  I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands. \n Summary: Not a fan of this blend",

I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!  Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.

            "input": "I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.  WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.  Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed. But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!  Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )  I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me! These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours (paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)  The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:  Potatoes Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil), Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey), Rice Powder Sugar Salt Onion Powder Tomato Powder Paprika Torula Yeast Garlic Powder Chili Pepper Citric Acid Cayenne Pepper Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour) Natural Smoke Flavour  Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!  Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key. Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production  As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!  Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )  These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE, are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!  Flavoured potato PERFECTION! \n Summary: C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E )",

            "input": "We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck. \n Summary: Kitty Junk Food",

After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.  As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.  The company is acting as if nothing is wrong.

They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.  I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.

Martek advertises this formula on their website!  \"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents\".  Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be \"agricultural ingredients.\" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as \"necessary vitamins and minerals,\" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:  Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and \"other\" undisclosed ingredients) Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol) Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium Heavily processed ingredients that are far from \"natural\"  quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.  This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula: AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg  Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: \"includes mutant organisms\" and \"recombinant organisms\", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is \"extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.\"  The patent for Life'sARA states: \"genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid\" and \"extraction with solvents such as ... hexane.\" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.  Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.  BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.  Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom  The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health. \n Summary: THIS IS NOT ORGANIC!!!

I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a \"splash of pineapple\" so I figured I'd give it a go. The woman at the counter said \"are you sure you want that? It's $4.\" Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda. I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.  It's amazing. I was happy to find it on Amazon - as I'm definitely hooked. Since I have Prime shipping, it gets to me in 2 days (if I order it right, that is!) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock. I'm totally thrilled with this stuff. \n Summary: Delicious and refreshing",

I decided to order from Amazon and tried it this morning.  This pancake mix is very fine and powdery. When I made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. The mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. The waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 Tbsp. of melted butter, which I never use that much when I use the Rob's Red Mill pancake mix. I could only make two perfect 7\" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. However, I also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. I guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands. And I do not understand what ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like Cinnamon and Apple, etc.  In short, I am going back to my Rob's Red Mill brand, at least I know what I am digesting in my stomach. \n Summary: Disappointed with my first farmhouse pancake",

Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.  The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.  The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.  My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!  My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.  I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!  I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.  If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.  I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you. \n Summary: Delicious",

Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.  Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.

This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.   The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes.

The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the \"cane juice\" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.  I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes. \n Summary: Sugar, lots.

I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:  - It tasted like rope - It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle - It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet - It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa - It tasted like chewing on tree bark  In all seriousness, the \"rope\" & \"wet hemp bracelet\" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the \"organic\" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.  Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.  On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.  So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.  Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.  We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.  The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.  Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.  Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.

            "input": "from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:  Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.  Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.  It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word \"Agave\" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.  Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as \"diabetic friendly\". What's not to like?  As it turns out, quite a lot.  Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.  All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.  Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.  Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .  And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.  In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.  \"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".  Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you. \n Summary: It may not be what you think it is",

The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.  The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  \"It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,\" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 \"recycle\" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?

If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something \"healthlier.\" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).  I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.  I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.  I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.  There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.  The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.  I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is. \n Summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea",

And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)  Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.  We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.  Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.  I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible! \n Summary: CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!",

So my love of food has driven me to learn how to make decent versions of food I like which are gluten and dairy free.  I am now a MASTER pizza chef, to put it modestly.  Practically a PIZZA GOD.  I've got the pizza stone, the piel, found the best gf crust, the best df cheese, and the result is usually pretty great.  ANYWAY...  I like mushrooms on my pizza, specifically SLICED mushrooms, and I make pizza at home often enough that checking out at the grocery store with 20 or 30 cans of sliced mushrooms draws awkward stares.  The solution, of course, is to order in bulk via Amazon.  Have done this many times, trying out different brands, etc.  I'm almost certain I'd purchased this exact product in the past with no issues...but this latest shipment brought with it a harrowing ordeal involving smelly mushrooms and untopped pizzas.  At first I thought I might have gotten a bad can, so I tossed the first stinky one.  Then the next one smelled just as bad.  Now - the smell isn't a rotten smell or an unnatural smell.  The best way I can describe it is a combination of normal canned mushroom smell and... horse shit.  If you don't know what horse shit smells like just imagine dog shit with a lot of hay and some mud mixed in.  So I stopped there and made my pizza without toppings.  The next day or two when I made another pizza I decided maybe my sense of smell had been off before and to try opening another can of mushrooms from the same case.  Same fecal smell.  Even after extensive rinsing it smelled like I had been rinsing the mushrooms in an unflushed toilet bowl.  I had my wife smell the can (oh, she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually, no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.  When next I went to the grocery store (actually, Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.  So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like, as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!  (In case anyone is wondering, this is not a joke, even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.) \n Summary: NOTHING like regular pasta",

English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake.

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion.

These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!  These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.  I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.  I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy.

You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol! \n Summary: Warning!

The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.  I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste.

It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.  Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.

I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than \"cut\" cubes by other producers.  The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.

But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own.

Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.  This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.  Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.  Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications.

This food does not \"rifle\" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.  I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.  If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust.

They contain a lot of \"Wow!\" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.  The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...  Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.  The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.  And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.  The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags.

That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.  It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack. \n Summary: Oreo Crisps",

They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.  I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.  List of ingredients: Sugar 62g per 100g Glucose-fructose syrup Lemons Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate Flavoring: Lemon Oil Color:Caramel E150C   Price with shipping slightly over $11.  I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!  8/22/11 Update Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant. Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try. \n Summary: not the greatest vegan product",

The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.  Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff. I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax! Flavor is a complete bust.  Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un-popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)  No stars for flavor Five stars for popcorn. Overall: One star. There is no need to pay an upcharge for powder that will render your popcorn inedible. \n Summary: Product is OK but company was WORST policy ever",

In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage. Also used in:    Tyre sealant   Rubber cleaner   De-icer   Stain removers   Fabric softener   Degreaser   Paint   Adhesive   Wallpaper stripper  I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded.... \n Summary: We poured ours out",

She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds. \n Summary: Too small",

It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.  I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.  The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it.

Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.  This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.

What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.  But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.  I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!

Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.  Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.

Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.  Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens. \n Summary: Equidorian OJio Arriba Carillo \"RAW Oranic\" Cacao",

I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it. \n Summary: Not the same tea...",

It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals).

            "input": "I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.  I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their \"mix\" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of \"betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.\"  Boo on Betty Crocker. \n Summary: a total scam",

The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.  He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.  I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it.

Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.

First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.

Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the \"artificial flavors\" used?  Be forewarned! \n Summary: Chemical aftertaste - thought it was the coffeemaker, but it was the coffee",

Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

            "input": "MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Hey guys, So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs. So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!  THEIR ANSWER  Dear Dave,  Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.  Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5. Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.  The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.  Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.  If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.  DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs  Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.  Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.  However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.  Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.  The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.   (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, \"The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,\" Allergy 56; 5:403  I hope this information is helpful to you.

I was looking around and came across these, \"natural,\" flavored bones and thought.... \"SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!\" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer).

So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it.

            "input": "This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.  I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.  The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.  The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2\" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.  The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.  The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.  I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.  The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.  The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.  The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.  This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence. \n Summary: Easy Setup, Nice Design",

Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.  These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of \"calms\" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.  Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not \"crispy\" cookies, or the blurb would say \"crispy,\" rather than \"chewy.\"  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.  Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.  Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.

If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for \"White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,\" \"Green Tea Papaya Nectar\" and \"Green Tea Sugar Cookies.\" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea.

My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae. \n Summary: Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers",

The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.  The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.

I'm using it with a Behringer ecm8000 mic and Real Time Analyzer (RTA) software (on my laptop running WindowsXP PRO SP3) to precisely tune notch filters and speaker crossover networks and it works perfectly.  Audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope, with peaks at 90 degrees (which is a good sign).  No hissing sounds at all, it's very quiet with a mic connected, high frequency-spectrum wise.  For the record, I bought a usb to Toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop/PC sound cards are usually noisy as hell.  I think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources (e.g. cheesy soundcards, amps, receivers or multimedia speakers), or even lousy, improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit, but who knows.  What I can safely say is, for the cheap price, the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum.  WINDOW7 FUNCTIONALITY(updated): At first, it didn't work with WINDOWS7 x64 Ultimate.  I kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver.  And at the time the Icicle website made no mention of Windows 7 compatibility (2 months later, they are saying it's compatible with XP, VISTA and Windows 7).  After nearly giving up, I found my old USB motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini-usb header to the that of the Icicle's.  I connected the Icicle using the motorola cable into my Windows 7 PC, and to my surprise it was recognized.  I actually got the idea when the Icicle began losing its USB connection (with the original cable) whenever I moved it around a lot.  Could it be the dinky looking USB cable included with the Icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with Windows 7?  I'm really not sure at this point.  What I can say is that the Blue Icicle seems 100% reliable when used with the old Motorola USB cable.  Perhaps the Motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding--who knows.  (I'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original Icicle cable just see if it's shielded to the USB's electrical ground source.  It wouldn't be the first time I find an unshielded USB cable.  Then again, it might be the mini-USB header causing the problem.) \n Summary: Icicle on Mac OS X",

I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz \"Angel hair\" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that \"THIS IS OUR POLICY\" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ \"Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

I've made 3 pots:  First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.  Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.  Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.  So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called \"Eight O'Clock\" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.  My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.  Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better. \n Summary: Inexpensive coffee lacking in flavor",

Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.  Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.  Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).  By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say \"no *added* sugar\", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying \"no sugar\" or \"no sucrose\" (table sugar).  disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one. \n Summary: Liquid Lollipops",

By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.  I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.  Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt. \n Summary: Way too SALTY!!",

It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear \"skin\" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce.

The product arrived with a rubber \"rope\" with a ball-like bulge on the outside, and a cone-shaped plug on the inside, rather than the actual rope pictured on the page. For the first 3 days, it was wonderful. She was very excited and interested in how it worked, and it seemed to keep her occupied. On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber \"rope\". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat. I would only recommend this product if your dog is a VERY weak chewer. \n Summary: The \"rope\" is actually rubber. Chewed through it in seconds.",

I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.  Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.  It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.  No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.  You can go down to the local \"name of popular coffee shop here\" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.  Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..

So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.  I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was. \n Summary: Not like the wheatgrass in stores",

After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.  Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.  I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.  My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.  UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a \"fair shake\", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a \"bad batch\" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat \"favorites\" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???  I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into \"fish broth\", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on \"fish water\" doesn't sound like a good deal to me. \n Summary: My cat likes the broth",

All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel - thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor. \n Summary: fantastic product",

I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored \"cake\".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash. \n Summary: Very Disappointed",

In fact, they're really no different than the run-of-the-mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price.

The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical-like aroma. Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it.

            "input": "I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.  Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.  I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.  This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.  BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.  *For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options. \n Summary: Match Your Mic Carefully",

Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.  Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!  Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.  I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM\">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG\">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.  One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.  Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product. \n Summary: Do I think they help? Yes.",

The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as \"illegal\" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that \"coca leaf\" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]  DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.  If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.

The gel comes out insanely fast and sloppy and I could never manage to moderate it to a slow and steady release.  Once set, the ants barely even noticed it was there.  If I had to guess, I'd say that maybe 5-10% of the ants coming in and out of my house ever fell for the trap.  Some would just go near it and then walk away.  It managed to kill off a few, but not the colony.  Not even close.  The guy who gave it a 5-star review must not have heard of Combat.  MUCH better bait.

            "input": "As an Oregonian, I make a point of sharing these Oregon-made snacks with friends who visit the state. I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.  Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.  Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"  I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA\">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.  The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.  In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com. \n Summary: One bite and you'll become a \"chippoisseur\"",

White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.  I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins). \n Summary: powder instead of leaf",

The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.  Update: I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't! Try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings.

Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.  Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.  The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.  The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.

As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. I'm sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.  The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.  This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products.

While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So.

What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.  \"Real\" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend \"time-to-mushiness.\")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.  You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the \"fruit flakes\"), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.  I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them. \n Summary: Nothing like actual Muesli",

I'll not buy them again unless Wrigley's returns to the original recipe. I guess they are saving a few cents by changing the recipe, but they are going to lose a whole lot of customers in my opinion.

In 13 of those cases, the pet died.\"  The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. \"Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,\" the directions say.  Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  \"These things tend to be wolfed down,\" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. \"They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

[NOTE, however, I was able to Live-Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a \"non-returnable grocery item\".] -- AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita-Coca(\"good\") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon. -- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve). -- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us). \n Summary: Review of Amazon-Shipping=2; But O.N.E.

After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.

For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list \"color (blue 1)\" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.  July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color \"blue 1\", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever! \n Summary: Another good product degraded",

They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.  This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.  If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).  Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.  However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED). \n Summary: Fun \"popping-crispy\" sticks dipped in chocolate, special treat for manga fans, but find local or wait till fall",

Here they are:  INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)  Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.  So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?  Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.  I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.  In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.

Normally, that would add up to a five-star meal. The problem is, our cat won't eat the stuff! Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different.

I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.  In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe. \n Summary: YUCK!",

            "input": "UPDATE: April 3, 2009 I \"ordered\" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: \"A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE.\" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be \"healthy.\" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.  As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The \"diet\" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of \"off the diet.\"  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a \"wolf in lamb's clothing\" for those who consider themselves \"heath conscious.\"  The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:  \"The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]\"  Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas: Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml) Servings [per can]: 1 Total Fat: 0g  0% DV Sodium: 15mg  1% DV Total Carb: 34g  11% DV  SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g Protein: 0g  0% DV  Then separately listed: Vitamin C: 100%  There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.  Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as \"Carb\" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.  As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR): Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).  Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].  Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.  That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.  But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!? \n Summary: way too sweet",

Pros: Reduced spit-up and gas Reduced fussiness Easy to mix up  Cons: Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digest  You can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website.

I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars. \n Summary: You have to be really desperate",

With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.

I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients. \n Summary: A+",

A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.  The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.  A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop.

I am guessing that some of the sweeters that I am quasi-allergic to are in here as well.  Basically this product is misleading, tastes gross, and can probably cause bad reactions in many people that don't react well to the loads of caffeine and lots of other artificial ingredients listed in the ingredients list.

If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.

I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!  The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.  I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.

I was fairly impressed with their prompt response to my concerns.  I hope they will fix the incorrect pricing info & start doing \"unit pricing\" on grocery items. \n Summary: Call quality control!

            "input": "For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.  Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.  I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.  If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list. \n Summary: Beautiful presentation ...and a pretty good tea too!",

Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...] \n Summary: Dogswell Happy Hips - Made in China",

I found the quality just like Patrick said. I too think it \"feels almost fragile;\" And, \"I also used...a mic cable\" because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because I didn't really need it to move it. So, I mounted the connection to my desk; And now I move it very little. Aside from the \"no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it,\" on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. That would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. Hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put.

They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific. I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$.

We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.  The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY\">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).

Also, the Amazon description said it was made from \"Non-Genetically Modified Corn\". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say \"made with\" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the \"Daily Value\" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice \"out\" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: \"Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.\" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO \"READ LABELS\" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.  I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:  * because I don't need extra calcium  * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health   but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands   and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn  and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.  I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.  *Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster! \n Summary: THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED.

This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...  This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker: After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.  Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies. \n Summary: better than average, more expensive than average.",

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.  -Taste  +Unsweetened: ++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring. ++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down *I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.  -Sweetened ++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor. ++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.  -2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.  Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.  I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

They are, hands down, the best store-bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new brand that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).  These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of \"new recipe\" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and \"soft baked\" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.  In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).  I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.

About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same... \n Summary: They changed the Chips now they taste horrible",

            "input": "I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.  Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.  So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as \"gluten intolerance\"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies. \n Summary: Find another treat",

            "input": "My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.  I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.  What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar \"heaviness\" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.  I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.  It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.  In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.  5 stars. \n Summary: Excellent Soda Alternative!",

I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3\" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7\"+ wide.  I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was \"BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD\"). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.  It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.  2 stars for responsiveness. \n Summary: do not buy!",

Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills.

Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)  Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash.

Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly.

Wrong.  About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green.  I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash.  Terrible product and I will never be buying these again.  As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.  I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again. \n Summary: Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.",

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.

Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS - BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets. ---- It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.  I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.  I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'  All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members. \n Summary: Packaging was already open!!!",

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.  The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.

Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas. \n Summary: Not So Bold Soda Alternative",

I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below. They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that. They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for  But: They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs. They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.  Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.  I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one.

After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.  CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.  PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.  Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.  Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them. \n Summary: too hard, more like small bricks",

If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings.

Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of \"Switch,\" probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.  The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at \"carbonation\" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as \"carbonated\" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.

At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds. I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste. Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the \"Switch\" carbonated fruit juice drinks. Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also.

I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little \"twigs\" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's \"standing\" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.)

This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.

She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.  Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.  I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :  \"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"  They ended their response with this condescending comment :  \"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"  After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The \"Canidae Team\" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.  So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.  I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs? \n Summary: Canidae Dog Food made my dogs extremely ill",

I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...\"I thought you said 5 stars.\"  It gets better.)  Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.  Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking! \n Summary: Fantastic taste and good for you!",

I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you don't care about the dirt.  Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.  Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.  Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.  I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy. \n Summary: Not as pictured AT ALL.

Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.

I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.  Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.) Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)  I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.

I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled.

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.  Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.  When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.  Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better. \n Summary: High Quality... But it gave my dog wicked gas..",

They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing \"straw grabber\" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent.

These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate  Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.  Crystal Light \"Natural\" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.  \"Natural\" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, \"natural\" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does \"taste\" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.  Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.  Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.  Cherry Pomegranate: ditto  My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical.

We love the size of this treat, it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.  We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.  We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.  You'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.  It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends, spread the joy of Liver Biscotti! \n Summary: Liver Biscotti rules in our house",

On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.  I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem. \n Summary: Bad batch made my dog sick",

I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!  The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up). \n Summary: Love the Earth's Best brand usually, but...",
