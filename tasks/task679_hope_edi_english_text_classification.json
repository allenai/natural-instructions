Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems.

I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video.
