This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems.

So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.
