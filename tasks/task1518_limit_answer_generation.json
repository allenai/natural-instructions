    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a sentence which contains a motion and your task is to identify the physical entities involved in the motion. The input sentence can have more than one entity and also there is at least one entity that takes part in physical motion. There are two types of entities which are animate (beings that are alive) and inanimate entities (beings that are not alive).",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Mr. Miller waved his hands in a gesture of divine despair, spun round, darted up the aisle, turned, and bounded back.",
            "output": "Mr. Miller, hands",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, the female is performing a motion on the liquids. So the answer should be Yes. Mr. Miller is the animate entity who is taking part in a motion where he is performing various actions like moving his hands around. The hands are the inanimate entity on which a motion is performed. This is the example where multiple entities are involved and are separated by commas."
        },
        {
            "input": "She snatched the photograph away, cast one glance at the languishing brown eyes, and tumbled it, face downward, into a bureau drawer.",
            "output": "She, the photograph",
            "explanation": "The motion here is performed by 'She' as the person performs an action on the inanimate object photograph. This is the example where multiple entities are involved and are separated by commas."
        },
        {
            "input": " A young man takes pictures of artistic ice sculptures, while a person carves a piece of ice in the street.",
            "output": "person",
            "explanation": "The motion is performed by a person but not A young man because A young man is still and does not require motion while taking pictures and there is no movement involved whereas a person is performing an action that requires movement."
        },
        {
            "input": " The person then pushes the fruit around the bowl with a spoon over and over again.",
            "output": "person, fruit, spoon",
            "explanation": "Based on the sentence given the person is the animate entity who is performing an action on the fruit which is present in the bowl. So effectively the person is pushing the bowl along with the fruit in it. The person is using an inanimate object which is a spoon to perform the motion."

            "output": "The God of Luck",
            "explanation": "The answer is wrong because The God of luck is a fictive personality and not a real person performing the motion. The God of Luck is being imagined by the entities in the sentence."
