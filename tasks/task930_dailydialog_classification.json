Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together .  So the bill is $ 36.00 .  How much do you think we should leave for a tip ?  My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip .  I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control .  Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service .  I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . ",
