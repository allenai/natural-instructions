    "Definition": [
        "You are given two sentences. You have to find if there is entailment or agreement of the Hypothesis by the Premise. From the given pair of sentences, you should identify if there is enough information in the Premise to support the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise may not exactly be the same as Hypothesis. Your task is to return 'entails' if the premise supports hypothesis else return 'neutral'."

            "output": "entails",
            "explanation": "The premise sentence agrees with the hypothesis that Lyme Disease is a bacterium. The premise also gives additional information about Lyme disease. Therefore Premise entails Hypothesis."

            "input": "Premise: Corolla Collective term for all the petals of a flower, these petals may be separate or fused together. \n Hypothesis: All of the petals together are called a corolla.",
            "output": "entails",
            "explanation": "The premise sentence explains the meaning of Corolla. The hypothesis sentence is explained by the Premise. Since the premise supports/entails the Hypothesis, this is classified as entails."

            "input": "Premise: The liver is divided into the right lobe and left lobes. \n Hypothesis: The gallbladder is near the right lobe of the liver.",
            "output": "neutral",
            "explanation": "The premise states about the general structure of the liver while the hypothesis is explaining about a specific part of the liver. Therefore this premise does not support the hypothesis and hence classified as neutral."

            "explanation": "The premise does not have a fact that can be supported. It is a task that should be carried out to find the pH of the substances. The hypothesis is therefore not supported by the premise. It should be classified as neutral not as entails."
