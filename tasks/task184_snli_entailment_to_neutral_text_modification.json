    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that agree with each other. Your job is to alter sentence 2 so that the pair neither agree nor contradict each other. Generated sentences must be short, with less than 15 words. New information can be introduced. Avoid using pronouns to confuse the subject of the sentence.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sentence 1: Jon saw his friend Tom coming out of the grocery store with a bag of fruit. Sentence 2: Tom had been shopping in the store.",
            "output": "Tom had been shopping for fruit to give Jon.",
            "explanation": "The given sentence is a good alteration. If the changed sentence was something like: \"Tom had been sleeping in his house in that time\", it'd contradict the first sentence. But this given sentence neither agrees with the first sentence, nor contradicts it."

        {
            "input": "Sentence 1: The girl transferred all the flowers from the boquet to a vase. Sentence 2: The vase was big enough to hold all the flowers.",
            "output": "The flowers will soon wither.",
            "explanation": "Since it is not known if the flowers are real or not, the given sentence doesn't contradict the first sentence, so it's a good alteration."

            "input": "Sentence 1: The skier was on the edge of the ramp. Sentence 2: The skier was about to begin skiing.",
            "output": "The skier was participating in a competition.",
            "explanation": "It is not known if the skier was skiing recreationally or competitively, so the given sentence and sentence 1 neither agree with each other, nor contradict each other."

            "input": "Sentence 1: Joyce likes to eat fruit salad. Sentence 2: She makes fruit salad every week.",
            "output": "Joyce gets her fruits from her garden.",
            "explanation": "Joyce's source of fruits is not known, so the given sentence doesn't contradict the sentence 1 and it also doesn't agree with it."
