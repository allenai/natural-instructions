            "output": "Tom had been shopping for fruit to give Jon.",
            "explanation": "The given sentence is a good alteration. If the changed sentence was something like: \"Tom had been sleeping in his house in that time\", it'd contradict the first sentence. But this given sentence neither agrees with the first sentence, nor contradicts it."

            "output": "The flowers will soon wither.",
            "explanation": "Since it is not known if the flowers are real or not, the given sentence doesn't contradict the first sentence, so it's a good alteration."
