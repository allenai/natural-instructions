A party that Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt or even, dare I say it, Richard Nixon could be proud of.  You can be all those things and still advocate for a bootstrapping, small government, low tax agenda. Hawaii WOULD be better if those arguments were cogently made in our legislature.  But the GOP of today is abject in its subservience to corporate and theocratic interests, spiteful in its embrace of racism and misogyny, and wicked in its willful rejection of science – wicked because in refusing to act on climate change it threatens all humanity.  There are progressive Republicans like Rep. Cynthia Thielen, but the recent history has been that the tea baggers who run the Hawaii GOP have been chasing decent Republicans away.",

Thus it could be argued that the Fed would do better to adhere closely to the Taylor rule in their setting of the nominal interest rate. While we can't say for sure if we're in a housing bubble, one way to gauge the real value of housing is to compare it with long-term inflation. U.S. median family home prices are currently overvalued at around 30% above the long-term inflationary trend. This coupled with the fed funds rate near the 1% low which former Fed chairman Allan Greenspan set it, which triggered the housing bubble of 2005, could very well mean we're in the thick of another housing bubble. Do I hear trillion dollar government bailout of the big banks?",

If he saw a woman approaching on the street, he learned to automatically lower his eyes to the ground. Being the sexual creatures we are, of course we are going to notice each other; and yes, men and women like to be complimented on how they look; however, if how they dress over emphasizes their sexuality, some of us need to draw the line and bypass the compliments.

The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments.\" The Bible, like the Quran, is full of the relics of bad theology. God by definition cannot have a \"change of heart,\" but clearly over the span of time the Bible was written, less so for the Quran (which is puzzling, given its many conflicting commands toward peace and Jihad), the people's understanding of their God changed.

The disciples were ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit more than two years before Pentecost when they received additional power.\n\nI used to teach gifts discovery classes but quit because of the extreme failure rate.

Sure that would have been \"better\" in terms of meting out self-congratulatory relativistic moral judgement - all I can say is it must be nice to always live in a world, where the choices are always so black and white, and others deserve every misery they get when they act without such absolute virtue.

If your child wants to dress as a Disney character do so appropriately. If your college, high school, or adult self wants to dress as moana DO SO APPROPRIATELY. The issue is when you dress up as another culture but 'sexy'. This misrepresents the culture and is offensive.

It has been reported that his girlfriend is the senior lobbyist for the Airlines For America (A4A), an anti-consumer airline trade group that colludes to maximize industry profits. They have long wanted to control the ATC system to their benefit and Shuster proposes they control a new ATC board of directors. Very bad for general aviation, which would assume a large burden of the system taxes they would certainly shift away from themselves.

I chose principal and interest payments. -Then- In '2015' it was suggested that I take out a mortgage for the residual amount owing on the HELC at 2.24% ; continue paying principal and interest, and save approximately $16 K in interest . -Now- I was informed that I could borrow against the increasing HELC credit portion available but at 3.7% interest rate. -Although- The rate was better than a unsecured/ secured L/C, I have not now nor ever intend to do so. -And- When the mortgage comes up for renewal in '2018', if the rate is not better than 2.24%; i.e. if the rates go up, I can always convert it back to the HELC at the fixed at 3.7% at no cost.

This may be beneficial to the victims since it does not identify why the cases are so classified, thereby protecting the victim from scrutiny.\n\nI foresee as a result of this story that the police may redefine unfounded claims as one or more of the following categories;\n\n-insufficient evidence\n-inconclusive evidence\n-questionable evidence\n-victim unwillingness/inability to provide evidence\n\nWill this be better? I doubt it.\n\nWhatever they do the results will likely not lead to any more charges or convictions. For that to happen laws must be changed to make offenders guilty until proven innocent.",

Hearsay is an out of court statement, made in court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing in question and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated. For example, Witness A in a murder trial claimed on the stand: \"Witness B (the \"declarant\") told me that the defendant killed the victim.\" The definition of hearsay is not too difficult to understand.

The Sioux have accepted the treaty terms for that last 148 years. I would say that kind of trumps your argument, (pun intended). The treaty ;problems are with the Treaty of 1877 that was done without the consent of the Sioux as required by the Treaty  of 1868. It also broke up the one big reservation into several smaller reservations and took away the Black Hills, but the Sioux, rightfully, have never accepted the Treaty of 1877. I think they never should accept the Treaty of 1877. However, in every case, the northern boundary is the Cannon Ball River, still well south of the pipeline due to an executive order in 1873 moving the boundary north.",

There are far too many stories of officers using 50, 60, 70 shots to neutralize a target, who sometimes is shown not to be armed at all.   There are stories of policemen watching a wounded person bleed to death on the floor of the station without summoning help.  And then, our police patrol city streets looking like stormtroopers--armored, heavily armed with automatic weapons, backed up by light tanks.  Does Van Brocklin think all this has nothing to do with why Americans, especially minority and poor5 Americans, feel the police are an occupying force without moral legitimacy?",

The shift wasn't merely a change in volume, but towards a form of transportation that demanded, by its nature, near-exclusive use of the right-of-way; needed unprecedented investments in infrastructure to be viable; and which, as mentioned, resulted in ballooning maintenance costs.\n\nAlso, I think you underestimate the volume of traffic before the advent of cars. Congestion was an urban issue long before the Industrial Revolution. Urbanization pre-automobile made it worse. A busy NYC street in 1903, for instance, likely contained more people than could fit on a modern roadway, since single-occupancy vehicles make inefficient use of space.\n\nThe bottom line is cars cost the public in unique ways; gas taxes and motor vehicle fees were initiated in a conscious acknowledgment of that. Bikes weren't omitted as an oversight.",

With a game that Saturday, Ballard was forced to re-hire him and tried to get Roger to come out with a paper bag on his head.\n\nBallard was The Donald long before Trump.  Just check out the famous interview of Ballard by CBC's Barbara Frum (just google \"Barbara Frum vs. Harold Ballard CBC\")  The night after the interviewt, Frum reads a letter on-air to Ballard forgiving him for his sexist outbursts. She signs the \"Dear Harold\" letter from \"Your favourite BROAD-caster.\"  And his response?  Harold Ballard told the media that \"ugly women\" give him headaches.  Sound familar?",

This is because she traveled with him and the 12 constantly.\n\nYou need to take on a gentler tone with people Trad.

I don't think there is a single reason for this. \n\nAlthough child sexual abuse (CSA) is and has been a widespread phenomenon both culturally and historically, civil society did not deal with it comprehensively until very recently either. \n\nThe age to marry in the RCC according to CCL has been 14 for the longest time. So sexual contact with people fifteen and up could have been explained away as sexual misconduct/sin, and not abuse, that could be fixed by spiritual means (confession, prayer, etc). Remember,  the overwhelming cases of abuse involved postpubertal individuals.\n\nEvery institution has a basic reflex to protect itself. Add to this the fear and disdain of scandal in the RCC, and the high regard for the secrecy of the confessional, and you have a strong incentive to keep things private or secret.\n\nThese are just a few reasons, but none of this justifies anything. But it is worth considering them.",

And it shouldn't happen, just as it shouldn't in a case where LGBTQ interests as well as the legitimate right of LGBTQ citizens/residents to be protected from discrimination are at stake. This is not about special interests. It's about the right of people from a historically oppressed community to be able to protect themselves from discrimination.

In fact, I suggest that you read the articles you reference because it seems you haven't.    I quoted David Schmitt (above) with regard to his comments on the \"Google Manifesto\".   In his comments he clearly states that:  \"\"But it is not clear to me how such sex differences are relevant to the Google workplace...\" \"the size of these negative emotion sex differences is not very large.. ..accounting for less than 10% of the variance\".\n\nFurther the link to Schmitt's article above just is just the abstract.   But even that raises more questions.  For example:   he states:  \"Empirically, sex differences in most psychological traits—in personality, sexuality, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and cognitive abilities—are conspicuously larger in cultures with more egalitarian sex role socialization and greater sociopolitical gender equity.\"",

In sum, the sad reality is that the values they should have learned during their formative years, that is from birth to 8 years old and thereafter, from their parents and social institutions like kindergarten, grade school, junior high school, and high school, were taken from them, sometimes by our own public officials in the guise of \"separation of church and state.\" Faith-based organizations and churches have to be involved in order to contribute to the education of our children. Otherwise, when these 15 to 17 year-old teens grow-up to become adults, they have nothing to restrain them such as self-control, self-discipline, knowledge of right and wrong, knowledge of good and evil, and understanding of what is lawful and what is reckless lawlessness.Compassionate intervention is needed. *",

That's too simplified for me, based on the amount of men and women that have been reported to be assaulted on college campuses alone in studies. Rape does happen and often victims do not get justice There is also an issue that training is not properly done in these settings. My friend in BC worked in corrections and there is not an emphasis on appropriate conduct. In fact she found the inmates to be a relief compared to the STAFF she had to work with. The point is is that there aren't ways for police to determine if rape cases are true or false often. There needs to be a better method than he said she said. If bias gets in the way eliminate that and create more objective methods.",

That is, he must not believe the members and leadership of Imago Dei hate or mistreat women and they don't fear or mistreat homosexuals. What if this is actually true? The progressive community is now far too exclusive and refuses to hear the opinions and perspectives of people it disagrees with. Its group think. And...fear. \n\nLet the man believe what he wants, and worship where he will. What a majority on here are saying is that he's a viable candidate except he hangs out with undesirables...people who believe (peacefully, without controversy) counter to the majority.

Which have been reluctant to help with social and cooperative and rental housing, and even if they talk favorably, its often more words than action. \n\nAnd we should never ever not give some of the credit for the diseaster that is home ownership and rental and social housing in Vancouver from real estate and development corporations, and ordinary citizens who saw dollar signs in their eyes when they discovered the home they bought in the 80s for $50,000 is can sell for a million.",

Raven has complete control over the relationship between herself and Strat - every moment of physical contact between them is initiated by her. When she expresses any moment of sadness or doubt, Strat gives her huge amounts of physical space and waits to be invited back in. I applaud this show for giving audiences a very important social lesson in how the sexy rebel boy is even sexier when he asks permission, pays attention to his potential lover's queues, and does nothing without enthusiastic consent. Throughout the show, female-presenting characters (Raven, Zahara, Sloane) are given agency to turn down unwanted sexual advances.\n\nI think you missed something.",

In 1996, with the presidency of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian economy flailing, President Clinton endorsed a $10.2-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund linked to privatization, trade liberalization and other measures that would move Russia toward a capitalist economy. Yeltsin used the loan to bolster his popular support, telling voters that only he had the reformist credentials to secure such loans, according to media reports at the time. He used the money, in part, for social spending before the election, including payment of back wages and pensions.",

For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.  I cited, briefly, one example of the current Secretary's success.  Ask the caseworkers locally at the St. Vincent de Paul Society who are working with VA to get homeless Veterans and their families off the streets.

The fact that their pension is based on best 5 years where those with RRSP's or defined contributions simply have a savings plan with no link to matching their best 5 years is simply unfair. You should know this, you're a pension expert. So when I have worked for 6 different employers (always employed, never missed a pay cheque) but have only accumulated enough in my RRSP to cover 15% of my best 5 years I say \"not fair\" that my taxes go to pay a benefit I could never dream of receiving myself. I think everyone in Canada, based on their own initiative should have a way of sheltering income for retirement similar to what we pay our public servants. It will cost the treasury a fortune, but its only fair!!",

No insurance companies have gone bankrupt as a result. \n\nApproximately 91% of Canadians polled feel that insurance companies should not be allowed access to their genetic information for an insurance assessment. Further, 90% of Canadians opposed the notion that employers should have access to the genetic information of workers or job applicants.\n\nWe all know that corporations control our MPs through their 'political donations', but it's a little much to have the Prime Minister so cravenly demonstrating where his allegiance lies.

Having not taught their daughter accountability and respect, she is unable to demand it of others. \n\nAs to what advice to give, that would depend on whether the parents - even at this late stage - are prepared to grow a spine. If the mother is also half-owner of the house, she could insist on selling it off.

Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. The plan of universal healthcare activists is to convince President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to transfer all the Medi-Cal billions to help leftist California finance a single-payer system, something they’d fear and deride as socialized medicine. The committee analysis assumed a 15% payroll tax on income. This in a state that already suffers from the highest income tax rates in the nation. But if all this happened, there’d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There’d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles — and therefore no self controls.

Supporting gun controls, the Affordable Care Act, and the Clean Air Act have nothing to do with including women in the political process and informing them about issues and candidates, nor does abolishing the death penalty or opposing school vouchers, welfare reform, or the Keystone Pipeline.

It's a delicate balance which generally isn't explored too deeply here in the West for fear of raising uncomfortable discussions regarding the reform of Islam and its ties to political realities. \n\nMs Yousafzai argues that gender equality and commitment to universal education are not incompatible with Islam and that reform is best served as a movement from within Islam itself based upon Islamic teaching, that advancement for women within Islam is more about reclamation than reformation , while others such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali see equality as an outgrowth of Islamic reform as emanating from outside the faith, forcing change...,\n\nit's an important question, generally too problematic for western media and politicians, who prefer to view Ms Yousafzai for the most part through a lens focused only upon gender equality.",

It enabled states to assume criminal, as well as civil, jurisdiction in matters involving Indians as litigants on reservation land. Previous to the enactment of Public Law 280, these matters were dealt with in either tribal and/or federal court.\"\n\nStates : \"Enumerated in Public Law 280 were six states which were obligated to assume jurisdiction from the outset of the law: Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin. States that have assumed at least some jurisdiction since the enactment of Public Law 280 include: Nevada, South Dakota, Washington, Florida, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, Iowa, and Utah.\" (Note: Metlakatla in Alaska retained rights)\n\n*States can opt out of PL280.\n*ICWA 1978 All states",

OTOH, the 2.0 was tested at 2.0 and not tested at 3.0. Yet, 99% of them will run at 3.0 JUST FINE. But you paid say $150 for the 2.0 OR you would have paid $500 for the 3.0. What is difference? Just the speed at which they ran the EXACT SAME TEST. \nThis is true on YOUR PHONE. On any laptop, etc.  How do you obtain the faster speed? By changing the software. This is just 1 example of this. \n\n2) Tesla sold you a car with a set amount of charge capabilities. At the same time, they TOLD YOU that at any time, if you want, you can pay extra and the software will upgrade it. So, what do you care if somebody pays for the extra miles / charge? As it is, tesla's profit margins are low on the 60 due to this.",

This new footage with audio, the rationales discussed in the press conference, and the cover up of shots by the FBI all give me greater concern, not less.\n\nIt is clearly possible the police may have designed this situation to provoke an opportunity to shoot at least one of the high profile protesters to dissuade others from staging similar protests in the future.

I doubt Francis will ditch his fellow Jesuit's brilliant work for \"Lutheran sacraments or ordinations\" or for Luther's two Catechisms (never seriously taken as works of academic theology). I am sure, too, Luther's understanding of the role of the \"godly prince,\" which effectively insisted that a monarch had total control of the church, would not sit well with him (as it didn't sit well with republican Calvin).

A tree that falls and rots stores some carbon in the soil, but most is released to the atmosphere. When trees operate in a system, forests are great carbon sinks, no doubt, but I think you're overestimating the value of a small patch of trees here that are not part of a larger forest system ... trees that are apparently getting knocked down by storms and probably rotting, based on other comments here.

How the Post can be advocating sticking to such a lackluster series of policies and people is beyond me. If you want kids who can't read and charter chains making money hand over fist, feel free to support the Post's recommended candidates. If, however, you want a Board who will really listen to the needs and concerns of parents and communities, vote for Tay Anderson (District 4), Robert Speth (At Large), Carrie Olson (District 3) and Sochi Gaitan (District 2).",

In both cases, black witnesses flat out lied about what they saw and heard. Were the liars ever prosecuted for filing a false report or for perjury in court? Nope.\n\nKaepernick can take his \"protest\" and \"raise the awareness\" of somebody who believes all that black BS and gives a damn.

Unfortunately, it's not unusual, in all parts of the country.  I was in high school teaching for four years in California. Left as soon as I could, partly for the lack of support from local school board and community.  Fortunately, the National Science Foundation paid me to get my M.S. degree in Chemistry with all fees covered. I quickly moved on to an outstanding community college at one of the highest paying colleges in the country.  The respect from community, administration, and students was the difference between night and day.  \n\nBy having decent salaries and benefits, Eugene is able to attract the better teachers from all parts of the country.  Consider this (baby sitting wages): $10 an hour per student times 35 students equals $350 per class.  Five classes at $1750 a day times 190 days equals $332,500 per year.  $103,000 a year is a bargain!",

Currently the largest portion of Medicare is funded by federal income taxes which are very reflective of a progressive tax structure already. \n\nBut it is not just some will pay more and some less, some will receive less coverage and some more. These differences should be stated openly and honestly.\n\nIf children are currently covered by a private employer sponsored health plan than the company supplied premiums and the employee supplied premiums are funding the children's coverage. If \"Medicare for All\" is funded by increased taxes for the employer and increased taxes for the employee that seems to leave a gap for all dependent care coverage. The funds to cover dependents will need to come from somewhere.\n\nAgain state honestly and succinctly how is coverage changing and from whom and how is the funding being generated.

First off, I have a tremendous amount of empathy for my fellow human beings who are facing a profound upheaval in their lives. However, I have experience with family members who have lived in hotels like this off of Broadway. Lowering or subsidizing their rent will not help the problem in the long term. It temporarily puts off the inevitable future catastrophe. Without changing life habits and mindsets, these folks will just shuffle off to the next tenuous living situation. In my experience about a third of the people in this type of living arrangement are open to changing their lives. My family member was part of the 2/3 who aren't. I'm not judging, but this person was simply not ready to \"move up\" unless it was given to them. In this person's case, drugs were the reason, but spending time around these types of hotels, drugs aren't the only deciding factor. I used to eat at the restaurant across from the King's Inn.

True, there are some gay wags who say they love practicing their homosexuality, because \"practice makes perfect,\" but that's something else.\n\nWhat the objection of conservative Christian authorities to \"the practice of homosexuality\" sounds like is no less than that they wish all LGBTQI people would stay secure and gagged in their closets, forever.

In the present instance, the purchase and use of cigarettes by the younger population does not significantly impact the safety or rights of the general population.  Therefore this restriction on freedom does not conform to good democratic practice.  The dangers of second hand smoke are addressed by other laws prohibiting smoking in various places.

We were hopeful as he did very well with Chip's players and scheme, but it went downhill as they graduated and were not replaced with players of the same caliber, particularly at quarterback.  Defensive recruiting and coaching also suffered after Alioti left and was replaced in-house.  This year, inexperience and his bad play calling cost us games that we had to win, and losing created a downward spiral.  Helfrich is a wonderful person, but he just did not cut it as coach, on the field, staffing or recruiting, and it could be seen coming for more than a year.

First, it requires a significant number of petition signatures to qualify for the ballot.  Secondly, it requires a majority of voters to support its adoption. Thirdly, it,like all ordinances, would be subject to judicial review.  At each step proponents must make a convincing argument that the measure is a) constitutional and b) desirable.

Hardly \"hard data\" to make a policy decision off of, but perhaps useful for rookie teachers looking for work, maybe.  Just having starting and average salaries doesn't tell you the whole story. Averages can be skewed by very  high/low earners, a more useful number is median salary.

You are required to have LIABILITY insurance as a condition of being granted a driver's license. This protects other motorists and your own assets. (Insurance on the vehicle is usually a condition of borrowing the money to buy the car. This protects the lien holder, no one else, although it's prudent to protect your own assets.) \n\nTo apply the parallel to health coverage, you would require insurance as a condition of being alive. This is unique in the entire economy. (Never mind that you have the option of paying for your health care by numerous other means.)\n\nHuge distinction.\n\nWhile it's a wise purchase -- like auto or homeowners insurance -- health insurance doesn't necessarily protect anyone else. If your interest is enforcing responsibility -- as defined by whom, by the way? -- one is simply liable for his own bills. That requires no mandate or enforcement by the state over a private transaction.",

I would also only expand Medicare to cover the poor with certain chronic conditions and disabilities (including mental and addictions), children, and the working poor or those on unemployment.

The failure to do so has given the public the impression that Secretary Clinton and her associates received special treatment,” Sen. Grassley said in the letter.",

Most people who aren't as lucky also strive to improve their lot and society has never provided the level of opportunity to do so than exists today. Upward mobility exists to a far greater extent for those who were not born within the '1 %'.",
