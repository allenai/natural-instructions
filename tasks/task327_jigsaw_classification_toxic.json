A party that Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt or even, dare I say it, Richard Nixon could be proud of.  You can be all those things and still advocate for a bootstrapping, small government, low tax agenda. Hawaii WOULD be better if those arguments were cogently made in our legislature.  But the GOP of today is abject in its subservience to corporate and theocratic interests, spiteful in its embrace of racism and misogyny, and wicked in its willful rejection of science – wicked because in refusing to act on climate change it threatens all humanity.  There are progressive Republicans like Rep. Cynthia Thielen, but the recent history has been that the tea baggers who run the Hawaii GOP have been chasing decent Republicans away.",

Thus it could be argued that the Fed would do better to adhere closely to the Taylor rule in their setting of the nominal interest rate. While we can't say for sure if we're in a housing bubble, one way to gauge the real value of housing is to compare it with long-term inflation. U.S. median family home prices are currently overvalued at around 30% above the long-term inflationary trend. This coupled with the fed funds rate near the 1% low which former Fed chairman Allan Greenspan set it, which triggered the housing bubble of 2005, could very well mean we're in the thick of another housing bubble. Do I hear trillion dollar government bailout of the big banks?",

I suppose they'll improve on this, but it just underlines the obvious. The Habs are not a very good offensive team. And they keep messing around with one of their two most skilled players i.e. Galchenyuk.

If he saw a woman approaching on the street, he learned to automatically lower his eyes to the ground. Being the sexual creatures we are, of course we are going to notice each other; and yes, men and women like to be complimented on how they look; however, if how they dress over emphasizes their sexuality, some of us need to draw the line and bypass the compliments.

This Republican tax bill just raises the debt by 1.5 trillion dollars and does nothing for average people.\n\nMaybe $500k mortgage interest deduction does not impact a lot of people now. But lets look at reality. The AMT tax impacted very few people when it was introduced. But it now impacts much of the middle class due to inflation. So don't believe the lies that this corrupt Congress is pushing. Most of the middle class will be paying a lot higher taxes in eight years if this lame bill passes.\n\nAnd that higher standard deduction is a joke for families. You pay more in taxes as soon as you have three or more children because the Republicans take away the deduction for dependents.\n\nThe Democrats are stupid and Republicans are stupid as well. The reason why China may be leading the world in another decade is because our government cannot get its act together.",

The problem for the Catholic Church, as with Judaism and Islam, was called out for the world to see in the Diet of Worms in 1521 by Johann Eck, assistant to the Archbishop of Trier and spokesman for Emperor Charles V, when he addressed Martin Luther:  'there is no one of the heresies which have torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various interpretation of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments.\" The Bible, like the Quran, is full of the relics of bad theology. God by definition cannot have a \"change of heart,\" but clearly over the span of time the Bible was written, less so for the Quran (which is puzzling, given its many conflicting commands toward peace and Jihad), the people's understanding of their God changed.  Unfortunately, the Church left these relics in place.",

And courts would be backed up. I am only citing things that were done in the past. There were some wins, geographical restrictions was great for me as a watch commander in China town. Yup moved problem but I was also realistic about what the police department  and my officers could do. Restrictions was a temporary solution but it brought together the Chinatown Neighborhood board, the Honolulu Prosecutors, and the Courts, community policing.

If your child wants to dress as a Disney character do so appropriately. If your college, high school, or adult self wants to dress as moana DO SO APPROPRIATELY. The issue is when you dress up as another culture but 'sexy'. This misrepresents the culture and is offensive. Take accountability for your actions and recognize when something you want to do is offensive and harmful towards another race.

It has been reported that his girlfriend is the senior lobbyist for the Airlines For America (A4A), an anti-consumer airline trade group that colludes to maximize industry profits. They have long wanted to control the ATC system to their benefit and Shuster proposes they control a new ATC board of directors. Very bad for general aviation, which would assume a large burden of the system taxes they would certainly shift away from themselves. The airlines cannot be trusted- what is good for them, is not good for American or global travelers. Leave the crown jewel of the FAA intact.",

And today it feels more telling than ever.  I'm not saying they should not vote, just that age and experience (as we now see as a new trend in the\nwork force) speak loud and clear and should be hailed, as it often is in other cultures, as\nsomething to look to and learn from.  Youth will always take itself very seriously so no\nchance we will miss that part.  But older people often feel harassed for simply having a lot\nof years behind them.  This scorning of the older voter is shameful.",

So of Course the British did not want the Colonists at the Penal Colonies to have Firearms, Security  was provided by British Military that were previously disgraced and or previously imprisoned also.  During the American Revolution the First thing that British General Cornwallis and British General Clinton did was to seize the Armories of the American Colonists' Militias.

I chose principal and interest payments. -Then- In '2015' it was suggested that I take out a mortgage for the residual amount owing on the HELC at 2.24% ; continue paying principal and interest, and save approximately $16 K in interest . -Now- I was informed that I could borrow against the increasing HELC credit portion available but at 3.7% interest rate. -Although- The rate was better than a unsecured/ secured L/C, I have not now nor ever intend to do so. -And- When the mortgage comes up for renewal in '2018', if the rate is not better than 2.24%; i.e. if the rates go up, I can always convert it back to the HELC at the fixed at 3.7% at no cost.

Hearsay is an out of court statement, made in court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing in question and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated. For example, Witness A in a murder trial claimed on the stand: \"Witness B (the \"declarant\") told me that the defendant killed the victim.\" The definition of hearsay is not too difficult to understand.

The Sioux have accepted the treaty terms for that last 148 years. I would say that kind of trumps your argument, (pun intended). The treaty ;problems are with the Treaty of 1877 that was done without the consent of the Sioux as required by the Treaty  of 1868. It also broke up the one big reservation into several smaller reservations and took away the Black Hills, but the Sioux, rightfully, have never accepted the Treaty of 1877. I think they never should accept the Treaty of 1877. However, in every case, the northern boundary is the Cannon Ball River, still well south of the pipeline due to an executive order in 1873 moving the boundary north.",

And when you factor in retirees with a small fixed income, kids, housewives, the underemployed, unemployed and the whopping 10% of Honolulu's population earning less than federal poverty levels and the swaths of bums the only real population with any with earning potential to pay for it all is probably closer to 500k residents.

There are stories of policemen watching a wounded person bleed to death on the floor of the station without summoning help.  And then, our police patrol city streets looking like stormtroopers--armored, heavily armed with automatic weapons, backed up by light tanks.

Congestion was an urban issue long before the Industrial Revolution. Urbanization pre-automobile made it worse. A busy NYC street in 1903, for instance, likely contained more people than could fit on a modern roadway, since single-occupancy vehicles make inefficient use of space.\n\nThe bottom line is cars cost the public in unique ways; gas taxes and motor vehicle fees were initiated in a conscious acknowledgment of that.

The Similarities between Trump and Ballard are quite remarkable - even leaving aside the hair styles.\n\nRemember when Prince Hal (the guy with the prematurely orange hair) fired Roger Neilson as the Leafs coach  but then couldn't find a replacement. With a game that Saturday, Ballard was forced to re-hire him and tried to get Roger to come out with a paper bag on his head.\n\nBallard was The Donald long before Trump.  Just check out the famous interview of Ballard by CBC's Barbara Frum (just google \"Barbara Frum vs. Harold Ballard CBC\")  The night after the interviewt, Frum reads a letter on-air to Ballard forgiving him for his sexist outbursts. She signs the \"Dear Harold\" letter from \"Your favourite BROAD-caster.\"  And his response?  Harold Ballard told the media that \"ugly women\" give him headaches.  Sound familar?",

There is no concern for those in need of cheap safe pot for medicinal use and even less for the recreational user that prefer pot to booze. The goal is how do we keep people from growing their own so our friends with licenses can reap and share their bounty.\n\nSolution: Decriminalize it and allow those that want to grow their own limited to personal consumption. Make them buy a local permit annually, fining violators. This would replace some of the tax revenue from commercialization but it would leave the tax revenue in the local community were it could be used more effectively.

There's still no real City-led plan that includes a livable, working, & commerce sustaining or attractive downtown.  There's little acknowlegdement of community as critical.  \"Not going backwards\" after 30 years of timber decline isn't the same as \"progress.\" And Sean Dunn is right, the City agenda is primarily led by (old) city managers.

I also pointed out what Jesus Christ taught regarding the ideas of temptation and that he held the individual who chose to lust responsible for his sin of concentrating on sex instead of God during worship or any other time.  Jesus did not tell men to push women away to protect their chastity nor did he push women away from himself.  Mary Magdalene was called at the time, Christ's constant companion.  This is because she traveled with him and the 12 constantly.\n\nYou need to take on a gentler tone with people Trad.  There is nothing wrong with people supporting their debate with scripture, Gospel & OT.  If Exodus supported what you claim, then you could cut and paste the scripture stating that clearly.  You can't do this because it is not in the scripture.\n\nIt is not my job to prove your argument - that is your job & you haven't.",

So sexual contact with people fifteen and up could have been explained away as sexual misconduct/sin, and not abuse, that could be fixed by spiritual means (confession, prayer, etc). Remember,  the overwhelming cases of abuse involved postpubertal individuals.\n\nEvery institution has a basic reflex to protect itself. Add to this the fear and disdain of scandal in the RCC, and the high regard for the secrecy of the confessional, and you have a strong incentive to keep things private or secret.\n\nThese are just a few reasons, but none of this justifies anything.

By deselecting LGBTQ intervenors in a case where LGBTQ rights and interests are fundamental to the matter at hand, the SCC's original position failed the test of objectivity. Imagine if the SCC were to hear and rule on an appeal application about a pipeline in northern Canada after deselecting intervenors representing aboriginal interests. It just wouldn't happen. And it shouldn't happen, just as it shouldn't in a case where LGBTQ interests as well as the legitimate right of LGBTQ citizens/residents to be protected from discrimination are at stake. This is not about special interests. It's about the right of people from a historically oppressed community to be able to protect themselves from discrimination. To shut them out of the process would have transformed the SCC into little more than a kangaroo court.",

In fact, I suggest that you read the articles you reference because it seems you haven't.    I quoted David Schmitt (above) with regard to his comments on the \"Google Manifesto\".   In his comments he clearly states that:  \"\"But it is not clear to me how such sex differences are relevant to the Google workplace...\" \"the size of these negative emotion sex differences is not very large.. ..accounting for less than 10% of the variance\".\n\nFurther the link to Schmitt's article above just is just the abstract.   But even that raises more questions.  For example:   he states:  \"Empirically, sex differences in most psychological traits—in personality, sexuality, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and cognitive abilities—are conspicuously larger in cultures with more egalitarian sex role socialization and greater sociopolitical gender equity.\"",

I always carry bear spray.  It is not that hard to co-exist with wildlife if you are situationally aware, know something about the behavior of our local wildlife, and try to avoid killing our non-human locals.  If you don't like living with wildlife, move to California, IMHO.  There are always some risks when living in Alaska.  This remains a unique and spectacular place to live!

Otherwise, when these 15 to 17 year-old teens grow-up to become adults, they have nothing to restrain them such as self-control, self-discipline, knowledge of right and wrong, knowledge of good and evil, and understanding of what is lawful and what is reckless lawlessness.Compassionate intervention is needed. *",

Rape does happen and often victims do not get justice There is also an issue that training is not properly done in these settings. My friend in BC worked in corrections and there is not an emphasis on appropriate conduct. In fact she found the inmates to be a relief compared to the STAFF she had to work with. The point is is that there aren't ways for police to determine if rape cases are true or false often. There needs to be a better method than he said she said.

But we do know that it was written most likely in Rome - therefore it presents a christology that is a backwards look in time.\n\nScholars believe the Book of Hebrews - very polished and eloquent - was written for Jewish Christians.  Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity - which eventually did become a major tenet in Christianity's priesthood cult.",

Sometimes school boards need to engage parents more than average when kids have special needs and this communication can help parents to better serve their children.  Nobody is talking about \"outing\" gay kids and neither is Mr. Kenney but there should not be a one size fit all solution here.  The decision should be left with school boards to determine whether it is appropriate to tell parents or not, if school boards suspect that children may be subjected to an abusive situation at home then school boards should reserve the right to withhold this information.  The schoolboards are the most qualified people to make this decision, though, not Ms. Notley and her authoritarian nanny state.",

The fundamental issue that has you and others here perplexed, is that though disagree as he does with his church on women in leadership and marriage equality Jules Bailey doesn't seem to think his fellow members are either misogynistic or homophobic. That is, he must not believe the members and leadership of Imago Dei hate or mistreat women and they don't fear or mistreat homosexuals. What if this is actually true? The progressive community is now far too exclusive and refuses to hear the opinions and perspectives of people it disagrees with. Its group think. And...fear. \n\nLet the man believe what he wants, and worship where he will. What a majority on here are saying is that he's a viable candidate except he hangs out with undesirables...people who believe (peacefully, without controversy) counter to the majority. This runs counter to self-purported progressive Portland values.",

Raven has complete control over the relationship between herself and Strat - every moment of physical contact between them is initiated by her. When she expresses any moment of sadness or doubt, Strat gives her huge amounts of physical space and waits to be invited back in. I applaud this show for giving audiences a very important social lesson in how the sexy rebel boy is even sexier when he asks permission, pays attention to his potential lover's queues, and does nothing without enthusiastic consent. Throughout the show, female-presenting characters (Raven, Zahara, Sloane) are given agency to turn down unwanted sexual advances.\n\nI think you missed something.",

Therefore, we have over two decades of economic statistics that show high immigration levels are directly correlated with worsening economics for middle to lower income earners (the majority). Also directly correlated with widening income gap, where the very wealthy get even wealthier.\n\nWith 6.5 million youth entering the job market in the next decade and only 5 million boomers who may (not will) retire and reduce consumption, there is already labour oversupply coming.

For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.  I cited, briefly, one example of the current Secretary's success.  Ask the caseworkers locally at the St. Vincent de Paul Society who are working with VA to get homeless Veterans and their families off the streets.  They will tell you that, since the Obama Administration changes, they house one Vet a day.  That is success, no matter what biases you hold.",

The fact that their pension is based on best 5 years where those with RRSP's or defined contributions simply have a savings plan with no link to matching their best 5 years is simply unfair. You should know this, you're a pension expert. So when I have worked for 6 different employers (always employed, never missed a pay cheque) but have only accumulated enough in my RRSP to cover 15% of my best 5 years I say \"not fair\" that my taxes go to pay a benefit I could never dream of receiving myself. I think everyone in Canada, based on their own initiative should have a way of sheltering income for retirement similar to what we pay our public servants. It will cost the treasury a fortune, but its only fair!!",

No insurance companies have gone bankrupt as a result. \n\nApproximately 91% of Canadians polled feel that insurance companies should not be allowed access to their genetic information for an insurance assessment. Further, 90% of Canadians opposed the notion that employers should have access to the genetic information of workers or job applicants.\n\nWe all know that corporations control our MPs through their 'political donations', but it's a little much to have the Prime Minister so cravenly demonstrating where his allegiance lies.

But having co-signed a mortgage, the mother must now maintain the house and the payments in order to avoid a default and a possible 'joint and several' claim against her and her hubby. \n\nSadly there's no shortage of parents who have either refused to kick their offspring out of the nest or, worse still, put their own finances in jeopardy by helping them buy their own nest. Having not taught their daughter accountability and respect, she is unable to demand it of others. \n\nAs to what advice to give, that would depend on whether the parents - even at this late stage - are prepared to grow a spine. If the mother is also half-owner of the house, she could insist on selling it off. It's more likely though that she owns nothing but the debt, in which case I would predict this will end badly for everyone - except of course the scum boyfriend.",

Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. The plan of universal healthcare activists is to convince President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to transfer all the Medi-Cal billions to help leftist California finance a single-payer system, something they’d fear and deride as socialized medicine. The committee analysis assumed a 15% payroll tax on income. This in a state that already suffers from the highest income tax rates in the nation. But if all this happened, there’d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There’d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles — and therefore no self controls.

The saddest part of this though is that it will take a generation of such private insurance to reach the point that Australia is at now.

However, regardless of how much people in this country suffer politicians, who get preference regardless of what they say, will not allow the system to change. Examples abound of how lousy our system is: Australia knee surgery from go to whoa - 8 weeks, in Canada 18 months: Cataract surgery in Australia - a few weeks, in Canada 21 months.

Pope Benedict foretold that the Church would lose its influence and its numbers in the world as its members continue to surrender to the hedonistic secularism which has displaced  christianity in Western culture.\nProtestants claim in the creeds to believe in the Holy, Catholic Church but of course we know that they delude themselves.

Supporting gun controls, the Affordable Care Act, and the Clean Air Act have nothing to do with including women in the political process and informing them about issues and candidates, nor does abolishing the death penalty or opposing school vouchers, welfare reform, or the Keystone Pipeline. The LWV strongly supports abortion rights even though the victims of abortion are likely about 50% female. So much for their right to vote.",

And it's in those moments (but not just these moments) that God desires ever greater unity with us.\n\nAnd He gives us ways to learn how to do this, and He's ready with grace in His hands to help us do this.\n\nnext entry is a suggestion.",

It's a delicate balance which generally isn't explored too deeply here in the West for fear of raising uncomfortable discussions regarding the reform of Islam and its ties to political realities. \n\nMs Yousafzai argues that gender equality and commitment to universal education are not incompatible with Islam and that reform is best served as a movement from within Islam itself based upon Islamic teaching, that advancement for women within Islam is more about reclamation than reformation , while others such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali see equality as an outgrowth of Islamic reform as emanating from outside the faith, forcing change...,\n\nit's an important question, generally too problematic for western media and politicians, who prefer to view Ms Yousafzai for the most part through a lens focused only upon gender equality.",

(Is 2015 a bygone era?)  The building was a Protestant-style prayer barn but with a sanctuary rail and some improvements, the community was active, people were getting on fire for the faith, and nobody in his right mind thought of that rail being about the personal elevation of the priest over the laity.\n\nOLOP isn't my parish (and by choice, since it's closer than where I go) but I can't say they're not doing some things right.\n\nOf course one could always mention Cantius as another example.

The Republican party, traditionally associated with a hawkish stance toward Moscow, threw its support behind a presidential candidate who openly called on Russia to hack his opponent’s campaign.\n\nMajority leader Mitch McConnell told Obama and leading Democrats that he would regard any effort to release evidence of Russian interference before the election as partisan.

The American Catholic Church has always held to social justice for migrants, refugees, undocumented immigrants, poor people, workers, tackling climate change, tackling nuclear proliferation, questions of war and peace, etc. \n\nThese issues don't get as much attention because culture war issues are more important for liberals and conservatives in North American and Western culture. A Bishop criticizing abortion is much more likely to get attention than a bishop or priest showing solidarity with undocumented migrants at the U.S Mexico border. Not saying the former aren't important(because questions around human sexuality, Gender equality and reproductive issues are important) but we should recognize that when society says the Church is \"too obsessed\" with an issue.....it's more a reflection of what society feels is important rather than the Church itself.",

The other agencies were the departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, and two White House agencies (Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Office of Science and Technology Policy).\nClinton herself was not involved in the State Department’s review and did not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium One. As PolitiFact found, the majority of donations made to the Clinton Fdn were made before and during Clinton’s 2008 presidential run.

The nurses that were there that night couldn't find any solutions as to why he had these fainting spells.  I then even suggested to do blood work to see if anything could be detected from that.

The footage was fuzzy with no audio, and I am a big believer that people should comply with police commands in order to avoid a bad outcome, something Finicum clearly did not do, so I reserved judgement for the most part. This new footage with audio, the rationales discussed in the press conference, and the cover up of shots by the FBI all give me greater concern, not less.\n\nIt is clearly possible the police may have designed this situation to provoke an opportunity to shoot at least one of the high profile protesters to dissuade others from staging similar protests in the future.

(My grandmother thought she was in clover when she got OAS and Guaranteed income supplement) \nNow, people's needs. expectations, and life span have increased almost exponentially. and by the time the baby boomers all retire, there is no way that the workers will be able to support them/us in the style to which we've become accustomed. \nAt the same time, some have become enamoured of the idea that they're special and shouldn't pay tax, and there are aggressive tax planners who make a living trying to make it so.\nOur tax system needs to change.

I am sure, too, Luther's understanding of the role of the \"godly prince,\" which effectively insisted that a monarch had total control of the church, would not sit well with him (as it didn't sit well with republican Calvin).

I appreciated his willingness to call me and exchange views on the Lottery as well as other topics.  \n\nWhen he was fired he handled it with quiet dignity.  I communicated my sympathy and he accepted it with grace and without protestations of unfairness, etc.  I consider him a class act......were I talking to him I'd say \"a class act for a Republican\" and we'd laugh together.  \n\nThe findings of the investigation of Mr. Iparraguirre's actions clearly support that Mr. Roberts' actions in placing Mr. Iparraguirre on leave and seeking an independent investigation of the allegations against him were appropriate.

When you cut down a tree, you eliminate it's ability to store carbon in the future, but the products made from those trees still store that carbon ... it's locked up in the wood product. A tree that falls and rots stores some carbon in the soil, but most is released to the atmosphere. When trees operate in a system, forests are great carbon sinks, no doubt, but I think you're overestimating the value of a small patch of trees here that are not part of a larger forest system ... trees that are apparently getting knocked down by storms and probably rotting, based on other comments here. You'll get nearly as much carbon storage cutting and replanting as you will leaving them to rot in such a small clump.",

Regarding the Orlando killer, it's possible that he was gay, but he was a Muslim who lived with a woman he called his wife, and law enforcement officials have stated that he scoped out the nightclub where he killed people weeks before gunning those people down, and even went on Grindr in order to try and understand the mindset of gay men before he proceeded with his heinous atrocity. Some of the men he met on Grindr testified that they never had sex and that he was so \"creepy\" they left before anything happened.\n\nBut how telling that you would immediately jump to those particular conclusions in order to demonize all gay men as you typically do.

Under this current School Board, we have seen school closures, increased re-segregation, the warehousing of low-income kids in under-funded, struggling schools, the degradation of the teaching profession leading to record-level teacher turnover and shortages, academic and college remediation stagnation, in short, policies that have failed to give Denver the world-class schools it deserves. How the Post can be advocating sticking to such a lackluster series of policies and people is beyond me. If you want kids who can't read and charter chains making money hand over fist, feel free to support the Post's recommended candidates. If, however, you want a Board who will really listen to the needs and concerns of parents and communities, vote for Tay Anderson (District 4), Robert Speth (At Large), Carrie Olson (District 3) and Sochi Gaitan (District 2).",

Left as soon as I could, partly for the lack of support from local school board and community.  Fortunately, the National Science Foundation paid me to get my M.S. degree in Chemistry with all fees covered. I quickly moved on to an outstanding community college at one of the highest paying colleges in the country.  The respect from community, administration, and students was the difference between night and day.  \n\nBy having decent salaries and benefits, Eugene is able to attract the better teachers from all parts of the country.  Consider this (baby sitting wages): $10 an hour per student times 35 students equals $350 per class.  Five classes at $1750 a day times 190 days equals $332,500 per year.  $103,000 a year is a bargain!",

First off, I have a tremendous amount of empathy for my fellow human beings who are facing a profound upheaval in their lives. However, I have experience with family members who have lived in hotels like this off of Broadway. Lowering or subsidizing their rent will not help the problem in the long term. It temporarily puts off the inevitable future catastrophe. Without changing life habits and mindsets, these folks will just shuffle off to the next tenuous living situation. In my experience about a third of the people in this type of living arrangement are open to changing their lives. My family member was part of the 2/3 who aren't. I'm not judging, but this person was simply not ready to \"move up\" unless it was given to them. In this person's case, drugs were the reason, but spending time around these types of hotels, drugs aren't the only deciding factor. I used to eat at the restaurant across from the King's Inn.

Therefore this restriction on freedom does not conform to good democratic practice.  The dangers of second hand smoke are addressed by other laws prohibiting smoking in various places.  This law represents only the limitation of individual freedom because of the opinions and preferences of others.  In a free society, limitations on freedom should be avoided except when absolutely necessary.",

The government is closing the loophole, so the doctors now have to pay what they should have done all along, in common with most other Canadians.\n\nI find it unbelievable that many doctors would want to move to the USA because they were denied a loophole in their taxes.  This would imply that these doctors have no commitment to Canada or our way of life, and few if any family ties to keep them here.  Does the Globe really have evidence that many doctors would move, or is it just an imaginary claim in order to create more sensational articles?",

We were hopeful as he did very well with Chip's players and scheme, but it went downhill as they graduated and were not replaced with players of the same caliber, particularly at quarterback.  Defensive recruiting and coaching also suffered after Alioti left and was replaced in-house.  This year, inexperience and his bad play calling cost us games that we had to win, and losing created a downward spiral.  Helfrich is a wonderful person, but he just did not cut it as coach, on the field, staffing or recruiting, and it could be seen coming for more than a year.

Alexandre Bissonnette aurait vidé un premier chargeur avant de retourner à son véhicule pour en récupérer un second et poursuivre son carnage.\n\nOn ignore pour l’instant le modèle du pistolet qu’il a utilisé ainsi que le nombre de balles contenues dans les deux chargeurs qu’il aurait vidés. Au Canada, la capacité maximale d’un chargeur autorisée pour une arme de poing est de dix balles.\n\nLe jeune homme était également en possession d’une arme longue. Il l’aurait toutefois abandonnée dans le stationnement du Centre culturel islamique de Québec, possiblement parce qu’elle s’est enrayée ou que le suspect était à court de munitions\"",

Averages can be skewed by very  high/low earners, a more useful number is median salary.

We need more and deeper forms of equality, and more enlightened ones. Open marriages; independent finances maintained by both partners; more feminism; more honest psychology (less jealousy), and less pressure on legal unions so people make choices to be together for the best reasons and do not suffer if a union dissolves.",

A church community has every right to define itself and explain what that community believes the bible teaches. And to claim you can rebel and believe as you please and still remain a member is simply blatant rebellion.\n\nIf you don't agree, then you are free to withdraw from that community and join another, or start your own if you think you can.\n\nAnd the article is a false dilemma about authority. While the early church claimed final authority over the bible, they also claimed the right to kill anyone who disagreed and/or opposed their views.\n\nSo to equate the SDA church government with this false spirituality is not the facts of the matter. Dan Jackson should simply start his own church and quit rebelling against properly ordained authority in the SDA church.",

You are required to have LIABILITY insurance as a condition of being granted a driver's license. This protects other motorists and your own assets. (Insurance on the vehicle is usually a condition of borrowing the money to buy the car. This protects the lien holder, no one else, although it's prudent to protect your own assets.) \n\nTo apply the parallel to health coverage, you would require insurance as a condition of being alive. This is unique in the entire economy. (Never mind that you have the option of paying for your health care by numerous other means.)\n\nHuge distinction.\n\nWhile it's a wise purchase -- like auto or homeowners insurance -- health insurance doesn't necessarily protect anyone else. If your interest is enforcing responsibility -- as defined by whom, by the way? -- one is simply liable for his own bills. That requires no mandate or enforcement by the state over a private transaction.",

I don't think that people should be forced as they are now to pay for insurance, but if they get sick and have to go to the Medicare option, they should have to pay a penalty for getting the coverage.  But this should only apply to those who make above x% of the poverty level, so the poor aren't being penalized.  I would also only expand Medicare to cover the poor with certain chronic conditions and disabilities (including mental and addictions), children, and the working poor or those on unemployment.  I have some relatives who are just lazy and choose not to work (they are \"bloggers\" instead) and are getting Medicaid under the expansion.",

The failure to do so has given the public the impression that Secretary Clinton and her associates received special treatment,” Sen. Grassley said in the letter.",

What would help even more would be a requirement that food workers be given paid sick leave.  Food workers are generally poorly paid as it is, and it is a hardship for them to take off from work when they are ill, so they have a strong incentive to come to work even when ill.
