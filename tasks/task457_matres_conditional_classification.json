        "You will be given a context and a verb separated with a newline character. You have to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action or not. We say a verb is hypothetical if it involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. A verb is conditional if it appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else. Note that an event that happened in the past or is happening now cannot be conditional. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb is conditional or hypothetical and \"No\" otherwise."
