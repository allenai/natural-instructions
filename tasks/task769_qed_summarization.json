The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate . Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone ( GH ) , a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland .",

The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror , an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole 's novel . It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where , following Walpole , it was further developed by Clara Reeve , Ann Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis . The genre had much success in the 19th century , as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella , A Christmas Carol , and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron and Poe . Another well known novel in this genre , dating from the late Victorian era , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula . The name Gothic refers to the ( pseudo ) - medieval buildings , emulating Gothic architecture , in which many of these stories take place . This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany . The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French Georgia .",

Even though he has been `` Ranger of the Month '' at Brickleberry for several years , he does not appear to display good skills or even common sense . Steve 's `` Ranger of the Month '' title means everything to him and he will do anything to keep it . Despite his extreme lack of intelligence , he knows the Brickleberry park very well because his father was also a Brickleberry ranger , so Steve was raised in the park . He dreamed of working at Brickleberry since he was a child in order to follow in his father 's footsteps . He is shown to have a man crush on Viggo Mortensen . Woodrow `` Woody '' Johnson ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) -- Woody is a 55 - year - old , abrasive ranger with a military background . In the `` Crippleberry '' episode , he mentions to Steve that he is technically a war criminal . He worked his way up to head ranger over his 30 - year career at Brickleberry . He worked alongside Steve 's father , but never searched for him when Jonah went missing . He always has the park 's best interest in mind and struggles to boost the dwindling tourism numbers by any means . In `` 2 Weeks Notice '' , he accidentally confesses to Malloy that when his mother died , his father forced him to dress up in her lingerie , implying that he may have been sexually abused by his father . It is also revealed in season 2 that Woody was a former porn star named Rex Erection . Ethel Anderson ( voiced by Kaitlin Olson in season 1 , Natasha Leggero in season 2 and 3 ) -- Ethel is an attractive , 25 - year - old female ranger . She was the top ranger at Yellowstone and was transferred to Brickleberry in an effort to get the park back on track ( and because she was fired from Yellowstone for being drunk on the job ) . She is passionate for animals and nature and does her best to treat her co-workers kindly . Steve sees Ethel as a threat to his Ranger of the Month title , while Ethel sees Steve as a bumbling idiot . Ethel possesses extraordinary ranger skills , but is much more humble than Steve . Denzel Jackson ( voiced by Jerry Minor ) -- Denzel is a black ranger who is horrible at his job , but ca n't be fired because he works for a government agency . Denzel is a gerontophile , which occasionally gets him into hot water . Denzel finds his job challenging because he 's afraid of bugs , snakes , and pretty much anything else that inhabits the woods . It was revealed in the first season that his father and father 's father and grandfather 's father were undercover cops , but Denzel has no interest in following in their footsteps . For the rest of the series it is not mentioned again . Connie Cunaman ( voiced by Roger Black ) -- Connie is a lesbian female ranger who has a large body , immense strength , and a deep voice that is often mistaken for a male . In `` Gay Bomb '' , Connie admits she is a lesbian and it is revealed to the viewers that her strength is dubbed by her as `` lesbian strength '' . Connie is capable of lifting massive objects , such as trees , bears , and even a real bomb . She is obsessed with Ethel and was turned away by her Evangelical parents for being a homosexual . On a side note , when Connie gets excited , her vagina makes growling noises similar to that of a stomach , requiring her to talk it down like a wild animal . Malloy ( voiced by Daniel Tosh ) -- Malloy is the last surviving member of his species Ursus loquacious that Woody has taken in and spoiled after Steve accidentally ran over and shot his parents , telling him a tourist did it . Woody lets him play video games all day and eat junk food . Malloy is very crude , racist , sexist , has a superiority complex , and in some ways is a narcissist . He openly hates the rangers and in addition , he enjoys putting them down and messing with them on a daily basis , especially Steve .",

The Vancouver - based Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime ( Funimation had previously used the Ocean voice cast in their short - lived 1995 dub of Dragon Ball ) . Saban musicians Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet , known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise , composed a new background score and theme song ( nicknamed `` Rock the Dragon '' ) . Funimation 's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length , which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53 . It premiered in the United States on September 13 , 1996 in first - run syndication , but halted production in 1998 after two seasons . This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations , in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block . Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 ( the end of the dub ) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version , but did not do so .",

Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20 , 1860 , its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor . On December 26 , Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan 's Island to Fort Sumter , a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor . An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9 , 1861 . South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter .",

Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture , the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that `` wash '' the ceiling in light . In small ways , hints of Art Moderne can be seen , in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion . FDR and Gugler worked closely together , often over breakfast , with Gugler sketching the president 's ideas . One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room 's furniture , is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace .

The story begins on a cold , windy day in fictional Dickson County ( representing Dickinson County , Iowa ) with Martha Hale being abruptly called to ride to a crime scene . In the buggy is Lewis Hale , her husband , Sheriff Peters , the county sheriff , and Mrs. Peters , the sheriff 's wife . She rushes out to join them in the buggy , and the group sets off . They arrive at the crime scene : the Wrights ' lonesome - looking house . Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright ( the dead man 's wife ) twenty years prior . Once the whole group is safely inside the house , Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior . Despite the serious circumstances , he delivers his story in a long - winded and poorly thought - out manner , tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout . The story begins with Mr. Hale venturing to Mr. Wright 's house to convince Wright to get a telephone . Upon entering the house , he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled . The women 's curious nature and very peculiar attention to minute details allows them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright 's guilt and of her provocations and motives . Meanwhile , the men are unable to procure any evidence . The women find the one usable piece of evidence : the dead bird in the box . It 's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her . But now finding her bird is dead , with a broken neck ( with the implication that the husband killed it ) it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband . Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two `` midwestern rural women '' to understand Mrs. Wright 's suffering when the only living thing around her has died . The women find justification in Mrs. Wright 's actions and go about hiding what they find from the men . In the end , their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction . The story ends here , and does not move into the occurrences after they leave the house .",

Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853 . In May 1884 , working at home , Koechlin made a sketch of their idea , described by him as `` a great pylon , consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top , joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals '' . Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm , but he did approve further study , and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre , the head of company 's architectural department , to contribute to the design .

Drake drilled the world 's first oil well in 1859 at Titusville , Pennsylvania , USA , history registered another exploration of the black liquid gold , in the largest continent . More than a century ago , history was made in a remote corner of Assam in the midst of the dense and malaria infested jungles , by a band of intrepid pioneers searching for black gold . In 1867 Italian Engineers , commissioned by the Assam Railways and Trading Company , to build a railway line from Dibrugarh to Margherita ( Headquarters of Assam Railways and Trading Company ) accidentally discovered oil at Digboi around 10 miles from Margherita . ' Dig boy , dig ' , shouted the English engineer , Mr WL Lake , elephants emerging out of the dense forest with oil stains on their feet '' . This is possibly the most distilled -- though fanciful -- version of the legend explaining the siting and naming of Digboi . Two events separated by seven years have become fused , but although neither is likely to be provable , such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible . Various web sites offer variations on the elephant 's foot story , a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru - Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company ( AR&TC ) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm 's feet smelled of oil . Retracing the trail of footprints , they found oil seeping to the surface . One of the engineers , the Englishman Willie Leova Lake , was an ' oil enthusiast ' and persuaded the company to drill a well . Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants ' feet in its company history , although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed `` the oil seepages around Borbhil '' . Once the project had been approved , Lake assembled equipment , boilers , and local labour , and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site . The first well was started in September 1889 , but an encouraging first strike at 178 feet ( 54 m ) turned out to be a small pocket , and drilling recommenced . This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 feet ( 202 m ) , and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India 's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to `` Dig , boy !

Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but is seen as an independent artistic culture , separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy .

Two of Cynewulf 's signed poems were discovered in the Vercelli Book , which includes Cynewulf 's holy cross poem `` Elene '' as well as Dream of the Rood . Where many scholars will argue that all of the poems in the Vercelli are in fact Cynewulf 's , the noted German scholar Franz Dietrich demonstrates that the similarities between Cynewulf 's `` Elene '' and The Dream of the Rood reveals that the two must have been authored by the same individual . Dietrich makes four main arguments : one , the theme of both poems is the cross , and more importantly , in both poems , the cross suffers with Christ ; two , in `` Elene '' Cynewulf seems to make clear references to the same cross in Dream of the Rood ; three , in `` Elene '' and his other poems Cynewulf usually speaks of himself , which makes it quite possible that the dreamer in Dream of the Rood is none other than Cynewulf himself ; and finally four , `` In both poems the author represents himself as old , having lost joys or friends and as ready to depart .",

X-ray filtration may be inherent due to the X-ray tube and housing material itself or added from additional sheets of filter material . The minimum filtration used is usually 2.5 mm aluminium ( Al ) equivalent , although there is an increasing trend to use greater filtration .

Even though Darin was reluctant to release the song as a single , in 1959 it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Black Singles chart , and earned him a Grammy Award for Record of the Year . Dick Clark had advised Darin not to record the song because of the perception that , having come from an opera , it would not appeal to the rock and roll audience . In subsequent years , Clark recounted the story with good humor . Frank Sinatra , who recorded the song with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lady album , called Darin 's the `` definitive '' version . Billboard ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959 . Darin 's version was No. 3 on Billboard 's All Time Top 100 . In 2003 , the Darin version was ranked # 251 on Rolling Stone 's `` 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' list . On BBC Radio 4 's Desert Island Discs , pop mogul Simon Cowell named `` Mack the Knife '' the best song ever written .

In most cases , the first step involves gasification , which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk . Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid . Therefore , biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide , hydrogen , and traces of methane . This gas mixture , called a producer gas , can provide fuel for various vital processes , such as internal combustion engines , as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications . Because any biomass material can undergo gasification , this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production , where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel .

They typically were post-millennialist ; that is , they believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind rid itself of social evils by human effort . The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity .

The NBA 's Minneapolis Lakers had relocated to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul to support the team . Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other , so his desire was to name the team the `` Twin Cities Twins '' , however MLB objected . Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins . However , the team was allowed to keep its original `` TC '' ( for Twin Cities ) insignia for its caps . The team 's logo shows two men , one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform , shaking hands across the Mississippi River within an outline of the state of Minnesota . The `` TC '' remained on the Twins ' caps until 1987 , when they adopted new uniforms . By this time , the team felt it was established enough to put an `` M '' on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis . The `` TC '' logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys , and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design . Both the `` TC '' and `` Minnie & Paul '' logos remain the team 's primary insignia . As of 2010 , the `` TC '' logo has been reinstated on the cap as their logo .",

( An alternative tradition that `` Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote Isaiah , Proverbs , the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes '' probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah . ) Nevertheless , critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin .

The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the Persian or the Hellenistic periods ( i.e. , the earlier or later part of this period ) revolves around the degree of Hellenization ( influence of Greek culture and thought ) present in the book . Scholars arguing for a Persian date ( c. 450 -- 330 BCE ) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence ; those who argue for a Hellenistic date ( c. 330 -- 180 BCE ) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting .",

More specifically , the ISPE 's guide The Good Automated Manufacturing Practice ( GAMP ) Guide for Validation of Automated Systems in Pharmaceutical Manufacture describes a set of principles and procedures that help ensure that pharmaceutical products have the required quality . One of the core principles of GAMP is that quality can not be tested into a batch of product but must be built into each stage of the manufacturing process . As a result , GAMP covers all aspects of production ; from the raw materials , facility and equipment to the training and hygiene of staff . Standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) are essential for processes that can affect the quality of the finished product .",

However , the aforegoing presumes one knows in advance which ear is defective and which is normal ( such as the patient telling the clinician that they can not hear as well in one ear versus the other ) and the testing is being done to characterize the type , conductive or sensorineural , of hearing loss that is occurring . In the case where the patient is unaware or has acclimated to their hearing loss , the clinician has to use the Rinne test in conjunction with the Weber to characterize and localize any deficits .

Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer .",

Robbie ( Don Grady ) marries his classmate / girlfriend , Katie Miller ( Tina Cole ) . Tina Cole , in fact , had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes of My Three Sons : `` House For Sale '' from the fourth season ( February 13 , 1964 ) , `` The Coffee House Set '' from the fifth season ( November 19 , 1964 ) , and `` Robbie and the Little Stranger '' from the sixth season ( February 17 , 1966 ) . At the end of the 1967 - 1968 season , the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens .
