American Idol projects lyrics and score information on the back wall of the theatre , which is why they are always looking out at the audience . Country Bear , Voyages of the Little Mermaid , and others also have the reflective captioning . I think even Fantasmic has it , but it may just be an assistive hearing device . Some theaters can handle a hand held device for captioning shows and attractions , some can handle translation via red large red headphones . My favorite is at Festival of the Lion King where , when a group comes in that is deaf , we will put two people translating under spotlights and have them dance and sign the entire show . The other neat things ? If we run out , you may get handed a printed script to read from . If you are in a theater during a show , watch the cast as a lot of us will lip sync or even do small dances to the show while it runs , so you can get an idea of what is coming up from us .

For your safety . So there I was , in the middle of the Atlantic ocean , on top of the sail , no harness , no safety tags , none of the above .

Or realistically , you might have said , `` Oh , just a second , I 'm almost finished here anyway '' or something similar . You would n't have completely ignored him , and then acted completely unchastized when you got reprimanded afterwards . Say what you want about cutting corners in the name of efficiency . Do n't try to convince me it 's OK to flippantly ignore direct orders from your CO / team whenever you feel like it , as long as nobody gets hurt .

Let 's be honest , though , it does n't matter how much they butcher his book , it is still a story of God 's chosen few bringing on and surviving the end of the world to rebuild society the way it should be . That sort of thing appeals to a lot of people with a certain worldview , so It would have to be absolutely awful to not be a box office success .",
                "It 's the inconsistency with which the projects bearing his name have been developed , as well as the endorsements of things simply not that good . The Stand has religious undertones , for sure , but I 've never considered it the primary motivation . His work tends to be less heaven / hell and more good / evil , with Randall Flagg being the source of evil in this case . Depending on how it 's done , this can go either way ."

                "Sheesh . There 's no short way to tell this , but in 2010 I moved to LA , and was working and studying at Upright Citizens Brigade , which had long been a dream of mine . The same week my classes ended - I lost my job . For a few weeks I was just writing and smoking joints on the beach , which , though it 's a good gig if you can get it - does n't exactly pay the bills . So with no ties , I decided to say fuck it , buy a plane ticket to New Jersey , and pursue a lifelong dream of running across America . For four months and 3,000 miles I ran like a stupid asshole by myself , through hurricanes , shin splints , tropical storms , blizzards , mountain lions , food poisoning , and a litany of other things I probably should have known about but was too lazy to research beforehand . I got married along the way too . I was a runaway husband , is my running joke ( that 's two in one ) , and the goal was to finish by Valentine 's Day , as I 'd already missed Thanksgiving and Christmas with my wife to spend each of them stuck in a shack , waiting out ice storms in different parts of the country . With four days left I reached Amboy , CA on the outskirts of the Mojave , near Joshua Tree . And with nothing for almost a hundred miles in any direction , that Amboy had a gas station at all was a blessing . There 's a sign in front of the facility that says Roy 's Motel and Cafe . Except there is no motel . Or cafe . They both shut down . The town proper has a population of 4 . Yes - FOUR . You really should read a bit about it . It 's a pretty interesting town . Even aside from housing an airplane hangar that Harrison Ford uses . Here 's their [ wiki ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Amboy , _California ) . For context , I was caught in an ice storm in Amarillo about a month before . Having been too dumb to research , I had no idea it snowed in Texas . Let alone had lethal , prolonged ice storms . But I was fortunate enough to meet a family - total strangers - that put me up for the week and fed me , kept me warm , and offered wonderful company . The hardest part about the trip was the psychological aspect of it , talking to maybe just a couple people a day for a few minutes at a time . It was incredibly lonely , and any company was very much appreciated . Well this family , bless their hearts , the last night I was there the patriarch , Seth , the man I owed my safety to , got a call that his dad had just passed away . i 'd met him the day before , and could only look on with envy at the way his grandkids - and son - admired him , and hung on his every word like it was bible . It was absolutely heart-wrenching . And I knew I could n't stay any longer . The next day we bid farewell . But before we did an old hippie friend of the family 's pulled me aside . `` If I give you something . Will you take it ? '' he asked . I asked what it was . `` Three tabs of dynamite LSD. '' In case it 's not apparent , this trip was very much about rediscovering the excitement of life , of seeing what 's out there . So you can bet your sweet sweatpants I took that old hippie 's LSD. `` Now save this for something special . Something beautiful . Something you might never see any time else . A mountain top . A gorgeous sunset . You 'll know when to do it . '' Which brings me back to February 9th , 2011 . I reached Amboy in the early afternoon , and asked the man at the station with the thousand yard stare ( think Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie 'Nightcrawler ' ) what 's in Amboy . `` Besides the rattlesnakes , tarantulas and wolves ? Not a damn thing . You 're lookin at it . '' This was not reassuring . `` Well , '' he retorted . `` You * could * hike up the crater . '' Turns out there 's a dormant volcano a couple miles away , with a hiking path that people walk up . Considering there was n't enough daylight to push the 35 miles to the next town of Twentynine Palms , I stowed my gear at the station , packed a bag of water and foodstuffs , toasted my LSD to the gods above , tossed it down the hatch , and made for the volcano in the hell-hot afternoon . Here 's a [ pic ] ( http : / imgur.com / UmVPtGb ) before the drugs took hold . I made a playlist of Kraftwerk , LCD Soundsystem , James Brown and choice others , and proceeded to dance gleefully - sometimes nude , sometimes not - in the outlying lava field at the base of the crater as waves of anxious childlike curiosity washed over me . As afternoon turned to pre-dusk the drugs took hold WITH A FURY , and I thought , `` Whoooooa . How cool would it be to watch the sunset from ATOP the volcano ? '' And that was that . I left my pack at the Visitor 's Center parking lot and sprinted the mile to the crater as fast as my legs could take me , over mounds of volcanic ash and cobwebbed holes with signs reading `` CAUTION : TARANTULAS . '' And I can promise you : I 've never run faster , and harder , with as big of a shit-eating grin on as I did that day . I skipped and yelled and sang as I reached the base of the crater , caught between a rock and a hard place . Take the mile-long footpath up - and maybe miss the sunset - or find a different way . * Make * a different way . This was no choice really . I ran STRAIGHT UP that fucking volcano at the speed of acid , clawing my way up that crag of loose , razor sharp rock as fast as the drugs would allow me . And sure as life is fucking amazing , I reached the peak ( in all senses ) just as the sun began to set . It was FUCKING . AMAZING . Words will never do it justice . To me it 's one of the happiest moments of my life . Volcano + Sunset + LSD + Me . I would have never imagined it , and it was truly all because of that old hippie in Amarillo . But the mood turned ON A DIME . The realization was a kick in the dick . I left my headlamp in my bag . And once this sunlight goes ... I 'm * fucked . * What you do n't learn in the city is that nature does n't give a flying fuck about you . Your family , your neighbors , your facebook friends - yes . But no one is looking for you in the desert . The desert gives less than no fucks . And in an instant , the mood was over . I roared screamingly down that volcano as fast as I could , lacerating my legs and arms on the jagged rock , hoping for nothing more than to not get sodomized by the pack of nearby howling wolves after nightfall . Bloodied to shit I reached the bottom , and began my aimless sprint through the dark towards the unknown location where my backpack and headlamp resided . My mind began to turn on me , playing back all those Faces of Death clips I watched growing up - and should have learned from - shaming me into my resounding fate that , yes , this was a * really * bad idea . And maybe I could survive a night alone in the freezing darkness of the desert on acid with a short-sleeve shirt and shorts . But at the time it meant nothing but d-e-a-t-h . Thankfully - miraculously ! - I ended up stumbling upon my pack just as pitch-blackness draped over the desert , and I raced back to Roy 's with the [ smirk ] ( http : / imgur.com / R1HOdIj ) of a man who just petted heavily with death . I sat in Roy 's doodling , journalling , and trying to contend with my visual hallucinations , until they closed an hour later . Before retiring to my windowless , open-air room in the airplane hangar , I asked Gyllenhaal if I was gon na be alright outside . You know : with the rattlesnakes and spiders and wolves and shit . And you know what that heartless son of a bitch said ? `` I do n't know . I do n't sleep outside . '' And with that , he locked up , and I sat in my tent for another couple of hours as the wind screamed and a wolf pack howled in the distance , doing anything to keep my mind off the four- and eight-legged creatures waiting to savage me in the night . The last thing I did before bed was send a message to a friend that said : `` I exist in a world where pizza orders people . '' I still do n't know what the hell that means . But I made it safely through the night . Until I got kidnapped by a meth-head the next day while hungover on LSD.

                "I love both Alien and Aliens , though I do have a preference for the first . Now Aliens is a great action film , which tried to be different from the original ( which is a good thing.. you do n't want the sequel to be identical to the first ) . However , I must say the problem with Aliens is that there 's one thing in the mythology that it kind of shat on . In the original Alien , the single creature ( Xenomorph ) is established as practically unkillable . The perfect organism . In Aliens they become a swarm , which the characters proceed to exterminate in numbers with their guns . That has always kind of bothered me . A friend of mine had only seen Alien and Alien 3 . He was a huge fan of Alien but for some reason had never seen the other movies . So I showed Aliens to him , and he was shocked at the different image of the xenomorphs in that film , as he was n't used to it . I can totally understand .",
                "Thing is , in Alien , they never had the weaponry that the Colonial Marines had , in Aliens . Talking about this subject though , I have the same problem with T-2 . In the first Terminator movie , Arnold 's Terminator is meant to be the ultimate killing machine , extremely hard to kill etc . Yet in the sequel , a new one comes along and makes Arnold 's look practically obsolete .",

The context was the cops asking why Reese could n't bring back any 'ray guns ' . Full exchange : > Dr . Silberman : Why did n't you bring any weapons , something more advanced ? Do n't you have , uh ... ray guns ? Show me a piece of future technology . > Detective Vukovich : [ chuckling ] Ray guns ? > Kyle Reese : You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . Nothing dead will go . > Dr . Silberman : Why ? > Kyle Reese : I did n't build the fucking thing ! > Dr . Silberman : Okay , okay .

It had a very good script , much better than it needed to be . It was also very skillfully directed ; Andrew got some great performances out of the leads . But they blew so much money on the visual effects that the movie was never going to turn a profit no matter what . It was doomed from go .
