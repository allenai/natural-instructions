Your job is to alter sentence 2 so that the pair neither agree nor contradict each other. Generated sentences must be short, with less than 15 words. New information can be introduced. Avoid using pronouns to confuse the subject of the sentence."

            "input": "Sentence 1: Jon saw his friend Tom coming out of the grocery store with a bag of fruit. Sentence 2: Tom had not been in the store.",
            "output": "Tom had been shopping for fruit to give Jon.",
            "explanation": "The given sentence is a good alteration. If the changed sentence was something like: \"Tom had been sleeping in his house in that time\", it'd contradict the first sentence. But this given sentence neither agrees with the first sentence, nor contradicts it."

        {
            "input": "Sentence 1: The girl transferred all the flowers from the boquet to a vase. Sentence 2: The girl took flowers from the vase to make a boquet.",
            "output": "The flowers will soon wither.",
            "explanation": "Since it is not known if the flowers are real or not, the given sentence doesn't contradict the first sentence, so it's a good alteration."
