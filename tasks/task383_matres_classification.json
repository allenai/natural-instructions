    "Definition": "You will be given a context and a verb separated with a newline character, and you have to answer if the given verb can be anchored in time or not. We say a verb can be anchored in the real timeline if and only if a verb happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time and \"No\" otherwise.",

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."
