    "Definition": [
        "In this task, a passage will be given and the goal is to generate a question about temporal relations based on that passage. A temporal relation describes the relation between two things with respect to time e.g., something happens/starts/terminates/... immediately/shortly/usually/... before/after/during/... something else.\n Your question should include an event, or ask about an event, and should not be a yes/no question."
