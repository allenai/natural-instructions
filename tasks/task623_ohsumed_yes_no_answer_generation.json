            "input": "Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Ventricular Fibrillation 2)Transportation of Patients 3)Allied Health Personnel",

            "input": "Abstract: Intraosseous infusions were widely used in pediatric patients during the 1930s and 1940s. Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Carbon Monoxide Poisoning 2)Transportation 3) Allied Health Personnel",

            "input": "Abstract: As the use of helicopters for air transport of critically ill patients increases, the availability of monitoring devices for physiological parameters during flight becomes important. It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Transportation of Patients 2)Aircraft 3) Blood Gas Monitoring",

            "input": "Abstract: The lifetime prevalence of psychiatric illness was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus (types I and II) who were selected randomly from patients undergoing diabetes evaluations at a large medical center. The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Amino Acid Sequence 2)Animal 3)Base Sequence",

Improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 (76%) patients in Group 1 with a mean period of treatment (+/- SD) of 2.7 +/- 0.6 months, in one patient in Group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment, and in 16 (84%) patients in Group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 +/- 1.2 weeks. No side-effects were observed in any of these trials. These data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin D3 and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged 4)Calcitonin 5)Cholecalciferols 6)Dihydroxycholecalciferols 7)Female 8)Human 9)Hydroxycholecalciferols 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Parathyroid Hormones 13)Psoriasis 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Age Factors 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool 4)Denmark 5)Female 6)Human 7)Male 8)Neuroblastoma 9)Prognosis 10)Regression Analysis 11)Sex Factors.",

            "input": "Abstract: Cell cultures of human keratinocytes contain membrane-associated thioredoxin reductase that is extremely active in reducing radicals on the outer plasma membrane. This enzyme activity was confirmed by its purification from cultures of stratified human keratinocytes by affinity column chromatography. The enzyme was assayed both in vivo and in vitro using a spin-labeled quaternary ammonium compound as the substrate, under saturating conditions in free radical substrate. Specific activities were determined by monitoring the sequential decrease in the amplitude of the electron spin resonance signal per unit of cell protein. The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Carrier Proteins 2)Olfactory Mucosa 3)Receptors, Sensory",

Fourteen hybridomas producing antibody against TSST-1 were isolated independently. The culture supernatant and ascitic fluids from each were analyzed to determine the mAb isotypes. Seven of the mAb were IgG1, and the remaining seven were IgM; all the mAb had kappa light chains. Immunoglobulin was partially purified from hybridoma-generated ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and tested for the ability to block TSST-1-induced mitogenicity and immunosuppression. Three mAb (all IgG1) were shown to block both the toxin-induced mitogenicity and the suppression. None of the mAb tested inhibited just one of the two toxin activities. The neutralizing mAb were then used in Western analysis with previously mapped cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-generated toxin fragments to localize the aforementioned biologic functions. The Western blot analysis showed that the mitogenic and the suppressive functions of TSST-1 were located on a 14,000 dalton internal CNBr fragment. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Adult 3)Body Burden",

Twenty-five patients with severe symptoms and ejection fractions of 25% or less were studied to determine the lowest ventricular filling pressures that could be achieved with vasodilator and diuretic therapy while maintaining cardiac output. In 20 of 25 patients normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWs) were achieved (mean 10 mm Hg compared with 30 mm Hg at baseline). Stroke volume was 60 vs 39 ml at baseline. Stroke work index was 30 vs 19 g-m/m2. For each patient, over the range of PCWs, stroke volume and stroke work index were maintained and were often maximal at the lowest PCW achieved. The upright position was well tolerated in patients with normal supine PCW. Normal filling pressures can be achieved in patients with congestive heart failure without compromise of cardiac output. While congestive symptoms should be improved, the feasibility and benefit of maintaining normal filling pressures over a long term must be established. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cardiac Output 2)Cardiomyopathy, Congestive 3)Coronary Disease 4)Diuretics 5)Heart Catheterization 6)Heart Ventricle 7)Hemodynamics 8)Human 9)Prospective Studies 10)Rheumatic Heart Disease 11)Vasodilator Agents",

With subsequent balloon angioplasty, the lesion was further decreased to 10% residual stenosis. The entire procedure was well tolerated without chest pain or burning, vessel perforation or spasm, thrombus formation or embolization of debris. The patient was free of pain at 1 month follow-up. This case demonstrates the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty.

The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL. The ease of obtaining summary ratings from clinical personnel suggests that further exploration of this rapid quantification of patient health is warranted. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Arterial Occlusive Diseases 3)Arteriovenous Fistula",

The subjects were requested to draw on a graphic tablet triangles and squares of different size and shape. The patients produced a larger number of EMG burst compared with controls. The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Catecholamines 3)Cell Differentiation",

The STL of the male patients with carcinoma was lower (446 +/- 149 ng/dl) than that of the male control group (532 +/- 132 ng/dl) (P less than 0.001). Even 17 male patients of the early carcinoma showed lower STL (440 +/- 117 ng/dl) than the normal group (P less than 0.001). In the female patients, it was also lower (31.6 +/- 16.0 ng/dl) than in the control group (46.3 +/- 15.3 ng/dl) (P less than 0.005). The postoperative STL of the cases surviving the gastrectomy was higher than the preoperative data in 32 male patients (P less than 0.005) as well as in 12 female patients (0.025 greater than P greater than 0.01), whereas it obviously decreased in the patients who died of recurrence.

Review of the literature and the comparison with blood dicyclomine values from four rabbits given equivalent doses suggests that a blood dicyclomine value of 200 ng/mL probably is in the therapeutic range for infants. Although safely used for years for infantile colic, recently, the administration of dicyclomine has been related to acute episodes of apnea, seizures, and coma. In the absence of those acute reactions, we feel that a 200-ng/mL blood dicyclomine level in a child dying of apparent SIDS should not prevent categorization of the death as SIDS. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Body Temperature 3)Body Temperature Regulation",

            "input": "Abstract: Between January 1979 and June 1985, 10 patients with acute allergic interstitial nephritis were seen in a clinical nephrology service at a large regional hospital. The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection. The improvement in renal function after discontinuation of the implicated drug, the characteristic histopathological findings of allergic interstitial nephritis, and the presence of eosinophils and sometimes IgE in the blood suggest a hypersensitivity reaction. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acute Disease 2)Adult 3)Aged 4)Aged, 80 and over 5)Allopurinol 6)Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal 7)Antibiotics 8)Cephaloridine 9)Cimetidine 10)Female 11)Fenoprofen 12)Human 13)Indomethacin 14)Kidney 15)Male 16)Middle Age 17)Nephritis, Interstitial 18)Penicillins",

            "input": "Abstract: RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Heart Failure, Congestive 2)Heart Ventricle 3)Human 4)Intraoperative Complications 5)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 6)Vascular Resistance.",

We have now evaluated more dilute concentrations of bleomycin in the treatment of recalcitrant warts. Warts were assigned for therapy with intralesional bleomycin at a concentration of 0.25 U/ml, 0.5 U/ml, or 1 U/ml at 3-week intervals. If warts persisted after three injections or had recurred by 3 months' follow-up, treatment was considered a failure. Twenty-six patients whose warts had persisted after conventional treatment entered the study. Three patients had spontaneous regression of untreated warts during therapy and were not included in the results. Of seventy-nine warts treated with intralesional bleomycin, sixty-two (78%) were cured after one to three injections. Responding warts showed a hemorrhagic eschar even with the lower bleomycin concentrations and healed without complication. Almost all treated warts responded, although not all were cured. Treatment with bleomycin at 0.5 U/ml was as effective as treatment with 1 U/ml. Bleomycin at 0.25 U/ml is effective therapy but not enough warts were treated to permit a conclusion when compared with higher concentrations. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Comparative Study 3)Creatinine",

Pentamidine administration produced fever, severe myositis, and clinical deterioration, and therefore, desensitization to TMS was attempted. This was done with low doses of oral suspension and then intravenous administration during a period of 60 hours. The patient reacted with fevers, arthralgia, and erythema that cleared 4 days after the desensitization was completed. This single case of successful desensitization to TMS in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggests that the oral route may be useful in similar situations when this drug is urgently needed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Beverages 2)Carbohydrates 3)Exertion",

Fifteen percent of all subjects (or 84% of subjects classified LPE IgE antibody positive [Ab +]) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p I (Rye I), and 4% of all subjects (or 26% of subjects classified LPE IgE Ab +) was classified IgE Ab + to highly purified Lol p II (Rye II). These data and similar results obtained in an allergy-enriched group of 361 subjects are consistent with previous studies that Lol I is a major allergen and Lol II is a minor allergen of LPE. Whether we studied LPE, Lol I, or Lol II, responder subjects were younger than nonresponder subjects and more male than female subjects were responders. We then investigated the quantitative interrelationships among ST, IgE, and IgG Ab responsiveness to LPE, Lol I, and Lol II in the allergy-enriched group. For each allergen, log-log correlations were strong and significant for ST versus IgE Ab and for IgE Ab versus IgG Ab. All subjects IgE Ab + to Lol I or Lol II were IgG Ab + to that allergen, supporting other evidence for a commonality in the genetic control influencing the production of IgE and IgG Abs to a given allergen. Log-log correlations among ST end points, IgE Ab levels, or IgG Ab levels were strong for LPE versus either Lol I or Lol II but weak between Lol I and Lol II, consistent with the reported lack of cross-reactivity between Lol I and Lol II. Despite these findings, almost all Lol II + subjects were Lol I + by ST (98%), IgE Ab (91%), and IgG Ab (83%), suggesting that the Ia-restricted immune recognition of both these molecules is at least in part under a common genetic control. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Administration, Inhalation 2)Administration, Intranasal 3)Adult",

The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aluminum 2)Blood Proteins 3)Deferoxamine 4)Hemodialysis 5)Human 6)Kinetics 7)Permeability 8)Time Factors.",

Significant increases in airway responsiveness to histamine (tenfold fall in PC20 FEV1) were documented 7 hours after exposure for 5 minutes to red cedar while baseline spirometry remained unchanged. A dual asthmatic reaction was induced during the following days by exposing the subject to red-cedar sawdust for 30 minutes and plicatic acid for 7 minutes. After recovery of PC20, the subject was reexposed to plicatic acid for 15 and 30 seconds on 2 consecutive days. No significant changes in FEV1, forced vital capacity, and residual volume were demonstrated in the following 8 hours, although minimal changes in forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC were observed. PC20 dropped significantly and required 2 weeks to recover. This example illustrates that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine can precede the changes in airway caliber after an antigen challenge. It also demonstrates that such changes can persist for up to 2 weeks after the challenge, even when no significant changes in FEV1 are induced. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Action Potentials 2)Electrodiagnosis 3)Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory",

The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Biopsy, Needle 2)Diagnosis, Differential 3)Human",

Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years. In 14 patients without HT cells, 3 had recurrences and 1 developed a carcinoma 6 years later. HT cells were found in 15 patients with T1 & T2 carcinomas; residual carcinoma was present in 2 after radiotherapy and 4 had recurrences within 11 months. Fourteen patients with T1 & T2 carcinoma did not have any HT cells; one had residual carcinoma after radiotherapy and 3 had recurrences between 18 months and 4 years.

The concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured immediately after induction, during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure. Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found. However, clinically, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adrenocorticotropic Hormone 2)Anesthesia, Inhalation 3)Catecholamines 4)Child 5)Child, Preschool 6)Halothane 7)Hormones 8)Human 9)Hydrocortisone 10)Infant 11)Midazolam 12)Postoperative Period 13)Premedication 14)Pulmonary Gas Exchange 15)Respiration 16)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 17)Surgery, Operative.",

Distal yellow-brown discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, nail plate thickening, and splinter hemorrhages indicate a diagnosis of type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris rather than psoriasis, while onycholysis (particularly marginal), salmon patches, small pits, and larger indentations of the nail plate indicate a diagnosis of psoriasis. Histology demonstrated that a nail biopsy would be a useful diagnostic procedure if nails were involved in isolation but provided no additional diagnostic features to those found from biopsy specimens of involved skin in the two conditions. The similarity in nail morphology between the type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris patients and five patients with chronic erythroderma resulting from Sezary syndrome indicated that these changes may represent a nonspecific reaction pattern that may result from prolonged erythema of the proximal nail bed and matrix. The rough nails (trachyonychia) described in advanced Sezary syndrome were not observed in any of our patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Anticoagulants",

Projected coronary arteriograms were digitized into 512 X 512 pixel mode and percent stenosis was calculated by comparing background-corrected videodensitometric values over stenotic and normal segments. Subjects underwent repeat coronary arteriography because of worsening symptoms of angina or heart failure; subjects with renal failure, coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac transplant were excluded. Clinical variables determined at the time of the first arteriogram included age, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and presence or absence of cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean interval between arteriograms was 29.3 months. Overall progression of coronary stenosis was observed in 40 of the 44 subjects; the mean progression at 24 months was 39% (90% confidence interval, 33 to 45%) and at 36 months was 48% (40 to 56%). The degree of overall progression was related to the length of time between arteriograms (F = 5.81, p less than 0.05) and to serum cholesterol level (F = 4.37, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that using an accurate, quantitative method, it is possible to measure progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis within 2 to 3 years of the initial arteriogram. Serum cholesterol appears to be an important determinant of disease progression. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Child, Preschool",

Endogenous secretion of cortisol was suppressed with dexamethasone. A 24 h absorption test was performed on nine children. In six, percutaneous absorption was detected. The highest serum cortisol level was reached within the first 6 h. A 4 h absorption test was developed on the basis of the 24 h test. This short absorption test was performed on nine children, and in eight of them absorption of hydrocortisone was detected. The rise of serum cortisol ranged from 98 to 2669 nmol/l. The 2 h ACTH test was performed to evaluate the effect of previous treatment with topical glucocorticoids. Suppressed adrenocortical function was found in five of 13 children, and was associated significantly with high post-application serum cortisol levels.

Samples were subjected to crossed immunoelectrophoresis into homologous antiserum through an intermediate gel containing antibody to whole human serum to screen out serum derived components. A major antigen, designated X, which seems to be of epithelial origin but is not a keratin, was identified in keratocyst fluids. X resolves as two bands on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with molecular weights of 81 K and 89 K and its major antigenic epitope is associated with disulphide bonds. Of the cysts studied to date, antigen X has been found consistently and exclusively in fluids from keratocysts; its presence and detection is independent of total soluble protein concentration and thus offers real potential as a reliable marker for preoperative diagnosis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acidosis, Renal Tubular 2)Amiloride 3)Comparative Study",

Lymphedema was first noticed in the patient at 3 years of age, and pleural effusions developed 7 years later. Thoracentesis demonstrated that the right pleural fluid was yellow, clear, and had the composition of lymph. The left pleural fluid was milky and had a higher triglyceride and lymphocyte content than the right pleural fluid. Complete removal of pleural fluid transiently increased total lung capacity to a maximum of 52% predicted. Strict dietary management with a low-fat and high-protein diet resulted in a transient partial reversal of circulating lymphopenia and low T cell concentration. This was accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte and T cell concentration in the pleural fluid. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from pleural fluid synthesized increased amounts of DNA, and added mitogens or antigens further increased DNA synthesis. Dietary therapy had a minimal effect on this DNA synthesis. Despite circulating hypogammaglobulinemia, normal antibody activity was detected. The proportion of B cells in pleural fluid was greater than that in the circulation, and dietary therapy did not alter this difference. Pulmonary physiology improved during the initial 9-month period of diet therapy, but then the rate of fluid accumulation increased, causing respiratory compromise. Stability was achieved by a right-sided pleurodesis, followed 18 months later by a left pleurodesis with the addition of a shunt to provide internal lymph drainage. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adipose Tissue 2)Adult 3)Body Composition",

On the other hand, the balance response was severely compromised in half of the individuals with a history of falls. Experience with the Postural Stress Test suggests it will predict those elderly individuals with a tendency to fall as well as provide a simple mechanism for studying the balance response in the elderly. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Age Factors 3)Education, Premedical",

All patients were without documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) before the investigation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in two patients on day 5, but in nine on day 24 after infarction. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as was the change in the distribution ratio of induced sustained ventricular arrhythmia from day 5 to day 24 (p less than 0.05). The types of arrhythmia induced on day 24 were sustained ventricular tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 207 ms in six cases (five monomorphic, one polymorphic), and ventricular fibrillation in three cases. These nine patients did not differ from the remaining nine patients in maximal serum creatine kinase, infarct site, number of stenosed coronary arteries, global left ventricular ejection fraction (47 +/- 7% versus 46 +/- 10%) and results of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring, but they had a significantly shorter right ventricular effective refractory period (223 +/- 10 ms versus 259 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.05).

The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave's syndrome with \"atypical\" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Alcohol Drinking 2)Case Report 3)Emergencies 4)Esophageal Diseases 5)Human 6)Male 7)Middle Age 8)Rupture, Spontaneous 9)Syndrome 10)Vomiting",

            "input": "Abstract: The mechanism of the increased renal clearance of amylase and the amylase to creatinine clearance ratio (CAM/CCR) in acute pancreatitis remains controversial with both renal tubular dysfunction and altered glomerular permeability being invoked as explanations. To differentiate between these mechanisms, we investigated the quantity and character of protein excretion in 10 patients with pancreatitis. For a short period of time, seven of 10 patients had mild proteinuria with a mean protein excretion rate of 230 +/- 154 mg/24 hr. Proteinuria decreased in 9/9 survivors to 17 +/- 18 mg/24 hr. Albumin excretion rate initially was minimally increased in 10/10 patients with a mean of 61 +/- 40 mg/24 hr, decreasing during recovery in 8/9 survivors to 10.9 +/- 10.4 mg/24 hr (P less than 0.01). Electrophoresis of urine obtained during the acute phase consistently showed a low molecular weight proteinuria pattern that cleared with recovery. Twenty-one of 22 urinary samples with an elevated CAM/CCR had a low molecular weight protein pattern. All the above findings can be explained by alterations in renal tubular reabsorption of proteins without changes in glomerular permeability. In 2/4 patients a low molecular weight protein was present in urine specimens from the acute phase that was not present in highly concentrated urine specimens from the recovery period. This raises the possibility that an abnormal low molecular weight protein enters the serum in acute pancreatitis, which, after glomerular filtration, produces the renal tubular malfunction found in acute pancreatitis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Evolution 3)Female",

To identify angiographic characteristics of coronary stenoses that may affect the incidence of these complications, the diagnostic pre-PTCA coronary angiograms of 38 consecutive patients (group I) undergoing emergency coronary surgery for dissection or occlusion were reviewed and compared with the angiograms of a random sample of 38 patients (stratified for left anterior descending and right coronary arteries) from a group of 1151 who did not need emergency coronary surgery (group II). Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered \"complicated\" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS). Complicated angiographic morphology of coronary stenosis may represent a risk factor for dissection or occlusion. Therefore, although the predictive value of these findings is low, detailed evaluation of angiographic morphology of coronary stenoses may improve patient selection and reduce complication rates of PTCA. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Angioplasty, Transluminal 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Disease 4)Coronary Vessels 5)Emergencies 6)Human 7)Prognosis 8)Time Factors.",

It is a tapered V-shaped nail made of malleable stainless steel, which provides rigid fracture fixation. Torsional stress is resisted because of its triflanged shape. It may be introduced closed, using the image intensifier. Two groups of patients were evaluated: Group I was treated with the Inyo nail and Group II was treated by the Association For the Study of Internal Fixation (ASIF) technique. Eighty-five percent of the patients in Group I were rated as good, compared with 63% in Group II. There was significantly less morbidity and complications in Group I. Several factors must be observed in the treatment of ankle fractures. Stress radiographs must be obtained intraoperative. Surgery may be indicated in unstable supination lateral rotation Type II injuries, if these occur in patients with high physical demands. Anatomic reduction of the lateral malleolus must be obtained. Early weight-bearing and motion produces the best result. Late reconstruction of malunions can be accomplished using the Inyo nail. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Ankle Joint 3)Bone Nails 4)Follow-Up Studies 5)Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary 6)Fractures 7)Human.",

            "input": "Abstract: Two systems for measuring embryo development in vitro were evaluated. One was a 1-4 scale based on a subjective evaluation of embryo quality (EQ) from microscopic appearance. In addition, a formula for scoring embryo growth rate in vitro was developed. The embryo development rating (EDR) was based on the ratio between the time at which embryos were observed at a particular stage after insemination and the time at which they would be expected to reach that stage in a hypothetical \"ideal\" growth rate with a cell cycle length of 11.9 hr. Using this scoring system, \"normally\" growing embryos scored 100. This approach was aimed at partially normalizing the data and allowed all embryos to be analyzed similarly regardless of the time of observation. Analysis of 1539 embryo replacements resulting in 232 clinical pregnancies showed that both EDR and embryo-quality scores were of value in predicting success, with clinical pregnancy most likely to eventuate from a combination of moderate to good EQ scores (2-4) coupled with average or above-average growth rates (EDR scores from 90 to 129). Poor-quality and very slowly or very rapidly growing embryos were underrepresented in cycles that proceeded to pregnancy. These inferences were based on all embryos transferred (mean, 2.73 per transfer cycle), and they were substantiated by an analysis of 33 pregnancies resulting from replacement of a single embryo and from 18 pregnancies in which all embryos scored the same with both systems. EQ and EDR were significantly associated with each other and together provide a valuable guide in predicting pregnancy, in selecting embryos for freezing, and in monitoring day-to-day performance in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) program. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Germany, West 3)Human.",

Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Child 3)Electromyography 4)Female 5)Human 6)Male 7)Middle Age 8)Movement 9)Muscle Spasticity 10)Muscles 11)Reflex, Abnormal 12)Reflex, Stretch 13)Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. 14)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear. It is speculated that the charged gold particles are not completely coated by the stabilizing protein, allowing for an electrostatic interaction with charged proteins in sections of cells. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Africa 2)Human 3)Models, Genetic",

Only stenoses of less than 70% that were visualized in nearly identical projections on both angiograms were evaluated. Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001). Based on this measurement and its standard deviation of progression of coronary disease in this patient subset with relatively benign disease, it is estimated that 470 patients per group would be required for an interventional study to demonstrate a 33% reduction in disease progression (207 patients for 50% reduction) at a 95% confidence level and 90% power. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cineradiography 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Disease 4)Coronary Vessels 5)Evaluation Studies 6)Follow-Up Studies 7)Heart Catheterization 8)Human 9)Image Processing, Computer-Assisted 10)Methods 11)Random Allocation 12)Retrospective Studies 13)Risk 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 16)Time Factors.",

The skin of normal guinea pigs failed to develop any cutaneous changes after inoculation with either dead spores or mycelia. In contrast, guinea pigs that had recovered from a T. mentagrophytes infection reacted to topically applied spores by producing pustules but failed to develop pustules either grossly or microscopically when inoculated with mycelia. Because differences in the activation of C' and the subsequent generation of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant, C5a, might account for our in vivo findings, we measured the amount of C5a activated in vitro when serum was incubated with equivalent amounts of spores or mycelia. Spores consistently activated more C' to C5a than mycelia, although each could activate serum C'. The results support previous studies that show a direct correlation between the clinical manifestations of a dermatophytic infection and the development of immunity against the dermatophyte. Furthermore, the data suggest that a dermatophyte's predominant morphology during an infection may play a critical role in producing pustules by activating C' and chemoattracting PMNs into the fungus-laden stratum corneum. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Health Education 3)Human",

            "input": "Abstract: We have isolated a syngeneic monoclonal antibody (HepSS-1) reactive to a murine methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, Meth-A. HepSS-1 also bound to a wide variety of established and fresh normal cells derived from not only mice but also other species such as human, monkey, rat, hamster, and chicken. Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types of GAG. From the binding analysis of HepSS-1 to various modified HS-GAG and whale omega-heparin, it is additionally suggested that HepSS-1 recognizes an epitope closely related to O-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine. We found that NIH 3T3 cells expressed more HepSS-1 epitopes at a low cell density than at confluency and in G2 + M than in G1, whereas NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Kirsten-ras oncogene or SV-40 expressed high levels of HepSS-1 epitopes and ceased to show the density-dependent change in the amount of HepSS-1 epitopes. These observations were also reproduced by using NIH 3T3 cells transformed with a temperature sensitive Kirsten murine sarcoma virus maintained at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. Thus HepSS-1 is a first monoclonal antibody to HS-GAG and seems to be useful to elucidate changes in cell surface HS-GAG in normal cell growth and cell transformation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Costs and Cost Analysis 2)Human 3)Hypertension",

Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Comparative Study 2)Death, Sudden 3)Electrocardiography 4)Follow-Up Studies 5)Heart Ventricle 6)Human 7)Membrane Potentials 8)Monitoring, Physiologic 9)Myocardial Infarction 10)Prognosis 11)Prospective Studies 12)Risk 13)Stroke Volume 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Tachycardia 16)Time Factors 17)Ventricular Fibrillation",

The disease is frequently characterized by cardiac, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. As hyperthyroidism is readily amenable to effective treatment that can improve the quality of life, the clinical suspicion of this disease is always indicated and exclusion of this diagnosis should always be pursued. Recognizing the admittedly great difficulty in making, or even suspecting, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly, our rule is to test for hyperthyroidism in essentially all geriatric patients presenting chronic systemic symptoms or signs. On the other hand, we do not recommend community-wide screening of persons over 60 for hyperthyroidism. Community-wide screening falls far below the break-even point in cost-benefit analysis. The most sensible detector of hyperthyroidism now widely available is the serum free T3 index (FT3I), but it may be falsely normal because of the effect of systemic illness on extrathyroidal T4-to-T3 conversion. The advent of ultrasensitive methods for TSH may change these statements considerably. It may become the single screening procedure for both hyper- and hypothyroidism. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Alcohol Drinking 2)Birth Weight 3)Fathers",

In addition, the influence of age on morphometric dimensions and the soft tissue cover was tested. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that nasal height and nasal length are best predicted by the dimensions of the skull, whereas nasal depth and the thickness of the soft tissues is greatly influenced by age. In males, over 50% of the variance of nasal height and nasal length were accounted for by the height of the bony nose and the prominence of the ossa nasalia, and in females it was about 40%. Although the thickness of the soft tissue is dependent on exogenous factors, such as nutrition, mimicry, and so forth, the dimensions of the bony nose apparently also influence the skin depths to some extent. High and prominent noses were found to have a thinner layer of soft tissue over the nasal bones than short and less prominent ones. It thus seems as if there is a tendency of the soft tissue cover to adjust to disharmonies of the bony profile. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accident Prevention 2)Accidents 3)Human",

After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \"patchiness,\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Circulation 4)Coronary Disease 5)Dogs 6)Drug Screening 7)Female 8)Human 9)Male 10)Microspheres 11)Myocardial Infarction 12)Myocardium 13)Necrosis 14)Recombinant Proteins 15)Superoxide Dismutase 16)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Blacks 2)Education, Medical 3)South Africa",

            "input": "Abstract: The possible role of prostaglandins in mediating large coronary artery vasodilation by nitrates was investigated by quantitative magnification coronary angiography. The effects of aspirin (1 g systemically and 100 mg intracoronary) in preventing large coronary artery vasodilation induced by intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate was investigated in 16 patients. Of these, 5 received 0.3 mg (Group 1A) and 11 received 3 mg (Group 1B) intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate, before and 15 minutes after aspirin. Relative to control, 0.3 mg isosorbide dinitrate induced a 19 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01) and 19.5 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01) increase in coronary diameter before and after aspirin, respectively (p = NS). Changes after 3 mg isosorbide were 23 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01) and 26.5 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01), respectively, before and after aspirin (p = NS). In 10 additional patients (Group 2), the effect of the same dose of aspirin on rest coronary artery tone was assessed: changes relative to control were 0.9 +/- 5.5% (p = NS) minutes after aspirin. The intracoronary administration of 3 mg isosorbide dinitrate produced a 24.7 +/- 11% increase in coronary diameter (p = NS versus pre- and postaspirin isosorbide in Group 1B). Urinary 6-ketoprostaglandin-F1 alpha values in urine samples collected in the 8 hours before and the 8 hours after the study in five patients in Group 1B and five patients of Group 2, revealed a 36 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) reduction in excretion of prostacyclin (p less than 0.01). These data rule out a role for prostaglandins both in mediating dilation of large coronary arteries by nitrates and in affecting their vascular tone at rest. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Angiography 2)Computers 3)Contrast Media",

Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Blood Platelets 3)Cattle 4)Fibrin 5)Fibrinogen 6)Heart Valve Prosthesis 7)Indium 8)Iodine Radioisotopes 9)Radioisotopes 10)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 11)Thrombosis 12)Time Factors 13)Tropolone",

To assess effects of antihypertensive therapy on the heart, left ventricular mass (determined by echocardiography) and rapid left ventricular filling rate (determined by radionuclide ventriculography) were compared before and after 6 months of treatment of 16 patients. Nitrendipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) was given alone or in combination with either propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide, or both, and significantly reduced blood pressure (156/103 +/- 12/7 to 137/89 +/- 10/6 mm Hg). In 6 of the 16 patients, left ventricular mass decreased by more than 10% (270 +/- 95 to 193 +/- 47 g, p less than 0.01); in the same patients, left ventricular filling rate increased (2.03 +/- 0.35 to 2.30 +/- 0.45 end-diastolic counts/s [EDC/s], p less than 0.01). In the one patient whose left ventricular mass increased (137 to 195 g), left ventricular filling rate decreased from 2.01 to 1.78 EDC/s. In the remaining nine patients who had no change in left ventricular mass, there was no significant changes in left ventricular filling. The changes in ventricular mass and filling could not be related to the extent of change in blood pressure or heart rate. These data suggest that regression of left ventricular mass during antihypertensive therapy with nitrendipine is accompanied by improved diastolic function. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Ear Ossicles 2)Ear, Middle 3)Human",

            "input": "Abstract: This study investigates the hypothesis that, as a consequence of Parkinson's disease, disturbed caudate outflow will lead to deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, the cortical focus of caudatofugal signals. Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. Forty nondemented parkinsonian patients were drawn from a pool of 100 consecutive patients and matched with 40 normal control subjects according to age, education, IQ, and sex. All patients were quantitatively rated on neurological indices of disease. Neuropsychological assessment of the patient and normal groups included tests of general intelligence, psychomotor skills, memory, visuospatial and executive functions. No global cognitive decline was observed in the parkinsonian group. Moreover, memory and visuospatial abilities were generally intact. A small cluster of deficits emerged, interpreted as reflecting impairment in the ability to spontaneously generate efficient strategies when relying on self-directed task-specific planning. In addition, several tests thought to be sensitive to frontal lobe function distinguished patients with symptoms strongly lateralized to the right versus left side of the body. Deficits in strategic planning were later investigated in relation to severity of disease and to patient attributes including IQ and age, both of which were relevant to performance on specific tasks. Results were compared with previous investigations in parkinsonian patients and discussed from the perspective of both animal and human studies involving damage to the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. As the prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in self-directed behavioural planning, the validity of an outflow model in predicting the consequences of caudate nucleus dysfunction was supported. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Aged, 80 and over 4)Cognition 5)Corpus Striatum 6)Female 7)Frontal Lobe 8)Human 9)Laterality 10)Male 11)Memory 12)Mental Processes 13)Middle Age 14)Neuropsychological Tests 15)Parkinson Disease 16)Psychomotor Performance 17)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years.

Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Brain 3)Case Report 4)Child 5)Corpus Callosum 6)Female 7)Human 8)Male 9)Motor Skills 10)Neural Pathways 11)Neurologic Examination 12)Neuropsychological Tests 13)Seizures 14)Stereognosis 15)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 16)Touch",

On days 2, 3, and 4, after baseline spirometry, active and placebo ascorbic acid (2 gm) was administered orally, double-blind, according to a 4.3.1 two-treatment crossover study design. One hour later, spirometry was performed, and PC20 was reassessed. We found no significant changes in FEV1 and FVC after ascorbic acid as compared with placebo administration. There was no difference between PC20 on days 2, 3, and 4 and by standardizing for the four PC20 results obtained on day 1.

Age was correlated strongly with testosterone and androstenedione, and moderately with DHEA-S and estradiol levels in both races. However, only in white boys was age consistently related to VLDL cholesterol (positively), HDL cholesterol (negatively), and apo A-I (negatively). Overall, testosterone was associated inversely with HDL cholesterol and apo A-I in white boys, while progesterone was related positively to apo A-I in both races after adjusting for age and adiposity. However, these relationships were found to differ with age. Partial correlations between levels of sex hormones and lipoproteins adjusted for age and adiposity showed no associations in the 11 to 12 year age group in boys of either race.

This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Catheterization 2)Human 3)Male 4)Neoplasms 5)Peritoneum 6)Pleural Effusion",

In the present study, other peripheral blood cell types were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for the presence of C3dg binding activity. Specific uptake of C3dg occurred with neutrophils, platelets, and B lymphocytes, but not with eosinophils or T lymphocytes. Monocytes, contained within a mixed cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets, also bound C3dg, whereas purified monocytes did not. Binding of 125I-labeled glutaraldehyde-cross-linked C3dg to platelets was saturable, with an average of 1940 C3dg molecules bound per platelet at saturation (n = 8), ranging in number from 660 to 3930 molecules bound. Activation of platelets with thrombin did not consistently cause an increase in the expression of CR4 sites. 125I-C3dg binding to platelets was competitively inhibited equally well by unlabeled C3dg and iC3b, and approximately fourfold less well by C3b. The addition of platelets to elutriated monocytes generated C3dg binding activity on these cells by the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes. Thus, the CR4 on platelets accounted for the C3dg binding activity initially observed with partially purified monocytes. The adherent property of platelets may enable them to confer on certain other cell types the ability to localize C3dg-coated immune complexes or particles. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Ethics, Medical 2)Female 3)Human",

Infants younger than 1 year of age had a significantly greater frequency of undifferentiated sarcoma, 18% versus 7% in older children (P less than 0.005). Infants also had a significantly greater proportion of cancers with botryoid pathology, 10% versus 4% in older children (P less than 0.005). When reviewed by the newly proposed IRS cytopathologic classification, there was no difference in pathologic types between the two age groups. Infants younger than 1 year of age had a higher rate of bladder-prostate-vagina primary tumor sites than older children, 24% versus 10% (P less than 0.05). In addition, infants tended to receive less of the prescribed doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy than older children, and to develop more toxicity to treatment than older children. Despite these differences, the overall survival curve for the two age groups appears to be similar. In contrast to Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma, in which age (less than 1 year) is a favorable prognostic factor, age does not appear to be an important prognostic factor in rhabdomyosarcoma. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antineoplastic Agents 2)Combined Modality Therapy 3)Female 4)Human 5)Infant 6)Infant, Newborn 7)Male 8)Rhabdomyosarcoma 9)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

In the present study, I examined whether anhidrosis, a cardinal feature of CST, is present in the putative mouse sex-linked model, Tabby. The results demonstrate that whereas normal mice perspire on the volar and plantar surfaces of their paws, hemizygous Ta/Y male mice show anhidrosis and absence of sweat glands, as do human hemizygous male sufferers of CST. This result is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that Ta is homologous to the gene for CST. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)DNA 2)Models, Molecular 3)Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",

The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration in vitreous fluid was more than 20 times higher in the cold exposed animals than in controls (44.2 +/- 9.2 versus 2.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL). Autolysis alone caused an increase to 33.5 +/- 7.7 ng/mL, and freezing alone to 13.4 +/- 5.3 ng/mL. The highest values were in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. Adrenaline (A) concentration in the vitreous fluid increased fourfold (3.9 +/- 1.5 versus 0.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL) in cold exposure and twofold as a result of autolysis. Dopamine (DA) concentration in vitreous fluid was elevated only in the group with exposure, freezing, and autolysis. The increase of NA concentration in urine was fivefold during the whole exposure (from 19.4 +/- 6.9 to 109 +/- 57.3 ng/mL), but A was increased by twentyfold (from 10 +/- 5.1 to 213.2 +/- 168.7 ng/mL), whereas DA concentration did not change. The increase of average excretion of NA to urine was eightfold during the first 6 h of exposure, and that of A tenfold. According to the present results, elevated concentrations of catecholamines in the vitreous fluid and urine can be used as a diagnostic aid for hypothermia death. Concerning the values of noradrenaline in the vitreous, the increase as a result of autolysis must be taken in account when interpreting the results. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)California 2)Crime 3)Fraud",

Gastric contents and urine were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, and nasal swabs, blood, and urine were tested for the combination of cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine by quantitative radioimmunoassay. A total of seventy-two deaths in Pima County from 1982 to 1984 have involved cocaine. Seventy percent of these have occurred in the last fifteen months. Marked variation in the individual response to cocaine compared to the blood concentration of cocaine/metabolite was noted. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Brain 2)Brain Mapping 3)Human",

Although methods of ascertainment are not standardised, regional differences and changes with time are present for each of these statistics. Mortality has declined, whereas prevalence and hospital discharge rates have increased owing in part to the improved survival but also to better case ascertainment. The gradient in prevalence seen between Southern England (63/10(5)), Northern England and Northern Ireland (76-79/10(5)), Wales (c. 113/10(5)), North-East Scotland (155/10(5)) and the Orkneys (258/10(5)) can in part be attributed to varying methods of ascertainment but correlates with regional differences in the frequency of HLA-DR2 in normal individuals (21-50%). However no HLA-DR2 association is observed in parts of Scotland, where the prevalence is the highest in the United Kingdom, because HLA-DR2 and linked genes occur in up to 50% of the normal population from these areas. If the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is multifactorial the frequency of the disease will increase where susceptibility genes are common because the probability of concurrence of the remaining critical events is high; conversely when each aetiological agent is infrequent the chance of them all occurring in the same individual and therefore incidence of the disease are both lower. The fall in incidence observed in the Orkney Islands, possibly reflecting decline in an exogenous agent interacting with susceptibility factors, is consistent with this multifactorial hypothesis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antibodies, Monoclonal 2)Patents",

Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Anti-Inflammatory Agents 3)Arthritis, Rheumatoid 4)Female 5)Human 6)Male 7)Middle Age 8)Osteoarthritis 9)Peptic Ulcer",

This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Dogs 3)Heart Arrest 4)Heart Massage 5)Hemodynamics 6)Human 7)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

            "input": "Abstract: Because mast cells (MCs) in skin of atopic dogs are heterogeneous with respect to tissue fixation and staining properties, we determined the effect of antigen on each type of MC in vivo. Skin biopsies were done in anesthetized, ragweed-sensitized dogs before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after intradermal injections of ragweed antigen (n = 5) or glycerin diluent (n = 4). In each case, one biopsy specimen was fixed with formalin, and a second specimen from an adjacent abdominal site was fixed with basic lead acetate. In sections stained with Alcian blue, 49.7% more MCs (p less than 0.05) were detected in tissue fixed with basic lead acetate (\"typical\" plus \"atypical\" MCs: 2916 +/- 581/mm3; mean +/- SEM) than in tissue fixed with formalin (\"typical\" MCs: 1955 +/- 537/mm3). After antigen, the number of \"typical\" MCs detectable in tissue sections progressively decreased during the 24-hour period, whereas the number of \"atypical\" MCs was lowest at 1 hour and had increased at 24 hours. After diluent, MC numbers did not change significantly over time. A late-phase response (LPR), detected clinically as induration and edema, was present 6 hours after antigen in four of five dogs, but LPR was not detected after diluent. The size of LPR was correlated (r = 0.85; p less than 0.05) with the decrease in the number of \"typical\" MCs at 6 hours. We conclude that the response of the \"typical\" and \"atypical\" MC to antigen in vivo differs markedly. The \"atypical\" MCs participate in the early, acute response to antigen, and the \"typical\" MCs may be associated with the development of the LPR. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adaptation, Physiological 2)Adult 3)Female",

Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic 2)Arrhythmia 3)California 4)Electrocardiography 5)Emergencies 6)Emergency Service, Hospital 7)Female 8)Human 9)Length of Stay 10)Male 11)Prognosis 12)Retrospective Studies 13)Tachycardia, Sinus",

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non-pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aircraft 3)Altitude 4)Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous 5)Conjunctiva 6)Female 7)Human 8)Male 9)Monitoring, Physiologic 10)Regression Analysis 11)Transportation of Patients",

Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Bone Marrow 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool 4)Drug Administration Routes 5)Human 6)Infant 7)Needles.",

However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware. A System 8 concept is shown in Figure 14. The System 8 hardware will include a thermal salt package capable of providing completely untethered circulatory support for a nominal 8-h period. Recharge will be accomplished with a transcutaneous transformer in 1 h. Thermal management problems become minimal, with an average energy input of 15.8 W (peak of 24.9 W).

The ulnar nerve was stimulated with trains of four supramaximal pulses of 0.2 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz at intervals of 20 s. The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade. During onset of blockade by alcuronium, the mechanical response was depressed to a significantly greater extent compared with the ECAP. This difference was not observed during antagonism with neostigmine. The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group.

In every instance there was cross-reactivity between the positive patients' sera and the heterologous non-dermatophyte antigen. Using crossed and intermediate gel immunoelectrophoresis it was found that cytoplasmic extracts of H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum showed 34 and 41 precipitin peaks respectively, most of which were shared by both organisms. No cross-reactions were observed between the non-dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts and hyperimmune animal antisera raised to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans. Exoantigens prepared from the two non-dermatophytes showed similar cross-reactivity between the two species. It appears that H. toruloidea and S. hyalinum are very similar in antigenic structure, a finding which lends support to the view that they may be closely related. They are also antigenically distinct from other pathogenic fungi which commonly infect skin, a fact which may be useful in their cultural identification as well as their recognition in tissue specimens. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antibodies, Fungal 2)Antigens, Fungal 3)Counterimmunoelectrophoresis 4)Cross Reactions 5)Dermatomycoses 6)Deuteromycetes 7)Human 8)Hyphomycetes 9)Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional.",

When indomethacin was applied immediately after irradiation, UVR (ultraviolet radiation) dose-dependent suppression of erythema was demonstrated for both wavelengths until 36 h after irradiation when both indomethacin and control gel base-treated sites were equally erythematous. Suppression of erythema also occurred when application of indomethacin was delayed until 24 h after irradiation, showing that for both wavelengths prostaglandin synthesis remains increased throughout this period. The degree of suppression at any time, however, was no greater than that achieved by a single application immediately after irradiation, indicating that the eventual equal erythema of indomethacin and gel base-treated sites was not due to tachyphylaxis or inadequate dosage. Construction of dose-response curves for the indomethacin-responsive and indomethacin-unresponsive components of erythema shows that in human skin the difference in erythemal response to UVB and UVC radiation is not due to the formation of different mediators at these wavelengths. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Administration, Topical 2)Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation 3)Erythema 4)Human 5)Indomethacin 6)Models, Biological 7)Skin 8)Ultraviolet Rays",

We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Anemia, Macrocytic 2)Animal 3)Bone Marrow 4)Cell Differentiation 5)Cell Division 6)Colony-Forming Units Assay 7)Growth Inhibitors 8)Growth Substances 9)Hematopoiesis 10)Mice 11)Mice, Mutant Strains 12)Radiation, Ionizing.",

Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \"desensitization\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antibodies, Monoclonal 2)Blood Platelets 3)Calcium 4)Epinephrine 5)Fibrinogen 6)Human 7)Magnesium 8)Platelet Aggregation 9)Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins 10)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 12)Time Factors.",

Most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections, but a large proportion of lymphocytes from WAS patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli. A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli. These morphological criteria were used to diagnose WAS from the cord blood lymphocytes of one \"at-risk\" patient. Thus, WAS is the first primary immunodeficiency in which morphological abnormalities have been identified that can aid in diagnosis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cell Membrane 2)Fetal Blood 3)Human 4)Infant, Newborn 5)Lymphocytes 6)Microscopy, Electron, Scanning 7)Microvilli 8)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 9)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 10)Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome",

We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Erythrocyte Deformability 2)Erythrocyte Membrane 3)Erythrocytes 4)Heinz Bodies 5)Human 6)Membrane Proteins 7)Microscopy, Electron 8)Molecular Weight 9)Oxidation-Reduction 10)Phenylhydrazines 11)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 12)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Neuraminidase-inaccessible, ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment, was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line. Neuraminidase treatment of 125I-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins (SMGs) from wt HL-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with RA- and 6TG-resistant cells. However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism. Further studies are required to determine if hyposialylation of cryptic, neuraminidase-inaccessible sites has functional significance. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cell Differentiation 2)Cell Division 3)Cell Line 4)Dimethyl Sulfoxide 5)Drug Resistance 6)Granulocytes 7)Human 8)Neuraminidase 9)Sialic Acids 10)Sialoglycoproteins 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 12)Thioguanine 13)Tretinoin",

The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Blood Proteins 3)Cytotoxicity, Immunologic 4)Drug Synergism 5)Human 6)Hydrogen Peroxide 7)Kinetics 8)Mice 9)Neoplasms, Experimental 10)Neutrophils 11)Rabbits 12)Species Specificity 13)Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. 14)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Eighty-four patients took MTX in a median dose of 7.5 mg/week whilst 55 received purine analogues, 100 mg/day (median). By 12 months, 19.3% of patients had ceased MTX due to toxicity, compared with 29.3% for purine analogues. Toxicity severe enough to warrant stopping therapy was uncommon after 8 months with either drug. At 12 months 61.5% of the MTX patients had achieved defined criteria of improvement compared with 25.6% for the purine analogues (p less than 0.05). The number of patients improving on purine analogues did not increase substantially after 6 months, whereas the number improving with MTX continued to 12 months.

Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin. The antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-S2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle. Serotonin is a potential neurotransmitter in lower urinary tract smooth muscle, but its importance in micturition physiology and pathophysiology is unknown. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Bladder 3)Cyproheptadine 4)Dose-Response Relationship, Drug 5)Female 6)Human 7)In Vitro 8)Ketanserin 9)Methysergide 10)Muscle Contraction 11)Muscle, Smooth 12)Serotonin 13)Serotonin Antagonists 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Swine 16)Urethra",

Limb preference and efficiency were evaluated, as well as the relationship between limb use, spontaneous, and methamphetamine-induced rotation bias, both preoperatively and postoperatively. To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively. The similarity in the deficits following sensorimotor cortex lesions and basal ganglia lesions suggests that skilled forelimb use depends upon a shared neural organization within the two systems. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Corpus Striatum 3)Dopamine 4)Female 5)Forelimb 6)Methamphetamine 7)Motor Cortex 8)Psychomotor Performance 9)Rats 10)Rats, Inbred Strains 11)Stereotyped Behavior 12)Substantia Nigra 13)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Aged, 80 and over 3)Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 4)Anterior Horn Cells 5)Cell Count 6)Female 7)Human 8)Image Processing, Computer-Assisted 9)Male 10)Middle Age 11)Motor Neurons 12)Spinal Cord 13)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

In this longitudinal study, involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively, we have confirmed that fluctuations in T8+ cells occur in patients with MS and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients' spouses but not their siblings, compared with unrelated controls. The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage. Our results provide indirect evidence for the role of environmental factors in determining certain immunological abnormalities present in patients with MS and illustrate the role of family studies in determining the specificity of these changes to the disease. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Antibodies, Viral 3)Environment 4)Female 5)Human 6)Leukocyte Count 7)Longitudinal Studies 8)Male 9)Middle Age 10)Multiple Sclerosis 11)Suppressor Cells",

There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Burns, Inhalation 3)Dextrans 4)DTPA 5)Extracellular Space 6)Lung 7)Rabbits 8)Technetium",

Fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old. The average age was 31 years. Two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent. While scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study (19.4 per cent), flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns. Face and hands were the most common sites involved. Burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns. Eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals, gas explosions and electric flash. Twenty-six patients (14 per cent) suffered respiratory injury. Only one patient out of our series of 182 died.

Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Electric Injuries 3)Human 4)Lightning 5)Mice 6)Rats 7)Rats, Inbred Strains 8)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Bone Marrow 3)Chromosome Aberrations 4)Female 5)Human 6)Male 7)Middle Age 8)Myeloproliferative Disorders 9)Preleukemia 10)Prognosis 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients. However, because of its biochemical effects, further testing in combination with cycle specific agents and in larger numbers of patients with minimal prior treatment may be warranted. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Animal 3)Cats 4)Diarrhea 5)Drug Evaluation 6)Female 7)Head and Neck Neoplasms 8)Human 9)Male 10)Middle Age 11)Mitoguazone 12)Nausea 13)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 14)Vomiting",

Both patients achieved a complete remission. Patient 1 developed a massive recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes 21 months after diagnosis and treatment with right salpingo-oophorectomy alone. She received four cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 21 months from the start of chemotherapy. Patient 2 had Stage III dysgerminoma and a lymphangiogram positive for tumor in the para-aortic lymph nodes. After surgery she received three cycles of chemotherapy and is free of disease 20 months from the start of chemotherapy. Both complete remissions were documented with second-look laparotomy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic dysgerminoma and should also be considered for selected patients with Stage I disease. A literature review further supports the conclusion that additional clinical trials might expand the indications for chemotherapy in patients with this disease. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Antineoplastic Agents, Combined 4)Bleomycins 5)Case Report 6)Cisplatin 7)Dysgerminoma 8)Etoposide 9)Female 10)Human 11)Lymphatic Metastasis 12)Neoplasm Recurrence, Local 13)Ovarian Neoplasms",

The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Antibody Formation 3)Antibody-Producing Cells 4)Comparative Study 5)Female 6)Human 7)Immunity, Cellular 8)Immunoglobulins 9)Leukoplakia 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Mouth Diseases 13)Mouth Neoplasms 14)Oral Submucous Fibrosis 15)Rosette Formation 16)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

These tumors are known more for their local invasiveness rather than distant metastasis. This would appear to preclude meningeal involvement, but close proximity to multiple cranial nerves may provide an access to the meninges. Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Carcinoma 4)Case Report 5)Female 6)Head and Neck Neoplasms 7)Human 8)Male 9)Meningeal Neoplasms 10)Tomography, X-Ray Computed.",

The current investigation determined the TSA, LASA, total protein (TP), and TSA/TP values for 171 cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of metastatic disease, 102 patients with nonmalignant diseases (pathologic controls), and 42 normal individuals. Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged 4)Blood Proteins 5)Female 6)Human 7)Lipids 8)Liver Neoplasms 9)Lymphatic Metastasis 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Neoplasm Metastasis 13)Neoplasms 14)Sialic Acids 15)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 16)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Autopsy 4)Echocardiography 5)Electrocardiography 6)Female 7)Heart 8)Heart Neoplasms 9)Human 10)Male 11)Mesothelioma 12)Middle Age 13)Pleural Neoplasms 14)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Bladder Neoplasms 3)BCG Vaccine 4)Carcinoma 5)Case Report 6)False Negative Reactions 7)Female 8)Flow Cytometry 9)Human 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

The frequency of bladders without residual TCC was 23% for irradiated and 22% for nonirradiated cases.

Flat carcinoma in situ (CIS) did not respond to irradiation. At cystectomy nuclear pleomorphism was greater than at biopsy in 60% of the irradiated TCCs, whereas all nonirradiated cases retained the same grade as at biopsy.

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Coronary Disease 2)Heart Failure, Congestive 3)Heart Valve Diseases 4)Heart Ventricle 5)Human 6)Hypertension",

Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Coronary Disease 3)Female 4)Heart Failure, Congestive 5)Heart Ventricle 6)Human 7)Intraoperative Complications 8)Intraoperative Period 9)Male 10)Middle Age 11)Mitral Valve Stenosis 12)Postoperative Complications 13)Preoperative Care 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 15)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cardiopulmonary Bypass 2)Heart Failure, Congestive 3)Heart Ventricle 4)Heart-Assist Devices 5)Human 6)Intraoperative Complications 7)Lung 8)Pulsatile Flow.",

Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Blood Flow Velocity 2)Comparative Study 3)Echocardiography 4)Fetal Heart 5)Gestational Age 6)Heart Ventricle 7)Human 8)Prospective Studies 9)Reference Values 10)Stroke Volume 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Overall, the incidence of resting angina was highest at night. All pacing results were positive (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment shift) and tended to be reproducible in nine patients, whereas some or all were negative in seven. Among all positive results, ischemic thresholds at night were significantly lower than those in the morning and in the afternoon (125 +/- 3 vs 138 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 beats/min, mean +/- SEM; p less than .005). In nine patients, 19 pacing tests produced ST segment elevation, of which 13 were performed at night (68%). We conclude that patients with resting angina and severe coronary stenosis often exhibit a nocturnal decline in their ischemic threshold, which seems to facilitate development of transmural ischemia during atrial pacing. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Angina Pectoris 2)Angina, Unstable 3)Cardiac Pacing, Artificial 4)Circadian Rhythm 5)Coronary Disease 6)Coronary Vessels 7)Electrocardiography 8)Heart Atrium 9)Heart Catheterization 10)Hemodynamics 11)Human 12)Male 13)Middle Age 14)Rest.",

            "input": "Abstract: It has been shown in different groups of patients with variant angina that coronary spasm can be reproduced by physiologic maneuvers and pharmacologic agents. It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Angina Pectoris, Variant 4)Cold 5)Coronary Vasospasm 6)Coronary Vessels 7)Ergonovine 8)Exertion 9)Female 10)Histamine 11)Human 12)Hyperventilation 13)Male 14)Middle Age 15)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 16)Vasoconstriction",

Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Biopsy 3)Calcium Gluconate 4)Comparative Study 5)Dobutamine 6)Endocardium 7)Heart 8)Heart Catheterization 9)Heart Failure, Congestive 10)Hemodynamics 11)Human 12)Male 13)Middle Age 14)Myocardium 15)Radioligand Assay 16)Receptors, Adrenergic, Beta 17)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 18)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aortic Valve 2)Aortic Valve Insufficiency 3)Aortic Valve Stenosis 4)Heart Catheterization 5)Heart Valve Prosthesis 6)Hemodynamics 7)Human 8)Mitral Valve 9)Mitral Valve Insufficiency 10)Mitral Valve Stenosis 11)Postoperative Period 12)Prognosis 13)Stroke Volume 14)Systole.",

However, muscular or multiple ventricular septal defects may be difficult to diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular septal defects with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5.6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular septal defects, 18 had multiple ventricular septal defects, and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular septal defect was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular septal defect proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular septal defects, the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72% and that of two-dimensional/Doppler was 38% (100% specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular septal defects in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Child 4)Child, Preschool 5)Color 6)Comparative Study 7)Echocardiography 8)Evaluation Studies 9)Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular 10)Heart Septum 11)Heart Ventricle 12)Human 13)Infant 14)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Comparative Study 4)Electrocardiography 5)Electrodes 6)Female 7)Human 8)Male 9)Membrane Potentials 10)Microcomputers 11)Middle Age 12)Minicomputers 13)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 14)Tachycardia 15)Time Factors 16)Vectorcardiography",

            "input": "Abstract: Body surface potential maps were recorded from 140 chest leads in 25 patients affected by the idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) and in 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex. Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Arrhythmia 4)Child 5)Comparative Study 6)Computers 7)Electrocardiography 8)Electrodes 9)Female 10)Heart Ventricle 11)Human 12)Long QT Syndrome 13)Male 14)Middle Age 15)Vectorcardiography",

            "input": "Abstract: Guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site. We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cardiac Pacing, Artificial 2)Cardiopulmonary Bypass 3)Cineradiography 4)Comparative Study 5)Computers 6)Electrocardiography 7)Electrodes 8)Evaluation Studies 9)Heart Catheterization 10)Heart Ventricle 11)Human 12)Intraoperative Care 13)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 14)Tachycardia",

QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acetylprocainamide 2)Aged 3)Cardiac Pacing, Artificial 4)Dose-Response Relationship, Drug 5)Drug Evaluation 6)Electrocardiography 7)Female 8)Heart Catheterization 9)Heart Conduction System 10)Heart Ventricle 11)Human 12)Infusions, Intravenous 13)Male 14)Middle Age 15)Procainamide 16)Prospective Studies 17)Tachycardia",

Early thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase (152 patients) or with intracoronary streptokinase preceded by intravenous streptokinase (117 patients) was compared with conventional treatment (264 patients). All 533 patients were admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 hr after onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were eligible for this detailed analysis, and 245 of these were allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 243 to conventional treatment. Early angiographic examinations were performed in 212 patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy. Patency of the infarct-related artery was achieved in 181 patients (85%). Enzymatic infarct size, as measured from cumulative alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase release, was smaller in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (median 760 vs 1170 U/liter in control patients, p = .0001). Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiography before discharge from the hospital was higher after thrombolytic therapy (median 50% vs 43% in control patients, p = .0001). Three month mortality was lower in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (6% vs 14% in the control group, p = .006). With the use of multivariate regression analysis, infarct size limitation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, and three month mortality were predicted by sum of the ST segment elevation, time from onset of symptoms to admission, and Killip class at admission. Thrombolysis was most effective in patients admitted within 2 hr after onset of symptoms and in patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of 1.2 mV or more. On the other hand, no beneficial effects of streptokinase on enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular function, or mortality were observed in the subset of patients with a sum of ST segment elevation of less than 1.2 mV who were admitted between 2 and 4 hr after onset of symptoms. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Comparative Study 2)Coronary Vessels 3)Drug Evaluation 4)Electrocardiography 5)Heart Catheterization 6)Heart Ventricle 7)Hemodynamics 8)Human 9)Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase 10)Myocardial Infarction 11)Myocardium 12)Streptokinase 13)Time Factors.",

Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed. A study of the hemodynamics during and survival from prolonged resuscitation was then performed on three groups of seven dogs. Vest CPR was compared with manual CPR with either conventional (300 newtons) or high (430 newtons) sternal force. After induction of ventricular fibrillation, each technique was performed for 26 min.

            "input": "Abstract: Radiographic techniques used to quantify coronary blood flow all require bolus injection of contrast material, which markedly alters the flow being measured. Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Analysis of Variance 2)Animal 3)Blood Flow Velocity 4)Coronary Circulation 5)Dogs 6)Dose-Response Relationship, Drug 7)Flowmeters 8)Heart 9)Hemodynamics 10)Iohexol 11)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 12)Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. 13)Time Factors.",

Twenty-two dogs underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 10 dogs (group I) the LAD remained occluded for 3 hr and in the other 12 (group II) for 2 hr followed by 1 hr of reperfusion. Gd-DTPA (0.34 mM/kg) was administered to five dogs in group I at 2 hr and 5 min after occlusion and to seven dogs in group II 5 min after reperfusion. At 3 hr after ligation, the hearts were excised and imaged with spin echo and inversion recovery pulse sequences on a 0.35 Tesla magnetic resonance imager. Reperfused hearts given Gd-DTPA demonstrated a significant increase in contrast between normal and reperfused myocardium as compared with nonreperfused hearts and reperfused hearts not given Gd-DTPA. This enhancement was particularly prominent in the inversion recovery images. Studies performed in vivo in two additional dogs demonstrated similar enhancement with reperfusion with Gd-DTPA in gated spin echo images. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of reperfusion early in the course of acute infarction. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Circulation 4)Dogs 5)Drug Screening 6)DTPA 7)Gadolinium 8)In Vitro 9)Myocardial Infarction 10)Myocardium 11)Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 12)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 13)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 14)Tetrazolium Salts",

The event that compromises the cardiac status is often respiratory embarrassment, and the presenting rhythms are often bradyarrhythmias and asystole. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems have primarily an adult focus and may not be organized to manage optimally the critically ill and injured child. Data from a survey of training programs demonstrate that paramedic and EMT education in pediatric emergencies may be inadequate. Forty-one percent of the programs surveyed had less than 10 hr of pediatric training. Data suggest that EMS providers may not be equipped to manage children effectively. The Los Angeles EMS System for children is described. There are two levels of receiving facilities: Emergency Departments Approved for Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care Centers. The system is voluntary and has 85% of the hospitals in compliance with the guidelines. Early recognition of the prearrest state, improved training, and equipping of prehospital care personnel, development of EMS services for children, dissemination of an advanced pediatric life support course, as well as research in pediatric CPR may improve the outcome of resuscitation in the pediatric population. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool 4)Emergency Medical Services 5)Health Services Needs and Demand 6)Health Services Research 7)Human 8)Infant 9)Life Support Care 10)Pediatrics 11)United States.",

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Allied Health Personnel 2)Community Health Services 3)Electric Countershock 4)Emergency Medical Technicians 5)Human 6)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 7)United States.",

To overcome some of the fear and lack of involvement, better education strategies are needed. Adults learn didactic information through understanding and skills through repetition and reinforcement. Due to the fact that there is limited time that adults will commit to learning CPR, methods of simplification of the techniques need to be used so that there can be sufficient repetition and reinforcement. Teaching two-rescuer CPR to lay rescuers should not routinely be done. Most adults, particularly those around high-risk individuals, should learn one-rescuer CPR. Infant resuscitation should be taught predominantly to those around small children. Methods of reinforcement through the mass media should be attempted on a routine basis. Whenever possible the courses should be spread over a period of time to allow for repetition and reinforcement, thereby maximizing learning. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be widely taught to health professionals. ACLS instruction needs to be spread over time, whenever logistically possible, to enhance learning and retention. Good, validated examinations are needed and should be routinely rotated. Better methods of evaluation are needed to look at the benefit of these types of programs and to improve the cost-benefit ratio. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Educational Measurement 2)Human 3)Life Support Care 4)Resuscitation 5)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.",

Regardless of the cause, mechanical ventilation should begin as soon as possible and closed-chest cardiac massage should be administered when there is any question about the adequacy of cardiac output. After aspiration of either fresh or seawater, a large intrapulmonary physiologic shunt can occur, which requires aggressive mechanical ventilatory support to ensure adequate oxygenation and to return pulmonary function to normal. Near drowning is a multisystem disease and, while abnormalities of the lung and brain have been emphasized, definitive therapy must be tailored to each patient and must address all of the patient's needs. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Drowning 2)Human 3)Methods.",

Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Electric Countershock 2)Emergency Medical Services 3)Human 4)Life Support Care 5)Resuscitation 6)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 7)United States.",

Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure \"thoracic pump\" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder. The latter technique was associated with successful defibrillation and recovery after more than 30 min of circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation. Preliminary studies in a primate preparation indicate that this technique might be useful for prolonged circulatory support in man when defibrillation is not initially available or successful. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cough 3)Dogs 4)Human 5)Resuscitation 6)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 7)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..",

Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Airway Obstruction 2)Foreign Bodies 3)Human 4)Methods.",

Recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting a need to change the present American Heart Association standards for artificial ventilation. These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Heart Arrest 2)Human 3)Respiration, Artificial 4)Respiratory Insufficiency",

Defibrillation was attempted 2 min after the administration of bicarbonate or placebo. All animals were successfully defibrillated, but three of eight bicarbonate-treated and two of eight control animals died in electromechanical dissociation (p = NS). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred in three animals in each group (p = NS). Successful resuscitation was not dependent on treatment, arterial or mixed venous Pco2, or arterial or mixed venous pH but correlated strongly with coronary perfusion pressure (p less than .003). Spontaneous refibrillation occurred without relation to any identifiable variable. The gradient between diastolic aortic and right atrial pressures was 24 +/- 2 mm Hg in controls and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg in treated animals over the entire 20 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = NS). However, among animals successfully resuscitated, mean diastolic coronary perfusion pressure averaged 27 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 20 +/- 1 mm Hg among those dying in electromechanical dissociation (p less than .02). For the final 2 min of resuscitation, after drug administration, these gradients were 31 +/- 2 and 23 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively (p less than .01). Microsphere determined myocardial perfusion correlated with the diastolic aortic-right atrial perfusion pressure gradient (r = .86) and was 0.43 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g in survivors and 0.22 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g in nonsurvivors (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Bicarbonates 3)Dogs 4)Resuscitation 5)Sodium 6)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 7)Ventricular Fibrillation",

The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Allied Health Personnel 2)Electric Countershock 3)Emergency Medical Technicians 4)Human 5)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 6)United States.",

Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma.

We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cats 3)Denervation 4)Ganglia, Autonomic 5)Human 6)Nasal Mucosa 7)Neostigmine 8)Rhinitis, Vasomotor",

The antithrombin III-concentration increased to 0.56 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, reaching 1.87% of normal plasma values. The antithrombin III-portion of total protein was 0.62% in plasma and 0.79% in dialysate. The fibrinopeptide A-concentration, a specific product of thrombin action on fibrinogen was 37.1 +/- 11.8 ng/ml in plasma (normal range: less than 2.5 ng/ml) and 153.4 +/- 16.8 ng/ml in dialysate during regular CAPD. After the addition of 5000 U heparin the fibrinopeptide A-concentration in dialysate decreased to 11.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml during a 4-hour dwell time. In vitro experiments showed no remarkable inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin without antithrombin III in dialysate. We suggest that the fibrinopeptide A is produced intraperitoneally and the antithrombin III-concentration in dialysate is sufficient to inhibit the fibrin formation after acceleration by heparin. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Antithrombin III 2)Blood Proteins 3)Comparative Study 4)Female 5)Fibrin 6)Fibrinogen 7)Fibrinopeptides A 8)Heparin 9)Human 10)Male 11)Peritoneal Cavity 12)Peritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatory",

All subjects had documented progression of deformity, with an average curvature of 34 degrees. The average ages for scoliotics and 18 control subjects were 16.1 and 20.8 years, respectively. Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls. The results of this study imply, but do not localize, a neurologic deficit in scoliotic patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Elbow Joint 4)Human 5)Laterality 6)Movement 7)Muscles 8)Proprioception 9)Scoliosis",

Excellent or good results were noted in 15 of 18 quadriceps and 7 of 10 patellar tendons. Radiographic comparison with the opposite knee disclosed incongruences between the patella and the femoral groove in the tangential view and/or cranial-caudal position of the patella in the lateral view in 13 of the quadriceps tendon ruptures and seven of the patellar tendon ruptures. Patients with residual pain had patellofemoral incongruity but since two-thirds of the patients with incongruity were asymptomatic, incongruity alone may not be the cause of the symptoms. There was no positive correlation to muscular strength or range of movement. Nevertheless, exact adaptation of the patellar tendon and periarticular tissue seems necessary to obtain correct patello-femoral articulation. Reinforcement of the tendon with a wire cerclage is recommended to decrease the tension on the suture line and the consequent risk of a secondary rupture. In acute ruptures of the quadriceps tendon end-to-end sutures are sufficient. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Casts, Surgical 4)Evaluation Studies 5)Female 6)Femur 7)Human 8)Knee Injuries 9)Knee Joint 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Patella 13)Rupture 14)Tendons",

It is not known whether patella alta is an inherited or acquired trait. To investigate the relationship of patella during the adolescent growth spurt, serial orthoroentgenograms (growth study films) were retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients. Two were found in whom proximal patella migration could be correlated (r = 0.85) with femoral growth rate. This was significant at the p = 0.01 level. Girls had a higher correlation of patella height to growth rate than boys. In certain cases, patella alta is an acquired rather than inherited condition; this supports the theory that overgrowth during the growth spurt can lead to patella alta in some individuals. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Bone Diseases, Developmental 3)Dislocations 4)Female 5)Femur 6)Human 7)Knee Joint 8)Male 9)Mathematics 10)Patella 11)Retrospective Studies.",

To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)False Negative Reactions 2)Human 3)Knee Injuries 4)Knee Joint 5)Ligaments 6)Movement 7)Physical Examination 8)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't 9)Tibia",

The results of this study confirm previous reports that NSE and S100 protein are useful markers for malignant melanoma. NSE staining intensity in the cases of malignant melanoma was significantly higher than that in benign naevi (p = 0.011). Intensity of staining for S100 protein was not significantly higher in the malignant melanomas. There was, however, a significant S100 gradient when comparing superficial and deep intradermal portions of these tumours (p = 0.003). This feature was not seen in benign naevi. The greatest intensity of S100 protein staining was found in the deeper portions of the malignant melanomas. This gradient difference was not seen with staining for NSE. Although it seems that the overall intensity of staining for NSE is more effective in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions, the difference in staining intensity between the superficial and deep portions of the tumour may be the better indicator of adverse behaviour in lesions in which the diagnosis of malignancy is uncertain. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Absorption 2)Animal 3)Comparative Study",

Within an observation period of up to 8 years (mean, 63.1 months) six patients with squamous cell carcinomas and three with basal cell carcinomas were observed. Eight of the nine tumor patients had been exposed to potential carcinogens such as arsenic and/or ionizing radiation prior to PUVA treatment. Five with squamous cell carcinomas were skin type I or II; in four of the six patients with squamous cell carcinomas the tumors were located on unexposed skin areas. The mean cumulative ultraviolet A (UVA) dose in three of the six squamous cell carcinoma patients was three times as high as that in the group of nontumor patients. The other three squamous cell carcinoma patients had lower mean doses than nontumor patients, as did the three patients with basal cell carcinomas. Although the cumulative UVA dose may eventually turn out to be relevant for PUVA carcinogenesis, our present data do not sufficiently substantiate a correlation between cumulative UVA dose and squamous cell carcinoma formation in PUVA-treated patients. This report confirms that previous exposure to carcinogens appears to be the most important factor for nonmelanoma skin tumor formation in long-term PUVA patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Age Factors 3)Child",

It supports the hypothesis that tumor proximity to major lymphatic systems or large-caliber blood vessels may be of significance. BCCs originating in skin overlying the parotid gland have the potential to penetrate to a rich vascular and lymphatic plexus as well as compromise the integrity of the facial nerve. Early treatment of these neoplasms utilizing accurate methods of microscopic control appears warranted to prevent the serious consequences of recurrences and deep tissue involvement. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged",

The two estrogen regimens and dextrothyroxine were discontinued early because of adverse effects. No evidence of efficacy was found for the clofibrate treatment. Niacin treatment showed modest benefit in decreasing definite nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction but did not decrease total mortality. With a mean follow-up of 15 years, nearly 9 years after termination of the trial, mortality from all causes in each of the drug groups, except for niacin, was similar to that in the placebo group. Mortality in the niacin group was 11% lower than in the placebo group (52.0 versus 58.2%; p = 0.0004). This late benefit of niacin, occurring after discontinuation of the drug, may be a result of a translation into a mortality benefit over subsequent years of the early favorable effect of niacin in decreasing nonfatal reinfarction or a result of the cholesterol-lowering effect of niacin, or both. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Biopsy 2)Human 3)Myocarditis",

Patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups depending on the status of the left anterior descending artery and the presence or absence of a left ventricular aneurysm: Group I (n = 25): aneurysm with occluded left anterior descending artery; Group II (n = 27): no aneurysm and occluded left anterior descending artery; Group III (n = 23): no aneurysm and patent left anterior descending artery; and Group IV (n = 4): aneurysm with patent left anterior descending artery. Single vessel disease was more common in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Groups II and III (no aneurysm) (chi 2(4) = 12.8; probability value equal to 0.012). Collateral blood supply in the presence of an occluded left anterior descending artery was significantly less in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Group II (no aneurysm) (0.9 versus 2.4, p less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery disease and collateral blood supply in Groups I and II were directly related (p = 0.012). Neither age, sex nor risk factors for coronary disease correlated with aneurysm formation. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent angina, new myocardial infarction, embolic events or sudden death. More patients in Group II underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in association with inherent poor collateral blood supply is a significant determinant of aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease with either good collateral circulation or a patent left anterior descending artery is uncommonly associated with the development of left ventricular aneurysm. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Diagnosis, Differential 2)Echocardiography 3)Heart Diseases",

Two hundred forty-one patients with dilation of 271 coronary sites were randomized at the time of hospital discharge to receive nifedipine, 10 mg (123 patients), or placebo (118 patients) four times daily for 6 months. No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen. Coronary stenosis recurred in 33% of patients in the placebo group and in 29% of patients in the nifedipine group who complied with the regimen and had angiograms (p = NS). In conclusion, the study did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of nifedipine on the incidence of recurrent stenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Antibiotics 3)Case Report",

Right atrial pressure and other hemodynamic variables including right ventricular stroke work index were also measured before and after the pericardium was widely opened. The pericardium was grossly normal in all patients and only small physiologic effusions were present. In Group I mean pericardial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg as was mean right atrial pressure. In Group II mean pericardial pressure was 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus mean right atrial pressure of 10 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Excluding 2 of the 20 patients with outlying data, pericardial pressure showed linear correlation with right atrial pressure (r = 0.689). In Group I right ventricular stroke work index rose from 5.0 +/- 2.0 to 6.4 +/- 2.1 g-m/m2 (p less than 0.01) after pericardiotomy with no significant increase in mean right atrial pressure; similar findings in Group II were consistent with removal of external constraint. Thus, even in the absence of an abnormal effusion the normal pericardium exerts a significant pressure on the heart, which is often similar in magnitude to right atrial pressure. In certain notable exceptions, however, right atrial pressure far exceeds pericardial pressure. Such pericardial constraint has important implications for ventricular diastolic mechanics. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged",

Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 +/- 36 versus 53 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring in the first half of diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 +/- 14% versus 70 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early diastolic cavity expansion (32 +/- 11%) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0.04 +/- 0.19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0.68 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Angioma, Sclerosing",

The diastolic deceleration slope as measured from the continuous wave tracing was significantly different among subgroups of patients with mild (1.6 +/- 0.5 m/s2), moderate (2.7 +/- 0.5 m/s2) and severe (4.7 +/- 1.5 m/s2) aortic insufficiency as determined from aortography. Deceleration slopes greater than 2 m/s2 separated individuals with moderate and severe insufficiency from those with mild insufficiency. Similar findings were seen when comparing the pressure half-time method of diastolic velocity decay with the more severe grades of aortic insufficiency exhibiting the shortest pressure half-times. There was also a high correlation (r = 0.85) between the deceleration slope measured by continuous wave Doppler recordings and the grade of insufficiency as assessed by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. End-diastolic velocities correlated poorly (r = 0.28) with catheter-measured end-diastolic pressure difference between the aorta and the left ventricle. These findings demonstrate that the aortic regurgitant flow pattern by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography may be useful in quantitating the degree of aortic insufficiency by assessing the rate with which aortic and left ventricular pressures equilibrate during diastole. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenoidectomy 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool",

            "input": "Abstract: Although left ventricular diastolic filling patterns can be examined by both Doppler velocity recordings and gated blood pool scintigraphy, few data exist regarding a comparison of these techniques. Therefore, Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy were compared in 25 patients. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed using an apical four chamber view with the sample volume at the level of the mitral anulus. Doppler measurements included peak velocity of the early diastolic filling wave, time to peak early diastolic velocity from both end-systole and end-diastole, diastolic time period and diastolic integrated velocity (early, atrial and total). The cross-sectional area of the mitral anulus and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume were estimated from measurements made on the apical four chamber view. Scintigraphic measurements included normalized peak filling rate, time to normalized filling rate from both end-diastole and end-systole, diastolic time period and relative diastolic filling during early and atrial filling. Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy compared favorably in assessment of fractional filling during early diastole (r = 0.84) and atrial systole (r = 0.85), ratio of early to atrial filling (r = 0.83), diastolic filling period (r = 0.94) and interval from end-diastole to peak early diastolic flow (r = 0.88). Normalized peak filling rate and time to normalized peak filling rate from end-systole did not correlate closely by these two techniques. The differences in normalized peak filling rate may be explained by difficulties in estimating mitral anulus cross-sectional area and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Ear, Middle 2)Fetal Development 3)Human",

During the 6 to 24 hour period, the control group (n = 20) developed ventricular triplets at rates exceeding 270/min. Seven dogs spontaneously developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (421 +/- 12 beats/min) at 13 +/- 2 hours. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was present for 38 +/- 8 seconds before ventricular fibrillation developed. One dog developed recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, with six episodes lasting from 8 to 72 seconds (375 to 425 beats/min). At 24 hours, ventricular pacing produced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (378 +/- 12 beats/min) in 9 of 13 surviving animals. Nadolol administration 6 hours after coronary artery ligation (n = 19) lowered both the rate (241 +/- 8 versus 328 +/- 8 beats/min; p = 0.001) and the incidence (8 +/- 6 versus 198 +/- 61 per hour; p = 0.004) of rapid ventricular triplets and prevented sudden arrhythmic death (0%; p = 0.005). Nadolol failed to prevent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (88%; 365 +/- 12 beats/min) produced by ventricular pacing. The data suggest that nadolol prevents spontaneous sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by selectively suppressing the arrhythmia trigger (rapid ventricular triplets) without altering the underlying arrhythmia substrate. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Bronchitis 3)Bronchoscopy",

After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10%. An arrhythmia ratio over 10% was observed in 7.7% of the control group and 53% of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, myocardial mitochondria and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined. Significant increases in both mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity were observed in the dogs with hypokalemia and an arrhythmia ratio greater than 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenocarcinoma 2)Aged 3)Case Report",

It is not known whether human plaques take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo. In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing atheromatous plaques were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 degrees C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human atheromatous plaques should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acoustic Impedance Tests 2)Animal 3)Cats",

Single, double and triple truncated exponential shocks separated by 1 ms were delivered through various electrode combinations and cardiac vectors after electrical induction of ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway not incorporating the interventricular septum (catheter electrodes or epicardial patches between anterior and posterior left ventricle) required the highest total energy (22.6 and greater than 26.4 J, respectively) and peak voltage (1,004 and greater than 1,094 V, respectively) to terminate ventricular fibrillation. A single shock through a pathway including the interventricular septum required lower total energy and peak voltage to defibrillate. Combinations of two sequential shocks between an intracardiac catheter electrode and anterior left ventricular epicardial patch, between the catheter electrode and subcutaneous extrathoracic plate and between three ventricular epicardial patches all significantly reduced total energy (7.7, 8.7 and 7.8 J, respectively) and peak voltage (424, 436 and 424 V, respectively) needed to defibrillate. Three sequential shocks exerted no significant additional reduction in total energy of the defibrillation threshold than did two sequential shocks. Infarcted canine heart required less peak voltage but not total energy to terminate ventricular fibrillation than did noninfarcted heart. Therefore, two sequential shocks over different pathways reduce both total energy and peak voltage required to terminate ventricular fibrillation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Aged 3)Female",

Sixty-three infants underwent coarctation repair by resection between 1960 and 1980, and 62 underwent subclavian angioplasty between 1977 and 1985.

To determine an individual's risk of requiring reoperation from these group measures, a reoperation risk model was developed.

In Group I the drainage was infracardiac in nine, supracardiac in seven, intracardiac in eight and mixed in five.

Results were compared with similar data from 30 normal children, 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In patients with partial AV canal, the portion of total cardiac length occupied by the atrial septum did not differ from normal (24.8 +/- 9.9% versus 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p greater than 0.05), but there was a deficiency of both AV and ventricular septal tissue, the latter occupying only 48.2 +/- 7.0% of total cardiac length (versus 57.9 +/- 4.1% in normal subjects, p less than 0.05). Similarly, patients with complete AV canal had a normal amount of atrial septal tissue, a deficiency of AV septal tissue and a deficiency of ventricular septal tissue which was even greater than that of patients with a partial defect (39.4 +/- 5.0% versus 48.2 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.05). Thus, although partial AV canal defect is often called ostium primum atrial septal defect, the amount of atrial tissue is usually normal, the defect being formed by a deficiency of AV and ventricular septal tissue. In the complete form of the lesion, the deficiency of ventricular septal tissue is greater. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Case Report 3)Human",

The diagnosis of specific disease processes has allowed for prenatal intervention by new techniques designed to improve fetal survival. The application of ventricular pacing in a hydropic fetus with complete atrioventricular (AV) block is reported. Complete AV block resulted from maternal collagen vascular disease. The application of ventricular pacing was to allow for further in utero development and for reversal of hydrops fetalis after improvement in cardiac output. Despite fetal death 4 hours after placement of the ventricular pacing lead, this procedure when applied earlier in the development of hydrops may allow for fetal survival. Ventricular pacing was accomplished without apparent trauma to mother or fetus and no evidence of fetal injury was seen at necropsy. Therefore, in the fetus who would otherwise die in utero before the point of viability ex utero, fetal ventricular pacing may be a rational alternative to current observation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cats 3)Laryngeal Nerves",

Systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt) and heart rate were comparable in the three animal groups. In the interval between 3 and 10 to 12 months, mean myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased 53 and 26% in the left and the right ventricle, respectively. The total number of myocyte nuclei remained constant in either ventricle. In the following period, between 10 to 12 and 19 to 21 months, a 39% further cellular hypertrophy on the left side of the heart was found in association with an 18% loss of cells in the ventricle. Cell loss was accompanied by discrete areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the subendocardium. In contrast, no myocardial damage was observed in the right ventricle, and the measured 35% additional enlargement of myocytes occurred without a change in cell number. Thus, the aging left ventricle is composed of a smaller number of hypertrophied cells. Cellular hypertrophy may explain the unaltered cardiac function of the aged myocardium. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Collagen 2)Epistaxis 3)Gelatin Sponge, Absorbable",

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W). The reduction in PaO2 was not due to alveolar hypoventilation, because nifedipine did not alter arterial carbon dioxide tension, or to changes in mixed venous oxygen tension, which nifedipine increased at rest (39 +/- 2 versus 43 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and during submaximal exercise (31 +/- 4 versus 33 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.03) and maximal exercise (27 +/- 3 versus 31 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Artificial Intelligence 2)Cerebral Ischemia, Transient 3)Decision Making, Computer-Assisted",

To investigate the effect of two treatment regimens, subjects were paired according to their skin sensitivity to ragweed extract and the severity of their rhinoconjunctivitis the previous year. One of each pair was randomly allocated to receive injections at weekly intervals, and the other subject was to receive injections daily until a local or systemic adverse reaction occurred and then to switch to a weekly schedule for the rest of the course. Blood was obtained immediately before each injection and at the end of the study to examine the rates of change of ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibody levels and to evaluate whether these or other variables could be used to predict the occurrence of adverse reactions. Immediate reactions were minimal in both groups, but more late reactions occurred in subjects receiving the modified rush regimen; therefore, although the total number of injections received by the two groups was similar, the total dose of protein injected in the rush group was only half that achieved in the weekly group. Treatment induced increases in ragweed-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in both groups; the increase in IgE was similar in the two groups, but the increase in IgG was higher in the weekly group. There was a marked decrease in skin sensitivity to ragweed extract after treatment that was directly related to the IgG antibody response, and therefore, these changes were greater in the weekly group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Biomechanics 2)Human 3)Models, Biological",

Ten adult volunteers were tested on two separate occasions. Their noses were pretreated by oral administration of either combined H1 and H2 histamine antagonists or H1 antagonist and placebo. The nasal airflow resistive response to topical histamine was then determined. Combined histamine antagonism was significantly more effective in reducing the nasal resistive response to topical histamine than H1 antagonist alone (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, ingestion of the oral H1 histamine antagonist, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, alone led to an increase in resistance of the unprovoked nose, whereas combined H1 and H2 antagonism did not lead to a significant change. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Ankle Joint 3)Athletic Injuries",

Efficacy was evaluated by symptom scores, concomitant antihistamine use, and suppression of histamine- and codeine-induced wheal response. Doxepin-treated subjects experienced fewer lesions (p less than 0.001), less waking hours with lesions (p less than 0.01), lesser degree of itch and/or discomfort (p less than 0.001), and less swelling or angioedema (p less than 0.001) as compared to placebo-treated subjects. Doxepin-treated subjects required less daily concomitant antihistamine use (mean 0.13 tablets versus 1.48 tablets, p less than 0.05). Doxepin also significantly suppressed histamine- and codeine-induced cutaneous wheal response as compared to placebo. Lethargy was commonly observed but diminished with continued use. Dry mouth and constipation were also commonly observed. We conclude that doxepin is an effective agent for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Anthropometry 2)Body Composition 3)Child",

However, an earlier investigation found that lymphocytes from patients with CSD and control subjects were equally unresponsive in vitro to cat-scratch antigen. In contrast, we found that 16 patients with CSD had significantly increased lymphocyte transformation responses to cat-scratch antigen when patients were compared to control subjects. This cell-mediated immune response may be directed against nonviable bacteria in the involved lymph nodes and may be the major mechanism responsible for the granulomatous reaction and clinical features of CSD. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Age Factors",

            "input": "Abstract: The effects of parental smoking on IgE and IgD levels in cord serum and subsequent infant allergy were investigated in an unselected series of 186 European newborn infants. Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \"low-risk\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Age Factors 2)Alcohol Drinking 3)Body Height",

            "input": "Abstract: We have induced a basophil hypersensitivity reaction in the upper tarsal conjunctiva of the guinea pig by methods that induce a comparable basophil hypersensitivity reaction in the flank. The inflammatory cell infiltrate in this reaction contained large numbers of basophils and eosinophils with accompanying neutrophils and monocytes. Ocular tissue can serve as a priming site for systemic immunization and also for elicitation of a secondary flare after challenge with antigen. Very few inflammatory cells were observed in the cutaneous epithelium of either primary or secondary flares. In contrast, the mucosal stroma and epithelium contained large numbers of inflammatory cells (basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils), suggesting directed cellular movement onto the ocular surface. The lesion of ocular basophil hypersensitivity in the guinea pig has features in common with two human eye diseases, vernal conjunctivitis and contact lens-associated giant papillary conjunctivitis. We hypothesize that the acute basophil hypersensitivity reactions of the conjunctiva are transformed into chronic inflammatory and proliferative states in vernal conjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Anabolic Steroids 2)Animal 3)Cholesterol",

            "input": "Abstract: It is evident that asthma and the other allergic diseases constitute a health problem of international scope. There is a need for well-designed, large-scale, prospective epidemiologic studies designed to define precisely the magnitude of the worldwide problem created by allergic disorders. Most studies to date have been small and have involved special groups rather than the entire population. With the exception of data reported from developing countries, prevalence rates for childhood asthma are noted to be both increasing and higher than adult rates. While exact reasons are not known, the state of development of immune system regulation and hyperreactivity to allergens encountered in early life may play a role. Whether the actual prevalence and incidence of allergic diseases in children are increasing or whether this observation represents a phenomenon resulting from improved diagnostic methods and recognition of these disorders needs to be established. Paradoxically, despite advances in treatment, the severity of asthma and allergic diseases appears to be increasing. Accordingly, it is especially important to search for the factors that lead to the expression of immune and hypersensitivity mechanisms. Differences in rural and urban populations appear to be real and suggest the need to examine the factors of indoor and outdoor environments created by air pollution, crowding, and allergen exposure and the demands made on the immune system by frequency of challenge by respiratory tract infections. Still among the unknowns is the effect on the natural history of allergic disease after changes in urban-rural residences in countries in which helminth infections are not hyper IgE-stimulating factors. The creation of new occupationally related allergens at worksites and the contribution of industrialization to the deterioration of the natural environment needs to be adequately assessed. Whether breast feeding may have an effect on either the prevention or delayed emergence of food allergies in children requires documentation by long-term prospective studies based on objective testing. A possible relationship between respiratory tract infection and the development of asthma is exemplified by clinical observations. The emergence of asthma in infants increases with successive episodes of bronchiolitis; triggering of asthmatic attacks by acute respiratory tract viral infections is a common occurrence, especially during childhood years; and chronic adult onset asthma is often preceded or accompanied by chronic sinusitis or complicated by lower respiratory tract infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged",

Dust exposure was estimated by personal and area sampling for total dust during a work shift and cumulative exposure by duration of employment. Seven percent of the workers had an elevated RAST, and 20% had nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Elevation in RAST was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Almost half (46%) of the workers with RAST elevation had bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to 18% in workers with no RAST elevation. The association was unaffected by total IgE level or by limiting the analysis to workers without respiratory symptoms and was most apparent in younger workers. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as with lower levels of pulmonary function. The likelihood of bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased with increasing age but was unrelated to the dust-exposure concentration. RAST elevation was unrelated to employment duration or dust exposure and was not associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms or lower levels of pulmonary function independent of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that plicatic acid-specific IgE and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness are associated in western red-cedar workers and that this association may reflect a causal connection. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Electrophoresis 2)Electrophoresis, Starch Gel 3)Human",

The occurrence of both phenomena in the same patient made it possible to study cross-reactivity patterns of potato antigens. An 11-year-old girl, exclusively breast-fed for her first 4 months, developed anaphylactic symptoms after ingestion of potato at 5 months of age when she was fed potato for the first time. Subsequently, she developed urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory and systemic symptoms on contact with potatoes, ingestion of potatoes, and exposure to cooking potatoes or potato pollen. Three allergenic extracts from potato pulp, peel, and pollen were prepared. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectrofocusing of the three extracts were performed. IgE-mediated allergy to these extracts was demonstrated by means of immediate skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer, RAST, RAST inhibition, and leukocyte histamine release. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pulp extract followed by electroblotting and autoradiography demonstrated specific IgE antibodies directed against several proteins ranging from 14,000 to 40,000 daltons. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Eosinophilia 3)Human",

Rocket immunoelectrophoresis for C4d is a sensitive assay for C4 activation in plasma. We have evaluated the value of this assay in identifying patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. C4 activation was assessed in the plasmas of 15 patients with hereditary angioedema, five patients with variant form of hereditary angioedema, and four patients with acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. Control groups consisted of 27 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and/or angioedema and seven normal volunteers. C4 activation was detected in all 52 plasma samples collected from the 24 patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. The degree of C4 activation increased during attacks of angioedema and decreased (but remained elevated) during treatment with attenuated androgens. The concentrations of C4, C2, and C1 inhibitor were also measured; however, none of these measurements identified all of the patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency. Thus, we conclude that the measurement of C4 activation is one of the best tests available to evaluate a patient for C1-inhibitor deficiency, and a normal result will exclude the diagnosis of C1-inhibitor deficiency. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Action Potentials 2)Electric Stimulation 3)Electromyography",

Small amounts of histamine were spontaneously and continuously released during the 4-hour observation in both groups but were twofold greater in patients with CU. In addition, histamine levels were significantly more elevated in sites challenged with compound 48/80 than in unstimulated sites. Patients with CU differed from normal volunteers in that histamine release induced by 48/80 compound was significantly greater at 1 and 2 hours after challenge. The number of mast cells and the histamine content of the skin did not differ in the two groups. These observations could suggest a functional defect at the mast cell level rather than a difference in their numbers. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Atrophy 3)Fetus",

In order to reveal some of the possible agents involved in this reaction, 18 patients with a history of red wine-induced asthma were studied. They received, in a double-blind fashion, red wine with low sulfur dioxide (SO2) and high amine, high SO2 and high amine and low SO2 and low amine content. In each challenge, the wine was administered in stepwise increasing quantities until a total of 385 ml or a fall in peak expiratory flow of greater than 15% was reached. Nine subjects demonstrated a significant fall in peak flow in one or more challenges. In all cases the most severe reaction was observed after the wine with high SO2 content. The study suggests that SO2 is the most important factor in red wine-induced asthma. It is recommended that wine labels provide information on the SO2 content. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Autoantibodies 2)Comparative Study 3)Edrophonium",

The absorption of injected epinephrine was variable and in several cases very slow. The individual maximum values for epinephrine in plasma were 4.65 +/- 1.09 (range 0.74 to 8.31) nmol/L, and these maxima were attained 5 to 120 minutes after injection. Inhaled epinephrine was rapidly and dose dependently absorbed. Ten inhalations resulted in 2.72 +/- 0.84 (0.75 to 5.67) nmol/L within 5 minutes and 20 inhalations resulted in 7.19 +/- 1.78 (2.10 to 13.83) nmol/L with rapid increases and maxima within 20 minutes in seven of eight subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting when epinephrine was administered by inhalation. Our results indicate that inhalation of 2 to 3 mg of epinephrine produces rapid increases of epinephrine concentrations in plasma to levels that have previously been demonstrated to counteract bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in subjects with asthma. Inhalation has several advantages over injection for self-administration of epinephrine, e.g., in patients who are allergic to insect (Hymenoptera) stings. Apart from the absorption being more rapid, the locally high concentrations of epinephrine in the airways should be advantageous, since bronchoconstriction is one of the life-threatening phenomena of the anaphylactic reaction. This route of administration is also simple for the patient. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Diagnosis, Differential 3)Electromyography",

This study quantitated the influence of weight gain on birth weight and identified rates and total amounts of weight gain related to the birth of healthy-sized infants to healthy low-income women who entered pregnancy underweight, at normal weight, overweight, or obese. Data used in the study were obtained from randomly sampled prenatal health records from Maternal and Infant Care (MIC) projects in Cleveland and Minneapolis. Subsamples of healthy mothers who delivered healthy-sized infants were identified from each sample, and rates and total amounts of weight gain by prepregnancy weight status group were calculated. There were 384 healthy mother and healthy-sized infant pairs in the Cleveland subsample and 75 such pairs in the Minneapolis sample. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of prenatal weight gain and birth weight varied depending on prepregnancy weight status. Prenatal weight gains related to the birth of healthy-sized infants (newborns with birth weights of 3,000 to 4,500 gm) to healthy mothers in the Cleveland MIC sample averaged 33 lb for underweight, 32 lb for normal weight, 29 lb for overweight, and 19 lb for obese women. Except for obese women, rates and total amount of weight gain associated with the birth of healthy-sized infants were equivalent for the two samples. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Capital Expenditures 2)Efficiency 3)Risk",

After families had received their public assistance and Food Stamp allotments for the month, a 24-hour recall was obtained each week from each family member so that food intake could be monitored from the recalls as food-buying resources were depleted. Although families bought most of their food the first 2 weeks, they maintained a relatively constant food intake through the last week of the month. However, when nutrient intakes were compared with Recommended Dietary Allowances, the diets were found to be well supplied in protein, ascorbic acid, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, and phosphorus, and inadequately supplied in vitamin B-6, vitamin D, vitamin E, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and pantothenic acid. Since that finding was true not just at the end of the month but from the beginning, it indicated that the nutrition problems of low-income families are not intermittent, but continuous. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Firearms 2)Human 3)United States",

The majority had had recent blood pressure checks, seldom missed work because of infections, made time for leisure activities, and felt secure in their jobs. Overall, the percentage of smokers was slightly below the national average, but 45% of the technical employees smoked. Perception of overweight and skipped meals increased with level of education. Consumption of fried foods and sweets decreased with the level of education while fiber intake increased. More skilled and technical employees than professional employees consumed milk products. Less than half of any employee group consumed excessive amounts of coffee or colas. Few study participants consumed alcohol. Very few members of any group consumed meals away from home five or more times per week. Less than half of all employees believed that they received enough exercise; one-third or less exercised regularly. A greater percentage of technical employees than of the other two employee groups expressed interest in improving health through physical fitness and class sessions. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Arrhythmia 3)Case Report",

Sixteen entrees were investigated: seven single-item, six combination, and three roast. Data collection took place in a period of 5 days over a 2-week span. A total of 3,891 observations was recorded during 297 labor hours. Results of the study indicated 59.2% of the total labor time was spent in direct work, 23.3% in indirect work, and 17.5% in delays. The preparation work function represented the highest proportion of labor time for both single-item and roast entrees, but prepreparation consumed the greatest amount of time for combination entrees. Mean labor minutes per serving for the 16 entrees were 0.9, with a range of 0.4 to 3.5. Mean labor minutes per serving for combination entrees were 1.4, which was the highest among the three groups; range was from 0.4 to 3.5 minutes per serving. For single item entrees, mean minutes per serving were 0.6, with a range of 0.4 to 0.8. Roast entrees, had a mean time requirement per serving of 0.5 minute, with a range of 0.4 to 0.6. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Comparative Study 2)Female 3)Graves' Disease",

The panel of experts concluded that height and weight tables based on mortality data and the body mass index (BMI) are helpful measures to determine the presence of obesity and the need for treatment. For the dietitian, however, practical concerns arise regarding which index to select. The usefulness of the BMI in patient education and contradictions between the 1959 and 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance height-weight tables are discussed. A temporary solution is offered in light of the need for further investigation into morbidity experience at weights recommended in the 1983 table. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Female 2)Human 3)Hypothyroidism",

Cultural foods education needs must be identified and evaluated so that they can be appropriately addressed in the nutrition and dietetics curriculums. Dietitians employed in California hospitals were surveyed to assess their cultural foods knowledge and determine cultural foods education needs. Demographic and opinion data were requested, and knowledge of the food habits of the six largest ethnic groups in the state was tested. California colleges and universities offering ADA Plan IV programs were sent questionnaires regarding the goals, content, and methodology of and the enrollment in cultural foods courses. Results of the dietitian survey (no. = 184; response rate 51%) showed a positive association (p less than .05) between the total score on the cultural foods knowledge test (average score = 62% correct) and completion of a college cultural foods course. Results of the Plan IV program survey (no. = 16; response rate 93%) indicate that 86% of the colleges and universities offer at least one cultural foods course. In 53% of those colleges and universities, Plan IV students are required to take such a course. Course content corresponds well to needs identified in the answers to the dietitian questionnaire. More emphasis on \"ethnic food habits\" and \"disease and food habits\" is recommended in the nutrition and dietetics curriculums. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenocarcinoma 2)Adult 3)Case Report",

In the authors' sample of 131 DAT subjects, 41 (31%) also met DMS-III criteria for a major affective disorder. Of those DAT plus depression patients whose records reflected treatment (usually with a tricyclic antidepressant), 85% (17 of 20) showed clear evidence of improvement in mood, vegetative signs, or activities of daily living (ADLs) based on review of the medical record. An analysis of change in cognitive function (measured by the Folstein Mini-Mental State) and five global measures failed to reveal any differences between the depressed and nondepressed groups after a mean interval of 17 months. The depression that occurs in approximately one-quarter to one-third of DAT patients appears to respond to appropriate therapy. These patients often show improvement in their mood and ADLs but remain demented. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Human 2)Leukoplakia, Oral",

Using chart review and interviews with the residents, it was found that multiple physical factors, including pain, strength, endurance, vision and balance, and multiple social and environmental factors, including the fear of falling, were related to the resident's decision to use a wheelchair as an alternative means of mobility. A physical examination focused on aspects of mobility was completed on each resident and was intended to characterize the physical limitations in groups studied. In the nursing home environment, use of the wheelchair is viewed by the residents as a self-initiated choice which the residents believed significantly enhanced their sense of well-being. Finally, there was minimal recognition of mobility as a problem on the part of the medical and nursing staff. The study raises a number of important issues concerning walking versus wheelchair use in the nursing home. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Appendectomy 2)Appendicitis 3)Female",

Overall autopsy rate was 36%. Autopsy rates declined sharply with age from 60% for those aged 16 to 34 years to 23% for those 85 and over (P less than .001). The highest rates by diagnosis were aortic aneurysm (70%), hepatic failure (52%), heart rhythm disturbance (48%), pulmonary embolism (45%), and sepsis (41%). Patients receiving major procedures had a significantly higher autopsy rate (38 versus 29%, P less than .05) but rates bore little relation to prognoses given at admission by house officers, suddenness of death, sex, marital status or year of admission. Even among intensively treated patients, autopsy rates decline strikingly with age, demanding honest re-appraisal to restore the place of autopsy in medical education, clinical research, and quality of care assessment for an increasingly elderly population. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Brain 3)Brain Diseases",

The parameters reviewed included age, home situation, diagnosis, incidence of co-existent medical disorders, management by the social worker, nurses and neuropsychiatrist, the extent of social and program participation, length of stay, and disposition. There was a high incidence of medical problems which were managed effectively because of close nursing observation, availability of ancillary services, specialty clinics, and frequent communication with the community physicians. The social worker assisted families with the management of long-term planning for the dementia patients and the entire social-nursing-recreational therapy team devised programs which encouraged the patients to function at an optimum level. Neuropsychiatric management, including drug therapy, was an integral part of the program. Despite the fact that the dementia patients were at high risk, with an average age of 81 years the average duration of attendance was two years four months and only nine of the 34 patients ultimately required nursing home placement. It was concluded that the day care program served as a resource which devised, integrated, and supervised, in cooperation with the community physicians, the support network and management strategies for the dementia patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Administration, Cutaneous 2)Estradiol 3)Female",

            "input": "Abstract: In search of a practical biochemical test that will reflect hepatic steatosis, we assessed the significance of serum cholinesterase activity in 48 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver, 16 obese subjects without fatty liver, 30 cases of chronic persistent hepatitis, 38 cases of chronic active hepatitis, and 20 cases of liver cirrhosis. Increased cholinesterase activity was observed in nonobese as well as obese patients with fatty liver, whereas obese subjects without fatty liver showed levels in the upper normal range. When we set a cutoff level above the upper normal limit, half of the patients with fatty liver showed values above it, with only a few overlaps with other patients. When obese patients with fatty liver took a low-caloric diet, cholinesterase activity decreased, clearly reflecting improvement of hepatic steatosis. Thus, measurement of cholinesterase activity is of diagnostic value and an alternative to computed tomography in hepatic steatosis, and will provide a practical measure for the assessment of effects during follow-up. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Abdomen 2)Adult 3)Coccidia",

            "input": "Abstract: The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) in humans has a number of similarities to the immunodeficiencies found in CBA/N mice, including X-chromosome-linked inheritance, inability to produce antibodies to various carbohydrate antigens, susceptibility to various bacterial infections, and an imbalance in B lymphocyte subpopulations. Moreover, in both man and mice, IgG antibodies to polysaccharides are predominantly, but not exclusively, restricted to a single IgG subclass--IgG2 in man, and IgG3 in the mouse. Because CBA/N mice have a deficiency of IgG3 antibodies and because human IgG2 subclass deficiencies have been generally associated with inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, it would seem likely that patients with WAS would have greatly reduced levels of IgG2. Quite to the contrary, the data presented here demonstrate that WAS patients have normal levels of the different IgG subclasses, including IgG2. Thus, inability to produce antibodies to carbohydrates is not always associated with IgG2 subclass deficiency. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Child Abuse 2)Human 3)Infant",

This study describes the potent in vivo effect of pertussigen on the levels of antigen-specific macrophage-activating lymphokine(s); lymphokine(s) was measured by the stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity (mPCA), or plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Lymphoid cells were removed from immunized animals and cultured with specific antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, ovalbumin, or human gamma-globulin. The culture supernatants were then incubated with the monocyte-like cell line WEHI-265 to measure mPCA or with WEHI-265 or resident peritoneal macrophages to measure PA activity. Mice were given pertussigen at the time of immunization, and the subsequent generation by lymphocyte supernatants of both of these macrophage activities proved to be greatly enhanced; the effect of pertussigen was antigen specific. Pertussigen thus induces an increase in lymphokine(s) production responsible for the in vitro increase in macrophage mPCA and PA activity and which may be responsible for some of the potent immune effects of this agent in vivo. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acute Disease 2)Anemia 3)Blood Substitutes",

            "input": "Abstract: Human IgG4 antibodies directed against phospholipase A, the P1 antigen from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extracts, and cat albumin were found unable to cross-link antigen. Previously, it was demonstrated that IgG4 antibodies, in contrast to IgG1 antibodies, did not cross-link Sepharose-bound antigen and antigen added in solution. To eliminate the possibility that this phenomenon was caused by preferential binding of both IgG4 Fab fragments to the solid-phase-bound antigen, cross-linking of antigen was studied in a fluid-phase system. In this test, incapability of IgG4 antibodies to bridge two antigens was also found. As a result of such a phenomenon, it is expected that immune complexes formed by IgG4 antibodies will be considerably smaller than complexes formed by IgG1. This was confirmed by analysis of the molecular size profiles of IgG1- and IgG4-containing immune complexes in sucrose-density gradients. Moreover, IgG1 was able to precipitate antigen in a radioimmunoprecipitation test, whereas precipitation was not demonstrable by the same amount of IgG4 antibodies. Even 3% polyethylene glycol 8,000 did not precipitate the small IgG4-containing immune complexes efficiently. The antibodies studied were of a high-affinity type, and there was no significant difference in association constants between IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies. Therefore, we were not able to confirm observations reported in the literature that the IgG4 subclass is associated with a low-affinity antibody response; probably, the affinity of the IgG4 antibodies was underestimated by other investigators because of the polyethylene glycol precipitation technique used to separate antibody-bound and free antigen. Our findings stress the point that IgG4 antibodies take a special place in the immune response upon chronic exposure to antigen. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Analysis of Variance 3)Body Constitution",

Two parasite molecules have been implicated in the attachment event: Leishmania lipopolysaccharide (L-LPS) and a glycoprotein (gp63). This study was designed to clarify the role of L-LPS in infection and the stage in the process of infection at which it operates. We have recently identified a Leishmania major strain (LRC-L119) which lacks the L-LPS molecule and is not infective for hamsters or mice. This parasite was isolated from a gerbil in Kenya and was identified phenotypically as L. major by isoenzyme and fatty acid analysis. In this study we have confirmed at the genotype level that LRC-L119 is L. major by analyzing and comparing the organization of cloned DNA sequences in the genome of different strains of L. major. Here we show that LRC-L119 promastigotes are phagocytosed rapidly by macrophages in vitro, but in contrast to virulent strains of L. major, they are then killed over a period of 18 hr. In addition, we show that transfer of purified L-LPS from a virulent clone of L. major (V121) into LRC-L119 promastigotes confers on them the ability to survive in macrophages in vitro. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Age Factors 2)Body Temperature Regulation 3)Case Report",

We reasoned that cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL. Preliminary clinical trials indicate a beneficial therapeutic effect associated with increased T suppressor cells in lesions. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aged 2)Atrial Fibrillation 3)Case Report",

Both of these factors are antigen-specific and I-J+. GAT-TsF1 is not MHC-restricted and is composed of a single polypeptide chain, whereas GAT-TsF2 is MHC-restricted and is composed of two different polypeptide chains. We have not previously found evidence for an obligatory, idiotype-specific suppressor T cell in this suppressor pathway. However, we now report that idiotype-specific suppressor T cells can be elicited by exposing normal spleen cells to GAT-TsF1 or GAT-TsF2 in the absence of antigen in vitro. These factor (TsF1/TsF2)-induced cells have been fused with the AKR thymoma, BW5147, and hybridomas were selected for production of suppressor factors that inhibit GAT-specific antibody responses in vitro. In this report, we characterize one monoclonal factor from each fusion. Neither factor binds GAT or the related co-polymer, GT; both factors have binding sites for GAT-specific idiotypes but not for unrelated idiotypes either in the form of antibody immobilized on Sepharose or as cell surface determinants expressed by B cell hybridomas. Moreover, their reactivities for a panel of monoclonal anti-GAT antibodies are overlapping but not identical. Both factors are composed of two polypeptide chains, and both chains are required for suppressive activity; one chain bears the I-J determinant, whereas the other possesses the idiotype-binding activity of the intact molecule. Both idiotype-binding factors are restricted by MHC- and Igh-linked genes, and transcomplementation is observed in the F1 mice between MHC-congenic and Igh-congenic parents. Both factors are active late in Mishell-Dutton cultures. These data support the contention that these two factors are similar but nonidentical members of an anti-idiotypic class of GAT-specific suppressor factors. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Income 2)Malpractice 3)Motivation",

These results are compared with similar observations in college students with an acute, febrile, noninfluenzal respiratory illness that occurred during the same outbreak. The lymphopenia typical of influenza during acute illness was shown to be due to a reduction in both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. In addition, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A responses were reduced and NKC activity was increased, while pokeweed mitogen reactivity was unaltered at the time of admission to the study. Patients with noninfluenzal illness showed early polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a similar lymphopenia. Lymphocyte functions were virtually unchanged during acute illness in noninfluenza patients. The relatively specific alterations in lymphocyte responses to lectin-induced stimulation in influenza patients may indicate that the peripheral T cells are incapable of activation via the CD3 or CD2 activation pathways. In addition, increased NKC activity in the periphery may be reflective of increased NKC activity in the lung. Influenza-infected individuals with higher NKC activity at the time of admission to the study also took longer to recover. Finally, the early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza-infected patient may represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected respiratory tract as a consequence of infection. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Astrocytes 2)Brain 3)Case Report",

Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Ethics, Medical 2)Financing, Personal 3)Hospitals, Proprietary",

Of the nine anti-DNA and anti-Sm monoclonals tested, six showed significant binding to affinity-purified rabbit IgG (RIgG) and human IgG (HIgG). To confirm that cross-reactivities were due to a single antibody, immunoabsorption of a representative polyspecific monoclonal termed C11 (anti-DNA, anti-Sm) on either Sepharose-DNA or Sepharose-RIgG resulted in marked loss of activity to the three antigens DNA, Sm and RIgG compared with immunoabsorption on Sepharose-bovine serum albumin. The monomolecular nature of the cross-reacting antibody was also suggested by inhibition analysis of C11; DNA inhibited C11 binding to RIgG 64%, whereas Sm inhibited binding to RIgG 33%. Aggregated RIgG and HIgG, however, did not inhibit binding of C11 to DNA, Sm, or solid-phase RIgG, probably reflecting the low affinity of this antibody for fluid phase Ig. Together, these findings suggest that antinuclear autoantibodies of the IgG, as well as the IgM, class have polyspecific IgG binding activity and suggest that IgG antinuclear antibodies may emerge from rheumatoid factor responses. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Hepatitis B 3)Hepatitis B Antibodies",

Adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found to contain bombesin.

Both probes revealed complex and polymorphic arrays of DNA fragments in Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA. Following the distribution of these bands in panels of somatic cell hybrids carrying various combinations of mouse chromosomes on a constant rat or Chinese hamster background allowed the localization of the C5-associated fragments to proximal chromosome 2 and the localization of the factor H-associated fragments to chromosome 1 or chromosome 3. Following the inheritance of DNA restriction fragment-length polymorphisms revealed by the probes in recombinant inbred mouse strains allowed the factor H-associated fragments to be mapped to Sas-1 on chromosome 1, and the C5-associated fragments to be mapped to Hc. Analysis of three-point crosses, in turn, placed the latter locus 19 cM distal to Sd on chromosome 2. We have designated the two loci Cfh and C5, respectively. This genetic analysis raises the possibility that C5 and factor H are both encoded by complex loci composed of distinct structural and regulatory genes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Coronary Disease 2)Coronary Thrombosis 3)Human",

CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils, specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents, Home 2)Aged 3)Burns",

These recombinants included three recently developed strains, B10.ASR1, B10.ASR11, and B10.ASR12; and two strains B10.S(9R) and B10.HTT derived earlier. Although these recombinants were reciprocal in haplotype orientation to the three recombinants we reported recently, these too crossed over within the same 7 kb stretch of DNA in the E beta gene. This 7 kb stretch of DNA included the 3' half of the first intron, the beta 1 exon, the second intron, and the beta 2 exon. A comparison of the cDNA sequences of the two parental E beta alleles revealed that although the beta 2 exons were identical, there were several nucleotide differences between the two beta 1 exons. This allowed us to determine the parental origin of the beta 1 exon in the recombinants at the level of transcription by using S1 nuclease mapping. Thus we were able to show that in each case the 3' portion of the first intron and the beta 1 exon were upstream from the site of crossover. All eight recombinants involving the k and s haplotypes now can be mapped within a 4.5 kb stretch of DNA, which includes only the beta 1-beta 2 intron and the beta 2 exon of the E beta gene. These findings imply that the I-E molecules expressed in these recombinants will probably have conserved sequences and therefore will exhibit identical I-E-restricted immune responses, despite the fact that crossing over could have occurred at different sites within the beta 1-beta 2 intron. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Child 2)Child, Preschool 3)Human",

            "input": "Abstract: The objective of this study was to elucidate the cellular mechanism of IgE nonresponse to the Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar) pollen antigen (CPAg), which was shown in our previous study to be HLA-linked (1). We established an assay system for the measurement of small amounts of anti-CPAg IgE antibody, both in an antigen-specific and isotype-specific manner, and a culture system to induce antigen-driven IgE antibody synthesis in vitro. By using these methods, we clarified that the function of the HLA-DR molecule in the CPAg-driven IgE response is similar to that of I-A or I-E molecule in mice, namely the product of immune response genes (Ir-genes), because anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody blocked the response, and the interaction between monocyte and monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to respond to CPAg was restricted by HLA-DR. Furthermore, PBL from nonresponders revealed a specific IgE response to CPAg when the Leu-2+3- T cell fraction was depleted, thereby suggesting that even nonresponders have Leu-2-3+ T cell and B cell clones specific for CPAg, and they apparently show no response due to the presence of CPAg-specific Leu-2+3- suppressor T cells. This suppressor T cell fraction abolished the IgE response of the autologous B + monocyte + Leu-2-3+ T cell in a CPAg-specific manner. The current cellular analysis together with our previous genetic analysis strongly suggest that the HLA-linked IgE nonresponse to CPAg is mediated by CPAg-specific suppressor T cells. The HLA-linked gene controlling the nonresponsiveness to CPAg is thus designated as the immune suppression gene for CPAg (Is-CPAg). Mapping of Is-CPAg within HLA-DQ subregion is discussed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Calcium Carbonate 2)Hemodialysis 3)Human",

Multiple animal models demonstrate increased rates of tumor dissemination after surgical stress; previously, we have observed that surgical stress impairs murine NKCC. Because of the importance of surgery in the control of solid tumors, it appeared valuable to examine the mechanism underlying surgical stress impairment of NKCC. The results of this study demonstrate that postsurgical suppression of NKCC begins as early as 2 hr after murine hind limb amputation, reaches nadir at 4 days, and does not recover to control level until postoperative day 12. Anesthetic treatment alone does not cause comparable NKCC suppression. The suppression of NKCC accompanied changes in both splenic size and morphology. The immune suppression was observed in multiple compartments including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Mixing experiments demonstrated that surgical stress per se generated a suppressor cell population affecting NKCC. The observed suppression apparently required cell-to-cell contact, because supernatants from 4 and 18 hr cultures of suppressor cells did not cause suppression. The observed suppression was prevented by perioperative treatment with the pyrimidinone analog 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4-pyrimidinol. These preclinical observations point to the future prospect of NK-specific perioperative immunotherapy that may help prevent possible tumor dissemination from occurring at the time of surgery. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Autoantibodies 2)Human 3)Psoriasis",

            "input": "Abstract: The ability of several surface-active agents to stimulate the humoral immune response in mice against haptenated liposomes was tested. The surfactants were block copolymers of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene (POE) and hydrophobic polyoxypropylene (POP) that differed in m.w., percentage of POE, and mode of linkage of POP to POE. The liposomes were haptenated with tripeptide-enlarged dinitrophenyl coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine, which was incorporated into the liposomal membrane. Additional injection of mice with surfactant stimulated serum hemagglutination titers and splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers to varying extents. Block polymers with POP chains flanking a POE center, as well as polymers with POE chains flanking a POP center, displayed high adjuvant activity. These block polymers stimulated the antibody response in a dose-dependent manner. They stimulated the antibody response with both high and low antigen doses. Furthermore, the addition of one of these adjuvants (25R1) reduced the amount of carrier lipid required in the liposome in order to obtain an optimal antibody response. The surfactants, which displayed high adjuvant activity, did not interfere with liposome stability as measured with a liposome lysis assay. Moreover, in vitro preincubation of liposomes with a block polymer did not affect their immunogenicity. Optimal adjuvant activity was observed when both adjuvant and liposomes were administered by the same route. Simultaneous injection of both components, however, is not a prerequisite. Conclusively, it can be stated that nonionic block polymer surfactants are potent adjuvants for stimulation of the antibody response against haptenated liposomes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Case Report 3)Glomerulonephritis",

We have found that human neutrophils resist complement lysis by the physical removal of membrane attack complexes by both endocytic and exocytic process. The latter mechanism predominates, vesiculation being detectable within 60 sec of initiating the complement cascade. Sixty-five percent of the formed complexes are removed on plasma membrane vesicles, although only 2% of the cell surface is lost. Ultrastructural examination revealed that these vesicles were covered with ring-like \"classical\" complement lesions. Analysis of these vesicles by gel electrophoresis indicated that C9 was present exclusively in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant, high m.w. complex. In contrast, the 35% of C9 that remained associated with the cells was found to be inaccessible to a C9-specific monoclonal antibody, and was partly degraded, suggesting internalization of the membrane attack complex and proteolysis of some C9 molecules. The molar ratio of C9 to C8 was 12 to 1 on shed vesicles and on recovered cells. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Helper Cells 2)Human 3)Suppressor Cells",

LXA and three of its isomers were prepared by total organic synthesis and assayed for activity with human NK cells. Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. 6S-LXA, with its 6S-OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, 6S-11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and 6S-LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither 6S-11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting \"signals\" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi. Thus, this latter event may appear to be important in cytotoxicity. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Antibodies, Monoclonal",

            "input": "Abstract: Sequential development of Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes from a noninfective to an infective stage was demonstrated. The generation of infective forms was related to their growth cycle and restricted to stationary stage organisms. Using immunofluorescence techniques, we have noticed that the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against L. braziliensis (VD5/25) increased progressively as the promastigotes developed in culture and was maximal with the infective forms. This antigenic differentiation was not detected with an anti-L. braziliensis polyclonal rabbit antiserum, suggesting that only a few epitopes, including that recognized by VD5/25, have their expression effectively increased on the surface of infective promastigotes. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of surface-iodinated L. braziliensis promastigotes with this mAb revealed two proteins of apparent 65,000 and 50,000 Mr, the 50,000 Mr protein probably representing the unreduced form of the major surface glycoprotein described in several species of Leishmania (GP65). The increasing expression of this epitope was not found with L. chagasi promastigotes, but seems to occur with the parasites from the L. mexicana complex. Intracellular survival of L. braziliensis was completely inhibited when the infective promastigotes were treated with VD5/25. It appears, therefore, that the increasing expression of GP65 on the promastigote surface represents an essential mechanism of leishmania survival in the macrophage. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Brain Injuries 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool",

            "input": "Abstract: Early cellular events in the malignant transformation of melanocytes to melanoma are virtually unknown. In vitro investigation of this phenomenon has been hampered by the fastidious nature of the human epidermal melanocyte, which has proven difficult to cultivate. The present study compares responsiveness of cultured human epidermal melanocytes and established melanoma cell lines to serum, cholera toxin, and melanocyte growth factor (MGF), three established melanocyte mitogens. Four of four established human melanoma lines were substantially stimulated by fetal bovine serum, as were newborn foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes. In contrast, none of the four melanoma lines responded to hypothalamic preparations containing MGF that consistently produced an approximately 30-fold increase in newborn melanocyte cell yield over a 2-week period. Cholera toxin, required for successful establishment of primary melanocyte cultures, had small and variable effects on the melanoma lines, with slight stimulation in one case, moderate inhibition in another, and essentially no effect in two others. These data suggest that transformation of epidermal melanocytes to melanoma often involves at least one phenotypic change resulting in escape from MGF regulation and another associated with insensitivity to cyclic AMP modulation; while at least some of the pathways conferring serum dependence are unaltered. Improved culture systems for the human epidermal melanocyte should facilitate further studies into the mechanism of its malignant conversion and may provide useful insights for the prevention and treatment of human melanoma. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)DNA, Recombinant 3)Mice",

            "input": "Abstract: Sebaceous wax esters and epidermal acylceramides were isolated from skin surface lipid obtained from children and from young adults. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from the esterified fatty acids of these lipid classes and analyzed to ascertain the proportions of methyl linoleate (18:2 delta 9,12), methyl sebaleate (18:2 delta 5,8), and methyl sapienate (16:1 delta 6). On the same subjects, 2 measures of sebum secretion rate were obtained, namely the sustainable wax ester secretion rate (WESR) on the forehead and the ratio of wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters) [WE/(CH + CE)] in the surface lipid. The proportions of methyl linoleate in FAME from the wax esters decreased, and the proportions of methyl sebaleate increased, with increased rates of sebum secretion. For both methyl linoleate and methyl sebaleate, a better correlation was obtained when the ratio of WE/(CH + CE) was used as a measure of sebum secretion rather than the WESR. The proportions of methyl linoleate in the FAME from the acylceramides were also inversely related to ratios of WE/(CH + CE). In acylceramides, linoleate was replaced by sapienate, a major fatty acid of human sebum. It appears, therefore, that sebum fatty acid composition may change with changes in sebaceous gland activity, and that sebum fatty acids can enter the epidermis and be incorporated into epidermal lipids. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Amino Acid Sequence 2)Granulomatous Disease, Chronic 3)Human",

These samples were dried, extracted with chloroform-methanol mixtures, and the lipids chromatographed on silica gel plates in different solvent systems. After spraying with sulfuric acid and charring, lipids were quantified using a scanning densitometer. It was thus possible to determine lipid concentrations in 12 consecutive epidermal layers, extending 96 microns into the skin. The phospholipids that were characterized all decreased in concentration toward the surface, whereas the neutral lipids and ceramides all increased. Glucosylceramide and acylglucosylceramide reached a peak concentration in the stratum granulosum and then decreased in the surface layers. Cholesterol sulfate reached a maximum concentration in the deeper stratum corneum and then abruptly decreased in the surface layer. These changes in patterns of lipid concentration are consistent with current theories regarding the formation of a water barrier in the stratum corneum that is composed mainly of neutral lipids, and with a possible function of cholesterol sulfate in cellular adhesion in the stratum corneum. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Nuclear Reactors 3)Radioactive Fallout",

            "input": "Abstract: In earlier studies, it was shown that the human plasma-spreading glycoprotein, epibolin (the 65 kD species of serum-spreading factor or vitronectin), requires a second plasma component, termed coepibolin, in order to support maximal dissociated epidermal cell spreading in tissue culture. Whereas epibolin alone in defined medium supports some cell spreading, the purified plasma coepibolin preparations do not effect spreading in the absence of epibolin. Although not yet entirely purified, coepibolin associates with some plasma fractions but not with others; it is certainly not a property of all proteins, e.g., while bovine serum albumin (BSA) has coepibolin activity, ovalbumin does not. The data presented here show that the phorbol ester, 12-tetra-decanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can act as a potent coepibolin and support maximal spreading over a concentration range of 10-100 ng/ml. In the absence of epibolin TPA does not stimulate the spreading of epidermal cells when given alone or in the presence of BSA or ovalbumin. Coepibolin activity appears to associate with tumor-promoting activity in that the phorbol derivative, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, shows coepibolin activity, while its inactive non-tumor-promoting isomer, phorbol-4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, does not. These data suggest that the proteinaceous plasma-derived cofactor acts in a fashion similar to TPA and that this as yet unexplained mechanism of TPA action is important to the full expression of epibolin and to the early phase of epidermal cell spreading. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Moscow 3)New York",

In order to further elucidate the significance of lipids in the water-holding properties, lipids, which were extracted as sebaceous-rich lipids (SL) for the first 10-min acetone/ether treatment and as stratum corneum lipids (SCL) for the additional 30-min treatment, were topically applied daily on lipid-depleted forearm skin which had been pretreated with acetone/ether for 40 min. Two daily applications of the SCL which were solubilized in squalane containing 1% alpha-monomethyl heptadecyl glyceryl ether (GE) caused a significant increase of conductance, accompanied by a marked improvement in the level of scaling as compared with nontreatment or GE/squalane base, whereas the SL in the GE/squalane base did not exhibit any significant recovery in either conductance value or scaling. To clarify which components of the SCL are primarily responsible for the observed recovery of the water-holding properties, chromatographically separated fractions of the SCL were also topically applied in the same manner for 2 successive days. Out of the following separated fractions: cholesterol, cholesterol ester, free fatty acid, glycolipids, and ceramide, 2 daily topical applications of ceramide fraction induced a significant and the highest increase in the conductance value as compared with GE/squalane base. Furthermore, glycolipids and cholesterol fractions also exhibited a significant recovery when compared with no application at all. In contrast, free fatty acid and cholesterol ester fractions did not indicate any significant increase in the conductance value. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that structural lipids present in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum, especially ceramide, play a critical role in the water-holding properties of the stratum corneum. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Antiviral Agents 3)Drug Screening",

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Health Education 3)Human",

Groups of UVB-irradiated BALB/c mice were given an intradermal injection of the mast cell degranulator compound 48/80 into ears at various time intervals (30 min-7 days) after a single exposure to a bank of fluorescent sunlamp tubes (10-100 mJ/cm2). Both the compound-evoked ear swelling response (ESR) and mast cell degranulation were significantly suppressed by preexposure to UVB (25-100 mJ/cm2) after 0 (30 min) to 3 days postirradiation, with a subsequent recovery by day 7. No such effects were observed in mice irradiated with 10 mJ/cm2. The ESR induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine was not significantly affected by UVB radiation during the experimental period. While within this dose range UV radiation itself caused neither loss of mast cell counts nor a measurable degree of degranulation in ear skin, exposure to larger amounts of UV energy (200-500 mJ/cm2) produced tremendous ear swelling with histologic features of mast cell degranulation in an early phase of inflammation. The results suggest that UVB radiation exerts a dual effect on mast cells and that administration of smaller amounts of UVB may alter the mast cell/vasoactive amine system, suppressing ear swelling in response to the degranulator. Vascular reactivities to vasoactive amines were not affected by UVB irradiation. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cell Line 3)Drug Resistance, Microbial",

As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated Merkel cells in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of Merkel cells in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. Merkel cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17-week-old fetus, 17% of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) Merkel cells were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14-week-old fetus only 3.9% of the Merkel cells were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal Merkel cells. Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal Merkel cells per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7- to 9-week embryos, no Merkel cells were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of Merkel cells or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin Merkel cells arise, between weeks 8-12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal Merkel cells detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Antibodies, Monoclonal 3)Mice",

The occurrence of soft hemolysis was analyzed statistically in 6,723 sera. The specificity of soft hemolysis for infection with rubella virus was 99.0%. Its sensitivity in primary infections was 97.3%, and the predictive value for rubella serodiagnosis (increase in IgG level or detectable IgM) was 91.2%. The temporal association of soft hemolysis with rubella was determined with sera obtained from 129 persons during late convalescence (70-310 days after onset of symptoms). Soft hemolysis disappeared by 190 days after the onset of symptoms and the presence of ordinary hemolysis ruled out primary rubella in the preceding 70-100 days. Soft hemolysis was caused by IgG antibody to rubella virus, and thus represents a new serodiagnostic principle. This technique, together with an Igm assay, allows rapid diagnosis of recent rubella from a single serum sample. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Human 2)National Institutes of Health (U.S.) 3)Neoplasms",

Two of them developed acute hepatitis B; the cost of their medical care and temporary disability was $7,772. Eleven seroconverters had no elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase, and all seroconverters recovered without chronic sequelae. Nine converters acquired antibody to HBsAg alone; three of these had no client contact. Difficulty in identifying nonoccupational causes of hepatitis B infection in the institutional setting often leads to labeling of all seroconversions as occupationally acquired. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for client-care personnel. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Human 2)Lymphokines 3)Neoplasms",

The AGN cases were both postpharyngeal and postpyodermal in origin. Despite the fact that ARF and AGN were occurring in the same neighborhoods and among families of equivalent size and socioeconomic status, the pharyngeal isolation rates of group A streptococci were significantly lower among patients with ARF and their household contacts than among patients with AGN and their contacts. Moreover, the streptococcal throat colonization rates and geometric mean anti-streptolysin O titers were similar in ARF families and the families of noninfected controls. Streptococci of M-type 5, a highly rheumatogenic type, were isolated from three patients with ARF (representing 36% of group A isolates from this group) and one ARF contact but never from patients with AGN, control subjects, or their respective contacts. These observations suggest possible differences in the streptococcal milieus from which ARF and AGN cases emerge. The nature of such differences requires further exploration. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Hungary 3)Nuclear Reactors",

Cardiac output and regional blood flow were measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in rats with portal hypertension caused by portal vein stenosis, in rats with end-to-side portacaval shunts, and in sham-operated rats. Cardiac output was significantly higher in rats with surgical shunts than in those of the two other groups and was significantly lower in sham-operated rats compared with portal hypertensive rats. Portal tributary blood flow and hepatic arterial blood flow expressed in absolute flow as well as in percentage of cardiac output were significantly increased in rats with surgical shunts compared with other groups. These blood flows were also significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated animals. A significant correlation was found between cardiac output and portal tributary blood flow in rats with portal vein stenosis and in rats with surgical shunts; this correlation was absent in sham-operated rats. This study shows that the hyperkinetic circulatory state in rats with portal hypertension and a normal liver is related to the presence of portasystemic shunts but not to portal hypertension per se. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents 2)Isotopes 3)Nuclear Reactors",

Previously the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3) was found to be inappropriately low in SHR in view of their ionized hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. We examined the responses of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 to several known stimuli. Baseline plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels tended to be lower in SHR than WKY rats (51.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 82.3 +/- 14.1 pg/ml, P = 0.06). Infusion of a pharmacologic dose of parathyroid hormone (8 U/hr over a period of 17 hours) resulted in a plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 504 +/- 77 pg/ml in SHR vs. 1016 +/- 211 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.03). Cyclic adenosine monophosphate infusion (1 mumol/hr/100 gm over a period of 17 hours) in thyroparathyroidectomized animals resulted in a 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 121 +/- 24 pg/ml in SHR vs. 557 +/- 26 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.01). After dietary phosphorus depletion for 3 weeks, SHR also had lower 1,25(OH)2D3 levels than WKY rats (83 +/- 13 vs. 300 +/- 42 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) even though a comparable degree of hypophosphatemia was achieved. Thus, the response of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels to several known stimuli is submaximal in SHR as compared with WKY rats, suggesting defective synthesis or enhanced metabolic clearance of this hormone. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Human 2)Models, Neurological 3)Motion Perception",

In addition, we noticed a cumulative prolongation of bleeding time by a combination of quinidine and aspirin. We postulated that because both quinidine and aspirin inhibit epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a cumulative effect of the two drugs might be responsible for the hemostatic defect. In studies using normal human platelets, we confirmed a marked reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation by the combination of these two agents. To further study the potential mechanism of this cumulative effect, platelet lysates were incubated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist tritiated yohimbine in the presence of quinidine and aspirin. On the basis of the radioligand binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was observed to increase in the presence of quinidine as well as aspirin. The combination of these two agents caused a marked increase in the KD of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors without alteration in the number of receptor sites. These data suggest that the cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor KD may relate to the significant reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. This phenomenon, coupled with other well-known effects of aspirin on the platelet release reaction and arachidonate metabolism, may lead to bleeding problems in some patients receiving this combination. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Human 3)Research Support",

            "input": "Abstract: Chronic inflammation in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with the accumulation of iron in mononuclear phagocytes. Cigarette smoking, which also produces chronic pulmonary inflammation, may be associated with iron accumulation in alveolar macrophages (AM). We have examined the total iron content in human AM and found it to be 43.0 +/- 7.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 12.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/1 X 10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) from smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Because the higher iron content in smokers' macrophages may reflect increased internalization, the binding and uptake of iron-saturated transferrin was examined in cells from smokers and nonsmokers. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups. The smoking-related alteration in iron content may instead reflect differences in the fate of internalized iron. Iron internalized by AM as iron 59 initially bound to transferrin was distributed to a cytoplasmic, largely ferritin-associated, pool more slowly in smokers than in nonsmokers, during a 24-hour incubation in vitro. Significantly less newly internalized iron was returned to the culture medium by AM from smokers, which by 24 hours had released 11.0% +/- 3.7% of the initially internalized 59Fe compared with 36.0% +/- 2.3% for nonsmokers (P less than 0.01). The increased accumulation of iron by AM in the alveolar space of smokers may modulate hydroxyl radical production in the microenvironment of these cells. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Human 3)India",

The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC. Furthermore, it was suggested that TU infusion at a higher rate significantly interferes with the hepatic uptake (or storage) of BSP. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Biotechnology 2)Insurance, Liability 3)United States.",

The derived microvesicles from each line were as effective as the intact cells in inducing thrombogenesis on both undigested and alpha-chymotrypsin-digested subendothelium. Thrombus size on digested vessels was greater than on undigested vessels by fivefold for SKNMC cells and microvesicles and by 20-fold for U87MG cells and sevenfold for U87MG microvesicles. The results show that microvesicles from both cell lines initiate interactions between platelets and subendothelium identical to those caused by intact tumor cells. The results also demonstrate that intact tumor cells in the circulation may not be necessary for the thromboembolic complications of malignancy. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Child 2)Comparative Study 3)Dental Caries",

Three patient populations were identified for comparison: patients admitted by private family physicians when residents were not involved in patient care, patients admitted by the same family physicians while they served as attending physicians on the family practice service and allowed residents to participate in the care of their patients, and patients admitted by residents from the patient population at the Family Practice Center. After taking into account differences in case mix, an analysis of laboratory charges, radiology use, frequency of procedures, and use of consultants showed that the three groups were not different. Family practice residents managed their own patients as cost effectively as physicians in private practice, which suggests that experience alone is not necessary to develop methods of cost-efficient care. When these two groups were combined into a teaching unit, with few exceptions this efficiency was maintained. These results imply that the introduction of family practice residents into patient care does not invariably increase expenses to the patient. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Cattle 3)Comparative Study",

This study followed the treatment progress of 20 patients for a mean of 39 months after intake. The study included a detailed history, neurological examination, and psychological testing on each patient. At follow-up each patient was interviewed and a questionnaire was completed by his or her therapist to assess treatment response. Although nine patients achieved partial or full integration, complete integration was maintained by only five. During therapy the unintegrated patients experienced emotional trauma at approximately twice the rate as did the patients who eventually became integrated. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and hypnosis were the most widely prescribed therapies. The improvement in multiple personality appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion from acceptance of the diagnosis to integration. The progress of therapy was hindered most commonly by the overuse of the mental mechanisms of repression and denial, the continued utilization of secrecy, which began during child abuse, and the production of numerous crises. The most common countertransferences included anger, exasperation, and emotional exhaustion. Although the psychotherapy of patients with multiple personality is tedious and time consuming, it can be eminently successful if the patient and therapist persevere. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenosine Triphosphate 2)Animal 3)Cell Line",

Dissociation occurs to some degree in normal individuals and is thought to be more prevalent in persons with major mental illnesses. The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) has been developed to offer a means of reliably measuring dissociation in normal and clinical populations. Scale items were developed using clinical data and interviews, scales involving memory loss, and consultations with experts in dissociation. Pilot testing was performed to refine the wording and format of the scale. The scale is a 28-item self-report questionnaire. Subjects were asked to make slashes on 100-mm lines to indicate where they fall on a continuum for each question. In addition, demographic information (age, sex, occupation, and level of education) was collected so that the connection between these variables and scale scores could be examined. The mean of all item scores ranges from 0 to 100 and is called the DES score. The scale was administered to between 10 and 39 subjects in each of the following populations: normal adults, late adolescent college students, and persons suffering from alcoholism, agoraphobia, phobic-anxious disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and multiple personality disorder. Reliability testing of the scale showed that the scale had good test-retest and good split-half reliability. Item-scale score correlations were all significant, indicating good internal consistency and construct validity. A Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc comparisons of the scores of the eight populations provided evidence of the scale's criterion-referenced validity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Aging 2)Amino Acid Sequence 3)Animal",

The maximal rate of underdiagnosis which results from this diagnostic rule was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus. When symptoms attributed to diabetes (total = 296, mean = 2.6 per patient) were discounted, 256 diagnoses were made. Eighteen additional diagnoses (a 6.7% increase) were appreciated when these excluded symptoms were considered as psychiatrically significant; however, only two of these new diagnoses were given to patients previously without a psychiatric diagnosis. The authors concluded that the DIS is sensitive in its detection of psychiatric illness in diabetes and perhaps other physical illnesses as well. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 2)Centers for Disease Control (U.S.) 3)Human",

Patients were followed for 6 to 264 months (mean, 57 months). Twenty six patients (32%) developed clinically definite or probable multiple sclerosis during the period of follow-up. Actuarial analysis predicted that 42% would develop multiple sclerosis by 7 years. Of those patients who developed multiple sclerosis, 92% had symptoms within 4 years of the first attack of optic neuritis. The highest incidence of multiple sclerosis occurred in the 21-40 year age group. There was an increased risk of MS in patients with HLA-DR2 and HLA-B7 tissue types. The frequency of HLA-DR4 was increased in patients with optic neuritis alone compared to controls and to patients with multiple sclerosis, but further studies are required to confirm this finding. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Hepatitis B Surface Antigens 2)Human 3)Recombinant Proteins",

Over the period of two years 51 patients were studied prospectively with this infestation, paying particular attention to the duration and severity of the illness, clinical course, CT findings and therapeutic modalities. Patients with parenchymal cysts or calcification without hydrocephalus had a benign disorder presenting commonly with seizures. This type of infestation usually is long-standing, almost never requires surgical treatment, responds to praziquantel therapy and has a good prognosis. In contrast, patients who present with hydrocephalus, large supratentorial cysts, multiple granulomata with cerebral oedema or with vasculitis and cerebral infarction, have an aggressive, acute or subacute illness, presenting with raised intracranial pressure, gait disturbances, mental changes, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hemisphere syndromes, chronic meningitis and stroke. This malignant form usually requires surgical therapy, does not respond to praziquantel and may produce a fatal outcome or serious sequelae. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acclimatization 2)Altitude 3)Chile",

The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide also increased during viloxazine therapy, but to a lesser extent (16%). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of viloxazine. In a seventh patient, viloxazine had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide levels (by 197% and 137% respectively). Although viloxazine appears to be one of the few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine. The mechanism of the interaction probably involves inhibition of the metabolism of both carbamazepine and its active epoxide metabolite. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Blastoderm 3)Drosophila",

The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic mechanism involved in the generation of VEP delays is sensitive to stimulus spatial frequency. The study of VEPs before and after the administration of haloperidol confirmed this hypothesis. VEP latency did not correlate with the major clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could not predict the results of chronic dopaminergic therapy. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Blastoderm 3)Drosophila",

Stiffness ranged from 0.40 to 1.8 Nm/radian and was strongly correlated (r = 0.85) with upper arm volume, allowing us to define a \"normal\" range for stiffness when corrected for arm volume. In addition, the angle of the elbow with the arm fully relaxed and no external torque applied (\"neutral\" angle) was found to be 107 degrees +/- 10 degrees. Thus, we have quantified resting stiffness or \"tone\" in the arm and provided normal data for comparison with patients with pathophysiological conditions such as rigidity or spasticity. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Cell Line 2)Cell Survival 3)Glioma",

In Parkinsonian versus normal patients (previously reported) it was observed that: the neutral angle in Parkinson's disease patients was significantly smaller (92 degrees +/- 15 degrees) than in normals (107 degrees +/- 10 degrees), and in Parkinson's disease patients, even with relatively mild symptoms, the upper limb was stiffer than normals in the totally relaxed state with no electromyographic activity present. Our results suggest that changes in the passive mechanical properties of the upper limb affected by Parkinsonian rigidity may have taken place, accounting for the more flexed neutral elbow angle and greater passive stiffness. Using this technique, response to antirigidity therapy and natural progression of illness can be quantitatively assessed and followed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Basilar Artery 3)Cerebral Ischemia, Transient",

The overall degree of disability and its fluctuations were close enough in the two groups for fair comparison of changes in affective behaviour. Temporary immobility was accompanied by adverse changes of mood and activation, which were significantly more marked in the Parkinson's disease group than in the controls, though to a lesser extent in those Parkinson's disease patients rated depressed even in their mobile periods. The possible correlation between mood changes and fluctuations of central dopaminergic function in the Parkinson's disease patients is discussed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged",

Empiric correction was made by the computer for the effects of density and viscosity, relative to air, on the flow of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the saturated vapors of the three anesthetics through the capillary resistor. The computer was programmed to control solenoid valves both for calibration and for the multiplexed sampling of operating rooms. Oxygen, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were used as pure gases, and halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were vaporized at room temperature in 50-ml vaporizers.

The clinical usefulness of pulse oximetry in the early recognition of decreased pulmonary blood flow or partial airway obstruction was demonstrated.

            "input": "Abstract: Both halothane and nitrous oxide can be reduced at the cathode of a polarographic oxygen electrode, causing the electrode current to drift upward and report falsely high oxygen tension. Because transcutaneous oxygen tension is measured by a heated oxygen electrode, there is a potential for significant upward drift of these values. To examine the clinical significance of this drift, the following study was performed. Transcutaneous oxygen tension sensors were calibrated at oxygen tensions of 0 mm Hg and 157 mm Hg (room air) just before clinical use during anesthesia. This calibration was rechecked immediately upon removal of the sensor from the patient at the end of the anesthesia. The predominant anesthetic agent used and the duration of monitoring were noted from the record. Data were collected from 208 patients representing a total of 463.6 hours of anesthesia. The patients were divided into five groups based on anesthetic administered: halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, nitrous oxide-narcotic, and local/regional. The mean zero point recalibration value was 0.4 mm Hg or less for all agents except halothane, for which it was 1.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. This halothane drift was significantly greater than that for the other agents (P less than 0.01). Room air recalibration was not significantly different in any of the five groups, varying from 160 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for halothane to 157 +/- 4.9 mm Hg for enflurane. All these drift values are within the manufacturer's specifications. We conclude that the drift of the transcutaneous oxygen tension sensor due to anesthetic agents is not clinically significant. However, caution should be exercised when halothane is used during an extremely long period of anesthesia. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Epidural Space",

The anesthesiologist enters information by touching virtual function keys displayed on the screen. A data window displays all data generated over time, such as automatically recorded vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal and esophageal temperatures, and manually entered variables, such as administered drugs, and ventilator settings. The information gathered by the AIS is presented on the cathode ray tube in several pages. A main distributor page gives an overall view of the content of every work page. A one-page record of the anesthesia is automatically plotted on a multicolor digital plotter during the operation. An example of the use of the AIS is presented from a field test of the system during which it was evaluated in the operating room without interfering with the ongoing operation. Medical staff who used the AIS imitated the anesthesiologist's recording and information search behavior but did not have responsibility for the conduct of the anesthetic. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Brain Neoplasms 3)Case Report",
