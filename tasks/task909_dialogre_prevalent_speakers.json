You'll be in college next year, so you better have decided by then. \nSpeaker 1:  None of those options sound appealing to me, though.

Monica! \nSpeaker 4: Ross, are you okay? \nSpeaker 2: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today. \nSpeaker 4: Why?! \nSpeaker 2: On account of my rage. \nSpeaker 3: Which I may say, right now, is out of control. \nSpeaker 2: He gave me a pill for it. \nSpeaker 4: A pill? \nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.
