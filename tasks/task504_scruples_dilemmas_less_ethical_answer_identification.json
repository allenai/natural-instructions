		"Answer Identification"
	],
	"Definition": "Given a pair of action statements, identify which one is less ethical, that is, which of the statements is morally less right.",
	"Positive Examples": [
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: calling my mother a bitch during her birthday party ACTION2: starting a fight over pizza",
			"output": "calling my mother a bitch during her birthday party",
			"explanation": "Saying inappropriate things to one's mother on her special occasion is very rude. On the other hand, starting a fight over pizza often happens among friends and most of the time harmless. So the first action is much less ethical than the second."
		},
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: not knowing anything about computers ACTION2: taking my son's PS4 he bought himself",
			"output": "taking my son's PS4 he bought himself",
			"explanation": "taking son's object which he bought himself with his own money is insensitive and might hurt his feelings. On the other hand, not knowing something can be dealt with by learning further and does not harm others in any ways. So the second action is less ethical than the first"
		}
	],
	"Negative Examples": [
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: being angry at some one canceling last minute ACTION2: quitting a volunteer position after completing the training",
			"output": "being angry at some one canceling last minute",
			"explanation": "Quiting a position after completing the training process may hurt the organization who have trained the person. On the other hand, there is quite logical to be angry at someone who cancel plans at the last minitue. So the second action is less ethical."
		},
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: telling my manager to call corporate on my coworker because she smells terrible ACTION2: hiding that I speak another language from my so",
			"output": "hiding that I speak another language from my so",
			"explanation": "Complaining to superior about co-worker is often not the right thing to do whereas speaking another language is a skill and hiding that fact does not hurt someone. Hence the first action is less ethical than the second"
		}
