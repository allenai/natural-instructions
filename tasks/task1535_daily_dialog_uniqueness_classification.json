Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . \nPerson2: Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . \nPerson1:     Which team do you back then ? \nPerson2: I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . \nPerson1:     But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . ",

Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . \nPerson1:     It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . \nPerson2: Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . \nPerson1:     How do you think they could be ended ? \nPerson2: I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . \nPerson1:     So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . \nPerson2: It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . \nPerson1:     Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . \nPerson2: The problem is that many poor people might suffer . ",

It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . \nPerson2: Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! \nPerson1:     What other activities will you have tomorrow ? \nPerson2: Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . \nPerson1:     Do you bring some gifts along ? \nPerson2: That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . \nPerson1:     Is it the same practice for all families ? \nPerson2: Not all the same nowadays I must say .

We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . \nPerson1:     I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings .

So much pollution from cars . \nPerson2: Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . \nPerson1:     Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . \nPerson2: Why do you say \" have to \" ? \nPerson1:     Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . \nPerson2: Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . \nPerson1:     Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . \nPerson2: Do you want me to give you a ride ? \nPerson1:     No , no problem .

We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . \nPerson2: What does that mean ? \nPerson1:     Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . \nPerson2: Me ! Me ! \nPerson1:     Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . \nPerson2: Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! \nPerson1:     Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . \nPerson2: Well , OK . But no French kissing ! \nPerson1:     As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again .

You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? \nPerson2: Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . \nPerson1:     Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? \nPerson2: Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . \nPerson1:     Feed them ? \nPerson2: Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . \nPerson1:     And then later everyone eats the food ? \nPerson2: Yes ! How did you guess that ? \nPerson1:     It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? \nPerson2: Good Point ! \nPerson1:     But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? \nPerson2: No !

Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . \nPerson2: Scraping is too terrifying .

It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . \nPerson1:     II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . \nPerson2: Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . \nPerson1:     In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . \nPerson2: I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage .

What about you ? \nPerson1:     I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . \nPerson2: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . \nPerson1:     Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . \nPerson2: But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? \nPerson1:     Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . \nPerson2: I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? \nPerson1:     That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . \nPerson2: Really ? \nPerson1:     Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . \nPerson2: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? \nPerson1:     Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . \nPerson2: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? \nPerson1:     That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . \nPerson2: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? \nPerson1:     Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . \nPerson2: Why did they want to found a college ? \nPerson1:     Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . \nPerson2: Oh , I see . \nPerson1:     Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . \nPerson2: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? \nPerson1:     In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . \nPerson2: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . \nPerson1:     Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . \nPerson2: Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . \nPerson1:     Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . \nPerson2: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . \nPerson1:     Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . \nPerson2: That ’ s right .

I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? \nPerson2: Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . \nPerson1:     Why can't I call the police now ?

What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . \nPerson2: Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing .

It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? \nPerson2: Cinct de mayo ? \nPerson1:     No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . \nPerson2: Do we get a day off from school then ? \nPerson1:     No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . \nPerson2: Www , man ! \nPerson1:     In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . \nPerson2: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? \nPerson1:     Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . \nPerson2: And then what happened ? \nPerson1:     Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",
