Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . \nPerson2: Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . \nPerson1:     Which team do you back then ? \nPerson2: I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . \nPerson1:     But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . ",

Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . \nPerson1:     It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . \nPerson2: Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . \nPerson1:     How do you think they could be ended ? \nPerson2: I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . \nPerson1:     So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . \nPerson2: It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . \nPerson1:     Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . \nPerson2: The problem is that many poor people might suffer . ",

My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . \nPerson2: The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . \nPerson1:     They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's \" chi \" . \nPerson2: But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? \nPerson1:     The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . \nPerson2: Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . \nPerson1:     This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . \nPerson2: Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . \nPerson1:     This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . \nPerson2: Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself .

He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . \nPerson2: You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ?

What about you ? \nPerson1:     I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . \nPerson2: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . \nPerson1:     Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . \nPerson2: But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? \nPerson1:     Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . \nPerson2: I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? \nPerson1:     That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . \nPerson2: Really ? \nPerson1:     Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . \nPerson2: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? \nPerson1:     Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . \nPerson2: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? \nPerson1:     That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . \nPerson2: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? \nPerson1:     Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . \nPerson2: Why did they want to found a college ? \nPerson1:     Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . \nPerson2: Oh , I see . \nPerson1:     Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . \nPerson2: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? \nPerson1:     In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . \nPerson2: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . \nPerson1:     Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . \nPerson2: Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . \nPerson1:     Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . \nPerson2: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . \nPerson1:     Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . \nPerson2: That ’ s right .

I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? \nPerson2: Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . \nPerson1:     Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! \nPerson2: Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . \nPerson1:     I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . \nPerson2: Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . \nPerson1:     Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . ",

Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . \nPerson2: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? \nPerson1:     Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . \nPerson2: And then what happened ? \nPerson1:     Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

In New Berlin ? \nPerson1:     No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch .

People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . \nPerson2: And the second stage is called a tornado warning . \nPerson1:     Yes .

Others aren't so fast . \nPerson2: Have you seen a lot of them ? \nPerson1:     I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . \nPerson2: Did it hit their house ? \nPerson1:     No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . \nPerson2: What were they doing when you called ? \nPerson1:     They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . \nPerson2: That's terrible .
