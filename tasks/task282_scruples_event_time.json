So would I be an asshole if I confronted her and told her to cut the crap and just be straight with me so that I don’t waste the time and energy trying to make things work if she doesn’t want to go? Also do I have any right to be upset since even though my gut tells me she is just being flaky, she is also a very busy person so there is a chance that I’m just overly sensitive.",

I woke up at 8:00 A.M (when class started) and rushed to put on clothes and bike to the school.  I got there around 8:05-8:10 and found another substitute teacher talking to my mentor teacher.

Which is why I never went to my senior prom.\n\nIts overpriced, you REQUIRE a nice outfit, and to top it off neither of us go to the school anymore. I've given her all these points and yet she still wants to go. We did, however, go to the homecoming last year. Let me tell you, I've never been more disappointed with my school and you have gym teachers getting arrested for sexual conduct with students here. \n\nShe was upset about the homecoming being bad too and I just know that prom going to be exactly the same way because there is no way our school makes enough money for a proper dance. So what do all think? Am I wrong for not wanting to go to a dance with my her? I'd rather spend the night at somewhere that would actually be fun. Perhaps a nightly beach walk or something.",

We've constantly had arguments with each other and she even started feeling like we weren't meant to be. So the 3rd time I broke it off, I felt sure I wasn't going to be with her, as I had no emotions. This was due to the fact that she is extremely selfish and wouldn't even console me when I was in a bad state. She then started to say things like I'll kill myself if you leave me, or she couldn't get attracted to other men. Being the asshole that I am, I decide to stick with her to make sure she stays safe, but I've really had enough at that point. Fast forward a few weeks later and the lies ensue. I face my fear of having a death on my soul and just tell her I've had enough with the lies, I break it off for the last time and she's quiet for a few days. She hasn't killed herself at that point as I've seen her online and she's tried to message me, (I've blocked her everywhere). Then I get messages from her on Instagram somehow, saying she'll actually kill herself, and I replied with \"well atleast you won't be able to hurt anyone\".......\nI'm not familiar with Instagram but I think if their profile picture disappears they've blocked you?

Also, sorry if my writing is poor, but I'm kinda just writing off the cuff.\n\nMy dad recently got with a new girlfriend, and she's nice and all, but she's been talking a LOT about moving out of the country, even by next year. And my dad seems to be really into it, so I'm pretty sure it's a certainty.\n\nThey're talking about moving to France, and France is nice and all, but I don't know. I kinda like America, and I feel like I haven't stayed in one place for more than a year for a while. Either I move schools, or I move grades, or I move states. I'm always moving, I haven't made friends that last more than a year besides a couple internet friends (that I've drifted from quite a bit) since third grade, and through that the only stable thing in my life has been the country I live in. No matter how much shit had changed all the time, at least I've been in my home country, where almost everyone speaks the same language as me, and have around the same mannerisms and expressions.\n\nI feel like one of the only things familiar to me will be ripped away, and that's scary. Especially with article 13 coming soon, I wouldnt be able to access most of the YouTube channels I love to watch, and that's my main source of entertainment and coping mechanism for sad times.\n\nSo in moving to France, I would be giving up the only familiar thing in my life, my country, language, and culture, as well as giving up my main source of entertainment and coping mechanism. I don't know how I would continue living.\n\n But is it right for me to hold my parents back like this? If their dream is to constantly move around, who am I to hold them back? I would feel terrible if I held them back and made them unhappy. But then again, I've always been going with the flow whenever we have to move and just being okay with it, even when it's destroyed me. When is it time to be selfish and think about my own happiness?\n\nHonestly, I see only a couple possible futures for me and none of them look happy.\n\n1: I move to France, and then inevitably move again in another year or so, and spend the rest of my life with no real friends or connections.\n2: I don't move with my dad, and move in with my mom (which is a non option, really. Long story)\n3: I put my foot down and refuse to move, which will either result in option 1 or me holding my parents back from happiness and feeling guilty forever.\n\nI don't know anymore, and I'm so confused.

            "input": "Some years ago my husband and I built a DIY patio behind our house. We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt.

Unlike a lot of people I've never had any issues with my (soon-to-be) in-laws before - in fact my fiance's parents quite liked me the handful of times we've met, and we've always gotten along. The shit realllllllly hit the fan this past weekend though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my fiance travels a lot for work and was out of town for about a week-ish. During the weekend his mother was planning to come for her annual visit (we live near Phoenix AZ, she lives in San Diego CA) and was going to stay in our guestroom for a few days until he returned from his trip so we could all spend time together. The first day was fairly good, we went out to lunch and watched her favorite gameshow for a while, chatted about random stuff. We'd never gotten to know each other very well or spent time alone together so it was somewhat awkward, but it was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then the second day when we go out to lunch is when things start going downhill... see, MIL is nice and all but is very naive and gullible, to put it nicely. She could hear something on the radio and immediately take it as truth without any sort of fact-checking or research on her own, which is something that's even gotten my fiance rather irritated with her on occasion. She is also very stubborn and likes to talk a LOT, so she will always give you her blunt opinion. And on top of this, she is a staunch Trump supporter and wants the wall built ASAP, because she believes \"all the illegal immigrants in San Diego are the cause of all the traffic\". Needless to say, I don't exactly share her views. Which that in itself isn't a problem, I've known she's rather conservative and made it a point to avoid politics as a topic of conversation so as not to cause any conflict. However, she wants to talk about anything and everything with me, and with the current political climate and government shutdown in place, she's very enthusiastic to discuss it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe begins asking me questions about my views regarding the shutdown, the wall, Trump, etc. I say I'd rather not talk about something like that but she insists, adding how ridiculous she thinks it is that \"Democrats won't fund the wall to keep our country safe\". I'm desperately trying to avoid giving my honest opinion and instead try to talk about something else, but she keeps poking at me \"oh come on, tell me what you think! Don't you think we should stop illegal aliens from entering our country?\" like she's expecting me to agree with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly she wasn't budging, so I just say I don't think the wall is a good idea and that Trump is causing even more damage than good to the country with this shutdown (Sidenote: my father works a government job and has been without pay during this period, so it's a bit of an extra touchy subject for me). Immediately her expression goes from an eager grin to completely stone-faced. I go on saying that most illegal immigrants come in through airplanes anyway and just overstay their visas so a wall wouldn't stop that, and she goes off saying that's not true because she heard this from Breitbart or that on Fox News and the president tweeted this and that and it's all the Democrats fault and blah blah. Which again, if that's your opinion then fine - I tend to respect others' opinions as long as they do the same for me. But she goes on this tirade trying to \"educate\" me and how I shouldn't by into the lies of liberal media or whatever. When she finally stops to take a breath I quickly say \"clearly we aren't going to agree about this so let's just not talk about it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that quieted her down... for about 30 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she starts mumbling about how I must've gotten my views from my mother (who is in fact quite liberal) and that it's so unfortunate that I've bought into all this false information and that we disrespect our president and country so much. Obviously this struck a nerve with me now that she's brought my mother into this, whom she's only met twice and my mother knows they have opposing views but has never said a bad word about her. So flat-out tell her that I'd like her to stop, I don't agree with her views and especially knowing how much my father is struggling to pay bills right now she's the one being rude while staying under my roof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis only offended her further, and eventually it just got to the point where I asked her to leave and stay with her friend in town or a hotel for the remainder of her trip. She was completely shocked and initially refused to leave, saying she had a right to be here because this was her son's house too and he invited her here (although she's never actually invited, she just randomly calls up and says \"hey I'm coming to stay from X day to Y day!\" but that hasn't been a problem since we only see her once a year and we shift our schedules around if needed). I tell her it's my house as well and she's no longer welcome to stay here if she's going to insult my family and argue with me over something as simple as a different viewpoint. So she huffs and gathers her stuff, gets in her car and drives off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely have a few minutes to take a breath and process everything that just happened when I get a call from my fiance, angry that I kicked his mother out of our home. I figured she probably just gave him one side of the story and spun it in her favor, so I explain what happened but he insists she would've calmed down if I just let her vent, and that I shouldn't have told her to leave. This irritated me and I said she's not welcome while I'm here alone and that she'll be staying elsewhere, which of course he wasn't happy about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I barely spoke the rest of the time he was out of town, and he was still fairly annoyed when I picked him up at the airport. He was especially upset because apparently his mother had left for San Diego early because of the incident, so he missed out on seeing her. Now that we've had some time to talk about it he understands my point of view, but since he sees his mom so rarely he can't help but feeling down about it and I'm left questioning my decision and feeling very guilty. I've considered contacting her to apologize even though I really feel like I shouldn't - in fact I've thought about barring her from the wedding altogether if this continues to be a persistent issue between us, because god forbid she starts drama with myself or my family at my own wedding. I'm not sure how to feel about this, so I'll leave it up to the fellow Redditers to determine if I'm the asshole.",

Well yesterday we had one of those arguments and it put both of us in a bad mood. We end up making up, we have dinner together, watch TV everything seems fine. So we go to bed. Usually I initiate sex but tonight she does. Our usual routine with sex is foreplay and such, until she cums, then we start having sex. Well no matter what I did she couldn’t cum and this probably went on for 20 to 30 min. So she gets annoyed and says “I’m not going to cum, I’m going to bed goodnight” and rolls over. She says it with kind of an attitude. Now she’s extremely wet, and up until this point everything was pointing in the direction of sex. So I’m like what the fuck and I say “are you serious, are you really going to tease me and then just go to bed”. So I roll over and a minute or two passes by and then she rolls back over initiates again. And we start having sex. And I ask “is this pitty sex?” She says “yes”. So I said “fuck this” stop having sex and go take a shower. When I get back we have a little argument she calls me an “asshole” I say “I’m not having fucking pitty sex”, we end up going to bed. This morning we apologize to each other. I still wanna talk about it when we both get home from work but I’m still confused about the whole situation\n\nI feel like she could’ve easily still been into it, or could have cum later during sex and that her abruptly turning over and giving me attitude because I couldn’t make her cum is kind of a dick move. I also think she got in her own head, because I can almost always make her cum and that it wasn’t my fault to begin with. But then again me getting mad at her for not wanting to have sex and getting even more annoyed because of pitty sex is also kind of a dick move. I don’t know what to think. \n\nSo who is the asshole? \n",

I have many male and female friendships developed in the usual ways - work colleagues, sport, social groups, kids parents etc. \n\nAt one past employer, I got close to a female peer / colleague. We had a relatively close relationship insofar as we would often lunch together, grab a drink after work in our group, and generally hang out. \n\nI left the job to go elsewhere, as did she. We did however stay in touch - regular text/email, the odd lunch catch up - basically friends...we were very comfortable with each other and I really felt she was a good friend. We both shared a lot of personal information. \n\nShe moved away (only a state / 1 hour flight away) with her partner, and had a child. Two years pass.\n\nAfter a number of false starts (I was going to visit / work schedules not aligning) she finally plans a trip to her home city (her family is also here)\n\nWe schedule a lunch for a Friday. ( I'm actually pretty happy with that and schedule a half day off work) She bails and asks to move our catch up to Monday. Sure thing - family stuff will likely be required - I can juggle my schedule and move to Monday.\n\nOn the Sunday, I get a message from my friend asking \"how long our lunch will take\" on Monday as she is keen on setting up a date with an ex partner. Basically a booty call.  Her relationship has not been in a good place for some time.\n\nThe inference being that our catch up was holding her back from hooking up with an ex.\nI get pretty offended. I make my excuses for the lunch, and avoid any chance to reschedule while she is in the city.\n\nHer trip ends, and she returns interstate.\nI receive one further friendly email as if nothing has happened. I don't respond and have made no attempt to contact again. \n\nI have blocked her number and email. AITA.\n\n",

I said I realized school can be stressful but if she is literally crying everyday maybe she should reevaluate why she is there or at least see a therapist as to why she feels the need to break into tears at least once a day. Of course I was told I was being insensitive and that I would never know the stress and pressures of going to grad school. Full discourse I did go to undergrad so I’m not completely out of the loop when it comes to academics but in no way did I cry everyday. She then brought up my military service and claimed I would never tell a war veteran with PTSD the same. Well I know plenty of vets with PTSD and not a single one cry everyday either. I just feel like these people are trying to make their graduate experience seem like a trial by fire when there is literally millions of people who have done it without all the dramatics. I asked a friend with two masters (both from Virginia Tech and yes he was there when the massacre happened) and not even he cried more that once. I’m not trying to prove to anyone I’m a tough guy and yes, I have cried plenty of times before. But I believe if you are truly crying everyday or even a few times a week you need to seek help.

She basically leaves at 7 and returns at 4, and I'm so much attached to her that I basically spend all my day waiting for her to return. It's been a couple of days she's returning home late, at 6 mostly. Like always she texts me that she's back home, but these few days she says she's tired and that's it. She doesn't text me at all for a few hours and just texts me back at night as if nothing's happened. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I don't get why she doesn't even text me saying that she'll get some sleep and then text me after waking up. She wakes up, does her shopping for dinner, goes to her friend comes back and then texts me saying what I have been up to. So today I've had enough so I said i was sad and mad that she didn't text me saying she'd sleep and didn't text me after waking up. I said that I'd text her tomorrow because I was not in a good mood today. I'd be happy to hear her out tomorrow and accept it if I was overreacting and maybe she was really tired and i would be the asshole then for not seeing it through her perspective. But she kept on spamming me hearts and kiss emojis, which to me was very annoying. I proceeded to tell her that her way of approaching and handling this situation was making it worse and we should just call it a day and go to sleep. She kept texting me saying why I had to be mad about small things like these, she also said that atleast she texted back despite the fact it being late. I didn't want to ignore her, but I was pretty much very annoyed so I still calmly said you're just forcing me to talk and its making it worse to which she replied that she didn't know how trying to handle the situation is making it worse and asked why I was thinking like that. \"I don't have anybody else except for you to talk to\", that's what she said. So I said \"bro\" and was typing out my message that this isn't okay at all but she quickly replied with \"yes sis\" which might would've been her attempt at trying to be funny but I honestly had enough. All i asked for was time and space which isn't even much as I said I'd text her back in the morning and it was 9 here already. She said \"Go on then, text me back when you're mood is good. What can I do? Me speaking seems to only make the situation worse and annoy you.\" She said this in our language with much respect so this was very sarcastic and this is only a rough translation. I was pretty annoyed. I said you don't have to say that as a reply to her \"take rest\". So she started to rant again \"Who am I to you anyways.. and blah blah blah\", so I just blocked her for now.\n\nI will text her back in the morning but I don't know if what i did was a good approach to this situation. I don't even know if the title is right for this but I'd really appreciate you guys' take on this. Thanks.",

We are required to give 2 weeks notice, so that's exactly what I did. I explained to my boss that I'd found a better paying job elsewhere and would be leaving. He asked me why and I explained that it was simply due to my workplaces refusal to give me holiday time I was due.\n\nAs employees we're entitled to 4 weeks off a year, spanning from April to April. If you don't use them within that time period then you just lose them, but if you leave employment in that time you're entitled to be payed all the days you didn't take. I have three weeks. My job has a policy of only four people off at any one time, 3 employees and one manager. The problem is we're a building of 50+ employees so unless you get them all booked right away you'll always have people off on the days you want. \n\nNow you might be thinking 'well you should just book them earlier'. While you're correct in thinking that, I have to work around my parents schedules too, so when they go on vacations I come home and look after my younger brother and sister. I don't mind this, they're great kids so I'm happy to do it. \n\nAnyway, as I still have three weeks left and I ended up losing two weeks last year for the same reasons, I figured I could take two weeks off, be happy with that and just lose a week. Nope ,can't be done. My boss has told two others to take two weeks off so he has to say no to me, so he's doing me to lose paid time off the second year in a row.\n\nOkay so onto the meat of this tale. I got a new job, have handed in my two weeks notice and I start on the 18th of \nFebruary. My boss pulls my aside yesterday and asks if I'd be willing to go down to working one day a week until April, as it means he gets a £3,000 bonus for staff retention year to year. If I leave it means we've lost too many people and he doesn't get the bonus. I told my boss that I'd be happy to work one Saturday a week(my new job is Mon-Fri) until mid March on the condition that he gives me my three weeks paid vacation from March-April and that he not change my contract as it means id get paid less for the time taken off, as id be classed as part time from then on and wouldn't be paid as I would've before.\n\nI thought this was a fair request, given that I get paid for the time if I leave anyway, and this way we'd both still get what we want. Nope, my boss loses his sh*t, telling me I'm blackmailing him and what I was requesting was fraud and is illegal. Now I'm not a lawyer, I have no idea if thats true, it just seemed like an idea that I could leave and he'd still receive his bonus. I told him that if he didn't agree to that then I'd be leaving at the end of my notice period at that would be it. He stormed off and the only thing he's said to me since was a snide comment when my colleagues were talking about work he told me 'its not your problem anymore is it?' when I chimed in with a comment.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole for how I 'blackmailed' my boss. I don't think I am to make it clear, but all his comments has really made me wonder.\n",

I have helped her plan parts of the trip and was completely on board until this past weekend when she sent me the detailed itinerary of the plans. I’ve been busy these past few weeks and I know she’s been working with ironing out the details with another one of her bridesmaids. \n\nSo the new details I learned this weekend that are making me want to back out were:\n\n1. We’re going away for two nights, not one. I have a full time job and a three year old. My husband is extremely hands on with our son and is totally capable of and will be happy to take care of him for two nights by himself. But I’ve never spent a night away from our son and I am not sure I want to do it now. I think it’s a lot to ask of my husband. Especially because my friend, as much as I love her, is not the most sacrificing by nature and would never do things that don’t fit into her normal life/routine for me. So I don’t want to go out of my way for her. \n\n2. There are going to be 15 people there, none of who I am super fond of or have anything in common with. I’ve met them a few times over the last 3-4 years and while they were okay to have a brief chat with over dinner, spending 2 days with them seems like A LOT to handle. I initially thought it’ll be just the bridesmaids so like 4-5 of us. \n\n3. They have plans to go clubbing one of the nights and I just don’t do that. Probably the only person in the group who doesn’t. I don’t drink and going clubbing with 15 people with who I have nothing in common just sounds quite unpleasant. \n\n4. I’m pregnant and will be 4-months along in April. This adds to the whole not wanting to go clubbing and on long hikes (I haven’t gone hiking in 3+ years) with a large group of women that I’m not friends with. Hiking features a lot in the planned itinerary. \n\n5. It’s going to be pricey and I’m not comfortable spending a huge amount of money on a weekend that I know I wouldn’t enjoy. I would actually be happier giving that money to my friend as an add-on to her wedding gift. \n\nSo how selfish am I being? My plan is to offer that instead of driving there on Friday night, I can drive up there on Saturday and be there for a photoshoot, lunch, hangout and dinner that she has planned and then drive back home. They have a few things planned for Sunday that I’ll miss but I’m okay with that. ",

I adore my grandma so I’ll do anything to make her happy. When my grandmas at the bingo she’s a completely different woman, I’ve never seen her so happy, she walks (with her walking trolly for support) faster than I’ve ever seen, she smiles, gets all excited and it just makes my entire day.\n\nToday I took her as I always take her the first day after my payday so that I can play along side her (even though I have absolutely no clue what the hell I’m doing), everything was going as normal, I was losing money in confusion, my grandma was somehow winning constantly as always and we were having fun, about half way through the day another lady sat behind us, I see this lady quite a lot and she’s there every time I’m there, her friend came with her and they sat right behind us and spent the whole time chatting super loudly. \n\nNow I’m not sure if any of you have ever gone to bingo but being able to hear the speaker is vital in order to play, and the usual expectation is that everyone should keep quiet or should speak quietly. But because of them chatting about how the bus driver wasn’t white, and what groceries they bought that morning my grandma was struggling to hear the speaker and I could see she was starting to not enjoy our day. \n\nI decided to not say anything as I know this lady was just catching up with a friend, but after 2 hours of constant talking (they weren’t playing at all) I decided to turn around and I politely said “would you be able to keep your voice down my grandma can’t hear the speaker and she’s trying to play” the lady looked at me, didn’t respond and went back to her conversation, I decided to let it slide as I didn’t fancy arguing with someone 3 times my age, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she didn’t understand me, about an hour later my grandma got irritated and went “ Yap Yap Yap that’s what they sound like”, my grandma says things like that sometimes without realising, it’s just how she is now because of her dementia and she can’t help it, evidently the lady heard us because she turned and started having a go at my grandma who didn’t understand what was going on so I said “ if you kept quiet then my grandma wouldn’t mock you, so I suggest you shut up, keep quiet, play what you came here for and leave her alone” to be fair to her the lady did as I said and they kept their voices down. \n\nAfter we left I felt awful, I just feel guilty for being rude but I did what I had to to make sure my grandma was okay, AITA?

            "input": "I'll be short and sweet here. My SIL lives next door and is kind of a shitty cat owner. She feeds and shelters them, but emotionally neglects them to the point where one cat ran away and lives with a neighbor across the street now, and her other cat basically moved in with us, but goes home for the odd feeding. Husband and I are big cat people, so we always showed affection to their cat when it came over and thus, the unofficial adoption. To be honest, her cat is kinda annoying and our cat isn't a fan, and I wish he didn't like us so much, but what can you do. \n\nAnyway, about 6 months ago I noticed her cat loosing weight, despite eating a ton of food at our house and at her house. Deduced it was diabetes. Mentioned to her he was skinny, kept hinting he should see a vet, even weighed him and proved he was loosing weight and still she dragged her feet about taking him to the vet. \n\nNow they don't make a lot of money, but enough for a vet, and plus don't own pets if you can't take care of them. Anyway she is aggressively cheap and I just knew it was about money so I offered to pay half if she took him to the vet. She immediately agrees, makes an appt, takes him to the vet, they run a bunch of tests and treat him for a few things, to the tune of $400. I pay my half as promised, with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part.\n\nFast forward a few months and her cat is doing much better. Weight is back on and then some. Still spends 90% of it's time chilling at our house. I mean, he sleeps in our bed. \n\nHere is where I am thinking of potentially entering asshole territory: her grandma died over the summer, shortly after the vet trip, and she just now received an unexpected inheritance of around $30k. I would never expect her to pay me back normally, but now that she has this big windfall, would I be a jerk if I asked her to kick me back the money I paid for her cat? \n\nSorry I lied at the beginning and said this would be short and sweet. Anyway, debating asking for the money, but curious on what you all think. \n\n",

That turned out to be a lie. r/BikiniBottomTwitter was pretty pissed off about it, with everyone posting memes about their disappointment, but it was all rather humorous and generally fun. That's why I'm on that sub in the first place, I don't care much for Spongebob, but it's funny. Well, I saw a comment saying something to the effect of \"I bet the Marroon 5 subreddit is going to get a lot of shit for this.\" I thought, \"You know, they probably are. I wonder what's happening there?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I check out r/Maroon5, and it's just this tiny 750ish subscriber dead fansub. However, there were two posts already on it from Spongebob fans. One of them was an angry troll saying \"fuck maroon 5,\" but the other one was a humorous picture of the Pitchfork Salesman from... whichever episode of Spongebob featured a pitchfork salesman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what I expected was mostly posts of the latter sort: teasing, but ultimately good natured meme posts. I decided to post one like it in the name of fake internet points. It said \"Don't mind me, I'm just here to watch Spongebob fans burn this place to the ground.\" My post was third out of what turned out to be hundreds, and I got like 2000 upvotes. However, the ensuing shitstorm was NOT the jokes I was expecting, but mostly variants on \"fuck maroon 5.\" It was uuuuuuugly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my moral quandary is this: was I part of the problem, and if so, how much? I got there before the brigade really became a \"brigade,\" but my post certainly could be viewed as actual encouragement to \"burn this place to the ground,\" and really I knew that it was always possible that people would get mean.",

We don't really talk much apart from when we're drunk, but she has been slightly flirty with me, despite both of us having a partner. She knows that I could never cheat on my girlfriend (C's friend who is also a classmate tried really hard to make me go home with her a few months back), however C stated: \"I know that if we didn't both had partners, then we definitely would've hooked up by now\". I think C is smart, funny and good looking, so I replied that we should make a pact; whenever one of us is single, then we'll message each other for a hook up to which she agreed with.\n\nNow I told this to my best friend, and he told me that he found it slightly \"bad mannered\", a break of trust and a gatekeeping for being unfaithful, and stated that it's kind of \"assuming you won't be with your girlfriend for a long time\". I was honestly lost for words, because I can see what he means, but I honestly didn't think that much of it. Both C and I meant what we said when we agreed, but I yeah, idk. This is my first relationship ever, and the pact just seemed like a fun thing to do.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm being a complete asshole without realising it.",

            "input": "TL;DR: I have done a ridiculous amount of research into things my brother's boyfriend has told me and my brother and have not found a single thing to be true. My brother is clueless. I've breached some trust here and fallen down a bit of a rabbit hole, AITA? And can I confront my brother about this asshole without him hating me?\n\nSorry for how long this is but this is some Dirty John shit and it needs some explaining. My \\[24F\\] brother David \\[27M\\] has been dating Kyle \\[29M\\] for about six months and immediately I thought something was off about him. Despite only being 27 (later found out his actual age is \\~29) he claimed he was a VP at a MAJOR company and that this company flew him places in private chartered jets and gave him a beautiful, giant apartment in a downtown area. This was despite him constantly (during working hours!) being at my brother's apartment, and my brother never once sending me a Snapchat or any other picture from them hanging out at his place. Early on in their relationship David actually confronted him about how he felt it was weird he'd never been to his apartment, and Kyle fed him some shit about how he just didn't feel \"emotionally connected\" to the apartment because he was going to be quitting his job at MAJOR company soon to pursue a law degree. And David bought that for some reason! After I pointed out that it still didn't seem right, David would get hostile or outright change the subject when I would bring it up. \n\nFast forward to Christmas where David asked us if he could bring Kyle home to my parents house as a show of support from us about his new relationship. I still had my reservations about him, but I went in with an open mind. The week was an absolute nightmare. He was incredibly negative and outright rude to me and my parents but David didn't seem to notice at all. But that isn't the point of this post. What he also did the whole weekend is just make up some insane fucking lies that while I could not immediately debunk in the moment, I have since debunked. Here are the best:\n\n* **He claims to have played basketball at a very well known college for basketball.** I'm talking Elite Eight well known. I debunked this before we even met him with a look at their readily available online roster from the year he claimed to play.\n* **He claims to have received a full ride scholarship, despite only playing for one year and was allowed to keep the full ride scholarship after he quit playing.** No injury involved, he just \"wasn't feeling it.\" I asked my boyfriend's brother who plays college sports on scholarship if this is something he had ever heard of, and he laughed in my face and said no. \n* **He claims to have attended an elite school (not Ivy but one of the best in the country) and graduated with a BS and a Master's with NO DEBT.** (he later mocked me and my brother for having student loans, so charming.) I debunked this by finding the commencement list online from the years he could have graduated. This one has room for error, because people can be left off a program, but still. \n* **Once again, claimed to be a VP at a Major Company.** I asked my boyfriend's dad, who is a VP at a smaller company, if that were possible and if any of the perks he described were possible, and he said no. \n* **He claimed to have a pilot's license.** This was a big ol' fuckup because my dad works for the FAA and he checked the database and he ain't on it. \n* **He claimed to have been accepted to Yale Law school with the option to defer for five years.** I talked to my best friend who is currently in law school whether she'd ever heard of a five year deferment, and she said someone in his family had to be dying for him to even get a one year deferment. And it's still rare. \n\nThese are the greatest hits and the best stuff I have to go off of. Aside from this stuff, he's incredibly manipulative and possessive. I talked to one of his friends (Amanda) and she said she hadn't seen David in like a month because Kyle doesn't like her and insults her constantly. (She has been debunking his lies for a long time.) At the moment, David is away in Africa on his dream vacation for another week. He has left his apartment keys, his car keys and his dog to Kyle to watch. Kyle told David before he left that he would keep the dog at \"his place\" (which I don't think exists) and just keep his keys for safe keeping. But while he's been gone, Amanda and her husband have walked by her home every other night while walking their dog and saw Kyle inside on the couch. My dad and mom were going to be in the city for a conference and asked if they could stay at David's apartment instead of a hotel, and Kyle said he wasn't in town to give them the keys. Sure enough they show up at David's apartment and Kyle isn't there but David's car is gone too. After he told David he wouldn't be using it. \n\nSo finally we get to the asshole part: this is a LOT of digging. On top of the above stuff, I've looked up criminal records, talked to all David's friends (they hate Kyle too FWIW,) asked a friend to use his Lexus Nexus access to look him up, and have done a lot lot lot of stuff behind his back to prove this guy is not who he says he is. We're very close to hiring a private investigator. I've trespassed on a lot of trust here. I feel like I've crossed a line. But I just want to be absolutely sure that if I ever confront David about him, Kyle can't talk his way out of it. But can I even confront him at this point without displaying this huge breach of trust I've done? Have I crossed a line into asshole territory or am I still just being protective? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We invited his mum, dad, brother, sister, surviving gparents &amp; 1 of his aunties. We however, didnt invite his other aunty (let's call her paula). Paula, since we met, has taken disdain for me, most likely because I have bright red hair, piercings &amp; tattoos, kinda alternative looking. Shes always made fun of how I look and speak (I'm 5 ft 2, thin and pretty shy), not to mention at every gathering, shes gotten crazy drunk and embarrassed herself.\n\nI said that if he wanted her there we could, but it was my husbands idea not to invite her, at the encouragement of his mum (Paula's sister). He also said he just didnt want the added stress of worrying shed say or do something dumb (she started a fight at his sisters wedding 2 years ago). She also likes to be vocal about her hatred of kids, and the majority of my cousins are under 10, and they are like my siblings- I love them to death.\n\nBasically the wedding happened, without her and it was an incredibly beautiful day. she found out through Facebook about it. She was LIVID, she sent abusive message after message to my poor husband saying how ungrateful he is for not inviting her, and then got his grandparents involved &amp; said that if they didnt cut contact with my husband and I, she would. So now his grandad refuses to speak to him and it's completely ruined him as he looks up to him.\n\nHis mum and dad are on our side though, but it begs the questions AITA for not inviting her and causing all this?",

            "input": "Context -So I had a uni friend (let's call her Ani) and we were friends from the very first year. We clicked and totally hit it off. She was very nice, very sweet (Italian) and she was always friendly. We would constantly go out to pubs (this is happening in London), restaurants and out as a group for coffee. We were happy and close.\n\nSo this story happens in our final year about a month ago from this posting. The final year is a big year because we have our dissertations to do. During the summer we were allocated a supervisor and chose topics. Ani got a notoriously lazy and slow replying supervisor from whom she couldn't get a reply from. So she messaged another lecturer (Jane, who taught both of us last year) and asked her of she knows if her supervisor was alive. Jane replied that Ani should just chill out and relax and stop disturbing the supervisor till after summer. Ani was annoyed a lot by this and told me this story. \n\nFast forwarding to December - I was in our uni library on the ground floor researching some stuff and I got a text from Ani. We messaged and turns out she was on the second floor. I told her I'd meet up in 10 minutes. This is where I thought of doing the prank. \n\nI yped in Google - disguise my email and came to a website that could send pretend emails to people as if from another person. So I sent an email as if from Jane (the teacher that pussed Ani off) to Ani with this text:\n\n'Dear Ani, I thought long and hard about out conversation last summer. I spoke with your supervisor and as a sorry here is a document with some research materials and links you might find useful.'\nAttached was a word doc\nIn the document was a meme saying - you've been pranked LOL.\n\nSo I sent that off and then as a test I sent the same email to myself instead of Ani using the same website. The email was sent to junk and was blocked with the labels saying it was dangerous and malicious and that you had to give specific permission to open it. So I thought to myself that there is no point of telling Ani about the prank (which I had the full intention of doing because I was meeting her in 10 minutes) since the email was so blocked she wouldn't open it. \n\nThis. Is. Where. I. Ducked. Up\n\nA week later I forgot about the incident. Ani didn't say anything either so I thought she never got it. Because if I got an email like that my first reaction would be to message the group chat and say - 'lmao which one of you shi* heads sent this?'. A week later I get an email from the head of department saying that she needs to interview me about 'impersonation of a teacher and harassment of a student'. My heart collapsed.\n\nI message Ani out of panic and tell her the truth and apologise. I take it all on the chin. She tells me she was deeply hurt and traumatised and how I have no respect for her. I told her that's not true. We've been friends for so long. She tells me that she told the ENTIRE department about this and she was having another meeting with other lecturers. I told her:\n\n-I'll take any punishment that comes to me even if it is suspension\n\nAni- suspension? You're going to get expelled.\n\nAt this point I was shaking. In England you pay for uni but you do get loans to help. I am not an British citizen. So I pay double without the loan that my parents pay and they struggle to. I work part time to help out too. To have all of that swept away in one go was terrifying. That night I seriously thought of ending i because of the shame I brought to myself and my parents. Then I decided to write a defence for myself and prepared for the interview. \n\nWhen I came to the interview the head of the department was very formal and just asked for my side. I was very apologetic, telling her that :\nI did not intend to be malicious\nI had the full intention of telling her if my test email sent through.\nI had no vendetta against her or Jane.\nAni and I were best friends.\nIf I thought that what I was doing was so wrong and I had the intention of doing it anonymously to I wouldn't have been stupid enough to do it on the uni system in the uni library.\n\n(I'll post the resolution email from the head to me at the end if you want to read)\n\nThe head looked at the email, briefly smiled when she saw the meme and told me to wait for the judgment. A week later I was told that the case was dismissed and everything was fine and just not to repeat this again. Also the head told me that Ani asked her to tell me never to contact her again or come near her. Prior to this she had blocked me on all social media.\n\nSo am I the asshole here? Or was the joke taken too far? \n\nTL;DR - made a prank email disguised from a lecturer to a friend with a meme inside. She took it personally and tried to get me expelled. \n\nThe resolution email from the head of department to me -\n\nDear Mark,\n\n\nThank you for coming to speak to me and H on Thursday and for giving us your account of the incident described in my last email. I’ve now had a chance to speak to the student who received the spoof email, and I’m writing to let you know that on behalf of the department, I have decided that no further action needs to be taken. This is because this is your first violation of King’s IT policy, and the incident does not appear to be part of a pattern of harassment of other King’s students or staff. I have let IT know the outcome of this investigation, and asked them to unblock your KCL account by the end of the day today.\n\n\nI include here a brief summary of our discussion, for the record and so that D is aware of the details. Please let me know if you would like to make any amendments to this account.\n\n\nWhen we met, you admitted immediately that you had sent the spoof email. You said that you and the student who received the email were friends, and that you sent the email as a joke from a library computer right before you were due to meet up with her, expecting that you would have a chance to explain the joke right away. You said that you had sent her other joke messages in the past, although not through King’s email. You said that you had not previously sent spoof emails, and that you found instructions for doing so online before sending this email. When you sent yourself a test email, you realized that the email you sent to her had been quarantined, so you assumed that she would not see it; it was only when you spoke to her later after she had released the email that you realized the seriousness of what you had done. You said that you knew about the student’s earlier correspondence with J about her dissertation because the student had told you about it herself at the time. \n\n\nIn our meeting, you expressed remorse for sending the email, and said that you understood the gravity of the offence and would not repeat it. You said that you are not currently experiencing difficulties that are interfering with your studies or your wellbeing, apart from the ongoing responsibility of caring for your younger siblings.\n\n\nAs we discussed at the meeting, any further violations of King’s policy (IT or otherwise) will be treated as a second offence, and may jeopardize your degree. This incident has been logged with the Student Conduct office in case this happens, although if there are no further violations, this incident will not appear on your King’s record. I would add from my conversation with the student who received the email that she has been distressed by this incident, and would like you to refrain from contacting her. I ask you to please respect her wishes.\n\n\nThank you again for your cooperation with this investigation. I wish you the best for the remainder of your degree, and I encourage you to speak to D as your personal tutor if you find that you are encountering any difficulties at any point.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nA)\n",

Basically, I've been doing porn on the side to make money. I'm currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. I'm a stay at home mom that can't get a job because of childcare expenses. We live in a pretty high standard of living area and are planning on moving soon. Until then, money's been tight. The child's father gives me child support but it's just enough to cover bills, nothing more. I've turned to making porn videos on pornhub. My boyfriend's upset with me because of it. I've told him time and time again that he can trust me. I've promised to stop after we get moved and I can get a stable income. However he's really upset by it. I'm his first real girlfriend and it bothers him that guys/girls will look at me like that. I don't think it's that big of a deal, I've tried talking to him about it but he refuses. He said he feels like shit for asking me to stop. I told him lastnight that I was going to stop when we move but I wasnt going to disable my account. That way, I can still make money off it, I just won't make new content. He got really upset. I'm torn here because I don't want to upset him but at the same time, I see no harm in doing what I'm doing. Am I the Asshole?",

I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA?

            "input": "Hey everyone. I’m in a bit of a conflict and could use outside opinions. \n\nTo begin, at the beginning of August, I moved in with 2 random college roommate in an off campus townhouse. I signed the lease with two other girls, we will call them H and S. \n\nS turned out to not be a very good roommate but this story is not about her. She moved in and hasn’t stayed a night over sense. She also abandoned a lizard that was on the brink of death when I found it in her room.  Anyway, S is out of the picture now and I thought everything would be fine in a spacious apartment with just one other roommate. \n\nH and I got along for months, even would call her a friend. She is a nice girl but she is a hypochondriac and allows her boyfriend to treat her like crap. She has caught him multiple times on tinder with other girls, going on double dates with his brother and other girls, calling her a bitch on her birthday, and that is just the beginning. I have been supportive of her every time she comes home crying because of him. \n\nOn top of the drama, H has 2 cats that completely ruin the place. She does not tend to the litter box as often as she should, but insists on keeping it in a closet in the kitchen. It stinks up the whole apartment. Not to mention both of the cats are males and have a dominance issue that leads to spraying. She has put off getting them fixed multiple times, and now it’s to the point that the apartment literally reeks of cat. H is also horrible at cleaning up after herself. She leaves rotting food in her room for weeks at a time and doesn’t understand you have to use hot water when cleaning dishes. They are left all caked in food and slippery with grease.\n\nSince S moved out a while ago, H and I have been looking for another roommate. My good friend and old roommate D just got back from a 6 month trip in France and wanted to move into the extra room. H and I happily obliged. \n\nToday, D texted me saying that she was uncomfortable living in the apartment because it reeks and gave her a headache after staying for just a day. I keep to myself in my closed off room when I am home, so I don’t really smell it too much. I brought up this situation with H, suggesting we move the litter box to her room since she has the largest bedroom (by far) and it would help solve some of the issues. \n\nH completely freaked out and said that she refuses to move the box to her room because she doesn’t want her room to smell like poop (even though if she cleaned it regularly, this wouldn’t be an issue) and that she doesn’t have room since her boyfriend is going to be moving into it with her. This was complete news to me. He expected to live here rent free, use my refrigerator, tv, everything but chip in a little for utilities.\n\nI finally snapped and told her D and I are moving out immediately and that her boyfriend can take over my lease. I told her that I am tired of living in a litter box with someone so unwilling to compromise, let alone respect. \n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend I’m the best roommate. I leave clutter around every once in a while, usually mail or school work for a day or 2. But I’m not dirty.\n\nI on one hand feel guilty for snapping and causing conflict right before classes start, but I don’t know if I can handle another semester with her. I also want to live with my friend I have missed for half a year, but I want it to be pleasant for everyone. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for snapping on my roommate and moving out suddenly?\n\nTL,DR; one of my roommates has cats that pee everywhere, who doesn’t clean and is gross. My new roommate got sick from the cats and wants to move out and I want to go with her. I snapped on my old roommate for being gross, selfish and unwilling to compromise.",

I told her how I felt I was being shut out, and how it reminded me of when I was bullied throughout school.  She told me that she was upset that I didn’t seem to care enough about her illness.  I made it clear that it was painful for me to see her getting close to Y and Z without me.  I had found out later that on previous occasions when they had met up that and suggested inviting me along,  X had said ‘she’s busy on that day’ or ‘she wouldn’t like that’.  Never was I even asked.  I also found out that X had lied about cancelling a night out with me under the pretence of having to work, but she went out with Z instead.  It was only when Z posted on Facebook that I found out.  X said work had been cancelled.  Later, Z told me (inadvertently) there had never been work – X just wanted to go out with Z instead.  I know that X has lied to others about such things because I’ve witnessed it.\nThings are going on as before.  X is still meeting up with my friends and family and never asked me, even though she has promised she would least sometimes.  It happened this weekend and it was just too much.  I now don’t want anything to do with her.  I’ll be polite when we cross paths but I have no interest in being a friend any longer. X has managed to convince everyone that she is the ‘victim’ here because she is ill and needs special treatment, and I’m the bad guy for not giving it to her.  Some people even tell me that I’m over-reacting because of my mental issues.  It’s painful and isolating.\n\n",

I don’t really mind this/brush it off since I won’t waste negative energy on someone who likely believes they’re just being nice.\n\nFast forward a few months; I’m a smoker and was outside the store and along the street for a cigarette break.

This makes \"friendships\" very interesting because people tend to remember me only when they need something.\n\nIn the last 3 years, I cut about a dozen people from my life. Out of them, 3 were actually very important to me; one of them was even my BFF. \n\nIt's the same story for all of them. Friend needs something so they call me for help. In most cases, it's something like babysitting their kids while they go out, or driving them somewhere when they need a ride. Many times though, I have also helped them moved, have cleaned their houses for them when they couldn't, and even allowed them to live with me when they couldn't live at home. \n\nAnd I'd run, every single time someone needed me, I'd be right there for them.\n\nMy \"awakening\" happened a few years ago when one day, my daughter simply asked me if my BFF and I weren't talking anymore. I wondered why she'd think that and she told me it was because my BFF never liked or commented on anything I posted on social media. I had never realized that up to that point, so I started paying closer attention. Sure enough, any of our friends posted something, she'd love it, comment it or whatever. Nothing whenever I posted something. She even ignored my comments on her own posts, while liking/commenting everything else others wrote. I asked her and she said I was being stupid, she was just busy. She would never call me to talk or get together, and whenever I'd call her, she'd say she was too busy (and then I'd see her out with other friends). \n\nThis went on for 2 years. The day I basically said \"FUCK YOU\" was after another friend made a group chat to invite us (about 5 friends in total, ex-bff included) to her b-day brunch. My husband had had an accident and was in the hospital (nothing serious, more for observation) and I posted that I couldn't make it cuz SO was in the hospital and I didn't know what time he'd be released.\n\nShe never asked what happened. She never asked if he was ok. She never called or messaged. When I got home, I deleted her (and all her friends) off all social media and never contacted her again. \n\nAITA for expecting more from her?",

            "input": "Not exactly sure what subreddit this goes in. But My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M) have been together for a year and a half now. She lives with her parents still and I share an apartment with 2 other guys. Her parents are extremely conservative and I think are just making her feel guilty anytime she is at the house with them. I don’t believe it’s directed at her but her mom has said before to her “don’t get pregnant it will change your life” and so she will feel guilty just because she and I aren’t conservative and are definitely liberal at our core. Basically because of her upbringing and her background she thinks that sex is super scary and that she will get pregnant immediately if I never wear a condom. So that’s fine I wrap it up. I spend the night occasionally at hers and she’ll sometimes come hangout at mine. Never spending the night of course because that’d be the end of the world for her parents.  She claims to enjoy sex and so once a month I’ll get to have sex with my girlfriend. Mind you I have to pull out while I wear a condom that is coated in spermicide. She’s an athlete like me though and extremely skinny so it’s not uncommon for their period cycles to be out of wack. Some months we have more sex others we have less. She’ll blow me here and there and give a handjob despite me telling her I don’t like them. But every month the week before she gets her period she’ll say that she’s late (23 day cycle is normal for her) and that she’s worried about being pregnant. How could she possibly be worried if we are only having sex once in a given month? and when we do have sex, I pull out with a condom on right before I finish or I won’t even finish via having vaginal sex at all because we don’t have it enough for me to be able to have sex with her at a pace that I can finish at... (basically got mad at me last time because she climaxed and I hadn’t yet and it was painful for her. Gee I wonder why) I try and tell her there’s no possible way she could be, she goes onto say that I’ll never understand because it’s not my body and that I’m not the one that could have a human growing inside of them....\n\nMore background, she and both of her siblings all went to catholic school and her sister(23) recently got married to her high school sweetheart. Another relationship that would shame her about sex and sex before marriage. They supposedly abstained up until marriage. That’s something she had used to say but said I had changed her mind about that. And also had told me that beginning of our relationship last year she’d be able to spend the night with me more as our relationship progressed. She even brought up that her sister is moving out next year and she may move in with them. \n\nWe definitely had a lot more sex last year but I’ve gotten a promotion and she didn’t so she’s trying to focus more. And she also had girlfriends’ houses last year she said she was spending the night at but has since distanced herself. So her parents are a lot more protective this year than last and it’s impacting our sex life. \nShe claims to enjoy sex and sometimes she’ll be the one to initiate it. Only when I’m not talking to her about it and basically when I forget about it completely. \n\nSo I guess what Im just going to start doing is trying not to even think about sex with my girlfriend at all and never be the one to initiate it. Because it winds up just blowing up in my face when I do. It’s not fair to me but I’m hoping to marry this girl eventually and hope that she’ll sexually blossom in the years to come. But right now she’s driving me insane with constantly worrying and it’s making me just want to distance myself from that aspect of our relationship. \n\nTL:DR girlfriend has vaginal sex with me once a month where I have to pull out with a condom on. Complains that she may be pregnant every month. ",

Despite this we realized we are completely right as friends. We still hang out regularly because we have similar hobbies and humor and have mutual friend groups. I have been dating my current boyfriend for four months now and it’s great. We’re nothing similar like me and my ex, but we connect on greater level where we aren’t fighting all the time like I was with my ex. It’s a much better relationship. Because my ex and I are so close, he and my bf have hung out a couple times with me and others. Both times it seemed fine and they actually got along well.\n\nHere’s the problem: In March a few of my friends are going to Maine to go hiking and see a friend couple who recently moved. My ex is among these friends going. I mentioned it to my bf and he wants to come and...I don’t want him to lol. First he doesn’t even know those friends and two, these are my friends. I want to be alone with them. He just came from some game convention thing with his friends that I didn’t even ask to go to (for one thing, idc about games) I know people need time with their friends. I told my bf I didn’t think that was a good idea and he said he didn’t see the problem since two people who are coming are in a relationship. However, they were already in the friend group and not a couple when I first met them and they’re the only couple besides the one in Maine. He got upset and said he only wanted to share an activity with me and feels bad that I’m more okay with spending time with my ex than I am with him and that I act very cliquey. However, I only spend time with my ex because we’re friends. If I hated everything about him, obviously I would not want to hang out with him.

I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n——————————————————————\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**",

            "input": "Okay so some background. My sister (16) and I (19) have recently started going swimming every weekend to try and improve our health. We both have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so we can’t go super fast and we have to take a lot of breaks, but we can swim at a perfectly decent speed which usually isn’t a problem.\n\nThe pool we swim at has three lanes: one lane has a parent and toddler class on a Saturday morning so it’s out of bounds. The second is an adults and children lane, and the third is adults only. My sister and I were swimming in the adults lane when a man came in who was swimming much faster than us. And he wouldn’t stop at all between laps. It quickly became impossible for my sister and I to swim in the lane, because every single time we started, he’d catch up to us and we’d hold him back. He made it very clear we were getting in the way, saying excuse me and knocking into me a few times (I think on purpose but I’m not sure). He also seemed to get annoyed by us taking breaks and standing at the end of the pool, even though we tried to keep out of the way. He also wouldn’t keep in line, he was kind of zigzagging across the lane trying to overtake everybody. It was a nightmare.\n\nEventually he got our attention and said to us: “Excuse me girls, this is the ADULT lane, and it can be quite fast. Maybe you’d be better suited to that lane” (points to the children’s lane). This pissed me off for two reasons. Firstly the other lane was completely full and nobody was following the rules about swimming clockwise, so it would be completely impossible for us to swim there. Secondly, I look a little young for my age but I’m clearly not a child, and the way he talked to me was very condescending. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just gave him a kind of grimace smile and continued swimming in the adult lane. We ended up getting out a few minutes later though, because it was so annoying. \n\nAITA for not moving? I’m genuinely not sure because as much as my sister and I are entitled to swim there, he is too and we were slowing him down quite a bit. But I don’t want to feel like I can’t swim in a shared pool just because of one person. I’ve been wanting to bring my blind friend swimming with me but now I’m worried that people will get annoyed with her too, and she can be quite easily upset if she thinks she’s inconveniencing people.",

For whatever reason fashion shows, award show red carpets and film/tv shoots keep happening in the area in front of her apartment building, and so I've accidentally cut through weird red carpets before trying to leave in a hurry (no one told me not too, and I was confused what was happening. But I didn't have time to figure out if there was a way to go around because I had somewhere to be.) ; so I charged through the chaos) and one film shoot, which the production assistant asked me to go a different way when trying to get to my friend's apartment, but there was no way around it to get in.\n\nExample 2: I  used to go to school in NYU, and they would always have film sets all over the Washington Square area, and production assistants blocking off spaces in the park or space by the West 4th station when they weren't even filming at the moment. So if I was running late for class (which I would be very late for if I took their proposed detour), I would just walk past the PA's with my headphones even though I knew they were trying to ask me to walk around the park.\n\nSeveral times, I've been yelled at by security guys. Ironically  always in situations where they are blocking the only exit or entrance, and when no one told me to go around the set or fashion show paparazzi area to begin with. But I usually respond with \"sorry, I'm late,\" and keep walking.

            "input": "I wrote this out once, but it ended up being super long so I tried to cut it down a bit. It didn't work too well. I (23m) am pissed at my girlfriend (24f) for going out and adopting a cat today, without even talking to me about it. We've been together for a little over a year, and have known each other for about a year and a half. She has a two year old daughter from a previous relationship, and they split custody almost 50/50. I had no intentions of having kids at this point in my life, but here I am trying to do my best. \n\nAnyway, my girlfriend recently moved out of her sister's house after her sister's dog bit her daughter. She moved into a small apartment on her own. I haven't moved in because my commute to work would be about an hour, and she's not even sure she's going to stay there when her lease is up near the end of this year. Also I'm just not sure I'm ready for that. She took two pay cuts last year, one because her job was making her miserable so she found something else. The other because the new place fired her and a bunch of other people after they got a remote staff. I gave her support and encouragement both times. Now she makes less than ever, and is trying to make it on her own. Her new job was super understanding of the move and everybody donated stuff to help her get on her feet, and they pooled together about $2000 to help her so she wouldn't have to get a second job. My problem is that she has no concept of financial responsibility. She's constantly spending money on useless things, without concern for how it will affect her bank account in the morning. For example, a $30 oil diffuser that she used for a week and then gave away because it wasn't helping her sleep like the internet said it would. She got one $30 lamp (that didn't even come with a shade), instead of the 3 $10 lamps that I suggested, but now complains that it's too dark. She has two gym memberships that she never uses, she just bought the new iPhone, even though her old one worked just fine, etc. We always go back and forth over what she should, and shouldn't buy, and she's already gone in the negatives, and needed someone to bail her out. I constantly try to help her with advice, and she always nods and then does the exact opposite, and it comes around to bite her in the butt. Or she'll call up her dad right in front of me, and ask him, and he'll say the same thing I did. I come from a family that is terrible with their money, and I've been helping to pay bills, (groceries, rent, medical bills, new appliances, renovations, taxes one year, brother's attorney most recently) since I was 10, while my stepdad was out buying a motorcycle, new guns, etc. So I know what it's like to be in a family with spending problems, eventually someone has to pay. But this means I also know how to handle my finances, and am usually never strapped for cash. Whereas, she's always had her dad (who generally agrees with me about her spending habits) to bail her out when things get hairy.\n\nSo this brings us to this cat. She said she gets bored and lonely on the rare weekend where she doesn't have her daughter, and I have things to get done at my house so I don't come to her. So she adopted an 8 year old cat. She got the cat for the two days every other month that she's alone, but it's going to be another responsibility every day for her. She complains that when she has her daughter she never has time to get things done, so instead of getting back into the gym those day, or getting a hobby, she got a living creature that she will now be responsible for. It has all of its shots, and its check ups are all up to date, I get it, she doesn't have to put much money into the cat right now, but eventually she will. Between cat food, litter, vet bills, damage to the furniture or apartment, eventually it will be a burden. She has a 2 year old who is already so much responsibility, I don't know why she thought a pet would make things better. The other problem is she knows that I'm allergic to cats. She knows they make my eyes, neck, and back of my throat itchy, they make my eyes water, and nose run. It's unpleasant for me to be around cats like that. They're cute to look at on the internet, but that's just where I prefer them to stay. She knows this. Yes, I can take allergy medicine but it's not 100% effective, plus that's more money that I have to spend, just to be mostly comfortable when I'm with her. I can honestly get past the allergy part, I'm bothered that I didn't factor in at all into her decision, sure, but the money thing is really what's concerning to me. Sure the cat could end up being perfect with no extra vet bills, but that would only encourage her to get more unnecessary things. Also this isn't the first animal she's adopted. She got a dog not long before she got pregnant while she was living with her ex in an apartment. Then she had to give it to her dad when she couldn't handle it while being pregnant. \n\nSo basically I'm hurt that she didn't even ask me about it. She said no matter what I said it wouldn't have stopped her. She's surprised I'm making such a big deal out of this, and that I'll just get over it. I didn't ask her to, but she said she won't apologize for doing it or even for not getting my opinion, and is acting like I'm a terrible person. Any major thing I do, I try to hear out her opinion on, because this is supposed to be a team effort, but she purposely didn't say anything to me because she knows I would have told her I didn't think it would be a good idea. Since I don't live there I don't get a say, even though she wants me to move in, but with her getting a cat I'm even less likely to do it. I get that we don't split bills and that she can spend her money however she wants, but I'm concerned that she won't change in the future when the bills are split, and I'll be in a family that struggles just like I've been in for the past 23 years. Or that she won't have the money when her daughter actually needs something, and I don't mean another giant toy that there's no room for. She has so many medical bills from herself and her daughter, and I know there will be more, no two year old in daycare stays healthy for long. I told her I wasn't okay with it, and that I'm very frustrated with this decision. I didn't give her an ultimatum or anything, and honestly I don't know what I even want to happen moving forward. I'm just at my wits end, and I wish she saved for unexpected expenses, and would listen to me for once. I've never taken more than about five minutes to move on after her poor decisions, but this time it's been all day, and I still haven't moved on. Am I the asshole for being so frustrated by this, or is she right and I should just get over it?",

He has a girlfriend now and he knows I still have feelings for him, but he keeps doing little things like send stuff over to my house or say good things about me when I'm not around and even asks people stuff about me. It really does make me happy, but I know it's not healthy and I want to completely change my life, hence the school change. But he is putting his relationship in the pits and I understand why he could feel like I've been leading him on since everyone knows I never stopped loving him. In fact, it is so hard for me to not fall into his arms right now, but I want to grow and start afresh. His current girlfriend has stopped talking to him and I think they're on the verge of a break up and I can't help but think it's because he thought he could be with me.

Sharing experiences and thought process helps me feel less of a weirdo and that there are people like me.\n\nSecondly, I enjoy helping other people through their problems. I get quite a bit of satisfaction out of seeing somebody's life take a turn for the better and knowing I helped with that improvement. So I like hearing peoples problems and giving advice and sometimes going out of my way and sacrificing my mental health and well being to help them improve their mental states, education, relationships, etc.\n\nI told a friend about this attraction once. And to say she was offended is an understatement.\n\nI got a very long, scathing speech about how I'm taking advantage of those with mental issues, how I'm a terrible person and a villain with a hero complex. \n\nI made the mistake of trying to explain myself, and got blocked.\n\nI was hurt, because she was a really good friend, but I also felt ashamed of myself for having this attraction.\n\nAITA?

Whenever somebody close in the family falls I'll or something bad happens, Im always the last person to find out, and it's always from somebody else. When I was at university, she failed to tell me for months that my nan had been diagnosed with cancer. This was the first time (to my knowledge) she'd done this, and where my issue with it all started. She said it was so that I wouldn't get stressed during my exams, which I can understand, but I explained to her that it was my nan and I had a right to know, and for future reference could she please tell me as I didn't want her to bare the burden alone. We're all family. She agreed. Fast forward a year and my nans cancer has taken a turn for the worst I get that this is her mother and she had her own coping system, but the only reason I found out was because my step brother told me. I chose to not say anything about her breaking her promise and consoled her as much as I could.\n\nThere have been other little things here and there after this, like my stepdad having a stroke and my brother's telling me, but I'm going to fast forward past this to last year. I was walking in the street of my old hometown and bumped into an old friend of the family and got chatting. After all the formalities, I was asked how my mom was doing now and if she was feeling better. Absolutely dumbfounded I asked what he meant, it turned out  that she'd had troubles with her womb and needed to have a hysterectomy, but they couldn't operate on her because she'd also had some issues with circulation in her legs and had a bad blood clot and some other issues (my memory of the whole ordeal is hazy and everytime I asked mom about this she'd always tell me it was nothing and not to worry). So after I confronted mom about not telling me this, I got the usual didn't want to worry me, and it wasn't that big a deal etc etc. I did lose my shit a little bit with this one, because as her only child I should be made aware of these things and how would she like it if I withheld information like that from her. \n\nShe then apologised and again told me that she would let me know for future reference. In her defence, she did keep me up to date with what was going on with her for a while, and gave me dates when she had her hysterectomy surgery so I was there for her and gave all the support I could. However, after the surgery she failed to tell me the one thing I worried would happen, that during the surgery her bladder got perverated and caused her to be incontinent. She tried to keep this from me for weeks until my stepdad told me. I again tried to have a stern but fair conversation with her. She's not been able to work nearly a year now while she's been on the waiting list to have repairation surgery, but did keep me up to date with appointments again.\n\nFast forward to today and I've just received a call from my step brother telling me that she's had her surgery today but hasn't came out yet. He's at the hospital waiting for her. To give you insight. My step brother (her husband's son) lives in Amsterdam, we live in the UK. He knew and came all the way over here a few days earlier from Christmas so he could see her, and I find out because he tells me. \n\nI'm getting fed up with it now, I'm always the last to hear about anything and I want to be there for my family, and it hurts that I'm always kept in the dark about this stuff. I'm going to the hospital after work to see her but it's going to take all my willpower to not lose it. Reddit, AITA for being selfish about this?",

He was the one who offered the bet to me, which was surprising because he is known to be pretty bad at the game. I quickly accepted his offer and we began fighting. After a couple lost games I realized I was getting destroyed and a little tilted, so i did a big bet in an attempt to get my money back. I lost that one too, and at this point I owed about $160.  I decided that I wasn’t going to be able to beat him so I stopped betting against him and agreed to pay him the money that I owed him as soon as I had the money. A couple weeks later I wanted to get Black Ops 4 because my friends were all playing it and the same friend I bet against agreed to buy the game for me. The game cost about $35, putting me at about $195 in debt.  Fast forward to today, about a month later. My other friend who is known to be very good at brawlhalla told me that during the entirety of my bets, he was playing for the worse friend. He told me this because he didn’t realistically expect me to pay $195 so instead he should just settle for the $35 I ACTUALLY owed instead of the money that they tried to scam me from.  So I was a little bit pissed upon hearing that my friend tried scamming me out of $160 and I decided to test him. I pretended like I had the full $195 and was ready to pay him, and he said “okay yea ill take it”. At this point I realized he was fully willing to completely scam me out of $195 and I now feel like the $35 that I owe him aside from the scam bets should not be paid. Am I the asshole? ",

During the time we were together, me and my family would give her gifts. I would often get her clothes from the store I used to work at.\nAnyway, about a two ago, I ordered a hoodie from a Chinese girl on instagram, at 400$. The hoodie came about a month later. Once it got here, I realized that the size was actually in the asian size chart, instead of american, so it didn’t fit me right at all. I call the girl and she tells me she could change it for me, so I wait another month for the hoodie to arrive, and when it does, the girl has the audacity to tell me that she can’t change it, but rather lower the price of the original by 10$, because the one she first gave me didn’t have a tag anymore, even though it never had a tag in the first place! So I just say fuck it and buy the hoodie for a second time at 30$, it just so happened that the day I went to get it, my ex was waiting for me at my house, so we started talking and I let her know about the hoodie and she says she’ll take it off my hands. Since I didn’t feel like making her pay full price, I told her I would do 30$ to at least make up for having to buy it again. She posts a picture of it on instagram and my dad happened to see, he then casually tells me “hey, isn’t that the same hoodie you bought like two months ago?” and I then explained the situation. He then scolded me and told me I should have given it to her for free (even though I used to make 260$ a month, so 70$ for a hoodie is a lot of money for me) so I call her up and let her know she could keep it.\n\nNow it’s eating me up, I’m not sure if I should have just given it to her to begin with or if giving it to her for 30$ wasn’t such a big deal.

            "input": "This argument has been going on for years between me and my parents, but has quieted down a little bit in the recent years since I've started college. The argument is that I don't want to actively pursue a relationship with the majority of my siblings, and though I've stopped actively avoiding them, I don't want them in my life (with the exception of two of my older brothers). This had always upset my parents, who firmly believe that you don't have to like your family but you still have to love them. In the end I cave and argue to do whatever my parents ask of me, but I want that to change now that I have started college. Thankfully now I don't interact with my siblings much at all, except for one brother whom I'm really close with and goes to college with me.\n\nBefore however, my parents would have me share rooms with my siblings who had moved back in for a reason or another, and in any argument that would start between me and another siblings, I would be excepted to be mature about it and let the situation go, because I was the most responsible. More often than not I was told to bite my tongue around my other siblings and whenever I would avoid them my parents would guilt trip me into hanging out with them.\n\nSo, some background on why I hate my siblings so much, most at least. At least 4 of my siblings are current or recovering drug addicts, and I think a few still are in trouble with the law. One reason I personally don't want them near me is because I don't want to be associated with anything illegal. \n\nAnother reason is the way they treat me and my parents. Since I'm the youngest I don't have perfect memory of their childhoods or mine for that matter. But I remember a lot of stories that I've been told by my parents about my siblings. A lot of them used to steal from us, probably to buy drugs. Two of my siblings I especially want to avoid are my sister and one of my oldest brothers.\n\n(Some background: anger issues and disabilities practically run in my family, which makes arguments that much more worse. I am legally disabled and have been since 7 years old, and I have medications I take every day for my disabilities.) My only sister, several years ago when I was in elementary school, we believe had stolen my medication and sold it. My parents had because so upset and worried, that they installed a lock on the cabinet where the meds were, which I believe conveniently was dismantled about two weeks later. She, in my opinion, has always put drugs and her self before anyone else. Often did drugs or drank in front of my, behind my parents back. Would be in and out of prison constantly. Would call random people in the middle of the night while I was trying to sleep (we shared a room until she moved out at 18). And never respected anyone. She constantly starts drama with anyone, isn't below using violence to get her way and will readily complain about being poor and then buy like $50 manicures every week. Me and her were never really close, as she preferred her friends over me and would get mad at my parents when they would make her play with me. The only times she would \"play with me\" voluntarily (for the most part that I can remember) was when should would take me or my brother somewhere under the impression of going somewhere to play, when she really would be taking us to where should could meet friends, or boyfriends, and on one occasion drink and smoke in front of me, I was 7. At 11 it was common knowledge for me not to touch our laundry basket because I was afraid of breaking a liquor bottle that she occasionally hid in there. I remember at one point, I was maybe 9, me, my sister and my mom were in the car going somewhere and my sister was complaining about how clingy I was. My mom said smiling that my sister was the one who begged for a little sister and my sister responded in an upset tone \"well I regret it\". And I don't think I've ever felt that unloved and worthless before. Don't get me wrong I have loving parents and my siblings say they love me. But in that moment I think I finally realized I was never going to get the loving relationship with my sister that was like it was in the movies or the way my friends described their sister were like.\n\nIn another instance one of my older brothers, his wife and their baby was living with us for 2 years (I believe rent free or incredibly cheap, as my parents believed in helping family when they are down). Though we have no solid proof we believe they were addicts. Some reasons for our suspicions were random pills scattered in drawers or on tables (no bottle in sight), our codine cough syrup was weirdly empty after a few months of them living there (even though only two people used it and neither said it was anything less than half full. And it was a BIG bottle too), and they always worked jobs that would pay them in cash at the end of the night (even though they conveniently seemed to never half enough money for anything that they begged/made my parents buy for my nephew (their son)). They would occasionally make me baby sit my newphew with no thanks or pay. Sometimes they woild leave me with him, saying they would be back at 10 pm or soemthing but wouldnt be found til 2 am. Always made my dad or another one of my older brothers baby sit my nephew constantly, even when they were in the house themselves, they just wouldn't pay attention to him and my parents would have to step up to the plate. During the first year they were there Christmas had passed and everyone got gifts, I had gotten a new camera I was really exited about and a bag for it. But since I didn't need it I put it away in my closet, that a shared with my niece because we shared a room. Fast forward 4 months and I decide I know a perfect place I could take pictures of with my camera. I go looking for it and it's gone, only the travel bag is left. I was fuming and told my parents, we searched but never found it. My parents believe it was stolen and pawned my brother or his now ex wife, as they had done the same with an xbox they had rented in my mom's name. I remember vividly, no words of apologies, but my parents asking how I could be so careless leaving something expensive \"lying around\" when I know my siblings have stolen stuff before. I still feel guilty about not being more careful to this day because I know the camera costed at least $300 which we definitely could have used to keep on tract with bills.\n\nIn the end, though my siblings have grown up some and changed in the time since I've last seen them. But a lot of the stuff they've done still mess me up today. I went through depression in high school for 2 years and during that I tried to get closure with my sister for the way I felt she treated me. I'll admit I didn't go about it the right way, I ended up explaining that I had been writing about things she had done when I was little and that I was sharing them with a self help group. She got mad and stormed off. My mom come to me and told me to accept that my sister would never apologize, that it was so long ago no one knows if what I remember actually happened and to just let it go. My sister ended up coming back and I apologized and sorta argued to move forward a forget the past (though I don't think I can). And while I'd like to think that they have changed, both have kids, their own homes, but still start drama on facebook, sister still continues to do drugs, fight and \"divorce\" her husband. I don't think I'll really ever be able to trust them. And I know that they've had their own issues to overcome that could be the cause of drug abuse (one was raped when they were a toddler. And the other had lived with a drug addicted mother till puberty) I don't feel that the way the choose to cope with it was okay or a right thing to put others through.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to be near them? I don't have the heart to tell any one it's because I'm afraid of letting them in my life and just being used for profit or gain again. Or should I stay firm if my parents ask me make accommodations for them, and tell them no? I want a relationship with my siblings but I feel that they don't really care. It's past the point of where I don't actually believe it when they say they love me, no matter how much I genuinely want them to.",

Also I'm on the mobile app and apparently that fucks with formatting, so apologies if this post looks a little bit wonky. Sorry if this gets long but y'all are gonna need a bit of backstory for context and I have a real issue with rambling. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend at school when we were 14. We were best friends for a year before we began dating and then were together for about six years. I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over six months. I find it easier to tell a story with names so we'll call my ex Jessica. \n\nThe year that we were friends was great. We were both kind of \"emo kids\" and, being that we lived kind of in the middle of nowhere and there weren't any other emos at our school, we kinda naturally drifted towards each other. She was a kind, sweet girl at first - very bubbly, always smiling, always friendly to everybody. She could be a little hyperactive at times, but I'm incredibly laid back and  a bit shy so we kinda  balanced each other's energy perfectly. We'd hang out at each other's houses almost every night after school and play video games, or go walk around the local park if the weather was nicer. I awkwardly asked her out on Valentine's Day of 2012, thinking I was being dead romantic. Still one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nShe started to change pretty soon after we started dating. She'd always been semi-jealous when it came to me, even when we were just friends. Think, if anyone else called me their best friend she'd get on their arse like \"actually sweetie he's *MY* best friend but nice try :)\" or she'd sulk a little if I made plans with other friends and didn't invite her. I'd always found it endearing, I guess because I was never the one getting chewed out. Boy did that change when we started dating! If I so much as spoke to another girl to ask her for the homework for some class, Jessica would get angry with me and demand to know who she was and what we were talking about. I did confront her about it a couple months into the relationship and she cried and told me she was super scared of being cheated on because she'd seen her dad do it to her mum her whole life and said she was sorry. At the time I thought that was reasonable, said alright and tried to move past it. \n\nThe jealousy didn't stop. In fact, it only continued to escalate. When we were 16 she, without my knowing or my consent, went through my Facebook friends and Instagram followers and blocked any girls I wasn't related to. When we were 18 we started renting a flat together and she threatened one of our neighbours to \"keep the fuck away from me\" because she brought over cookies as a welcome gift while Jessica was out. That same year when I came out as bisexual, she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with my best friend since childhood because he was gay and she was afraid of any \"funny business\" going on. It reached a point where she wouldn't even let me go to the hairdresser's because the only one in our town had three women and a gay guy working there and she didn't want any of them touching me. She also repeatedly called my workplace saying I needed to come home because there was an emergency if she knew I was on a shift with all female co-workers (which was often) resulting in me eventually being sacked. \n\nHonestly, if it was just the intense jealousy, I might have been able to cope, or try to salvage some semblance of a relationship with her. But she would also insult me constantly. I'm pretty prone to eczema and she'd make fun of me if I had a breakout of it on my face. She mocked me when I lost my job and she became the breadwinner of the house. She'd either tease me or get incredibly angry with me if I ever cried about anything (I'm a sucker for crying at films). I gained a little weight around 19 when I had an injury and could no longer go to the gym and she called me fat relentlessly (in hindsight, I really wasn't fat at all), which I believe was one of the catalysts to me developing bulimia. All in all it was a shitty, emotionally abusive situation and I should've gotten out of it sooner than I did. \n\nI eventually broke it off because she started to become physically and sexually violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life one night. I'm now staying with my aforementioned childhood best friend and his husband, have a new job, am in recovery for my eating disorder and am well on the way to getting back on my feet. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole because of what happened in the relationship because I've come to accept that I was a victim and none of it was my fault. \n\nHowever. A \"friend of Jessica's\" recently reached out to me to let me know that Jess has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and is recieving treatment for it. My response was basically \"ah that sucks for her and I'm glad she's getting treatment but what's that to do with me?\"  What eventually transpired was that I was not speaking to her friend, but in fact Jessica herself through her friend's account, and that I was expected to forgive everything she did because of her diagnosis. I flat out refused because, while I'm no means an expert on personality disorders and do understand that they can make people act irrationally, I don't believe they're an excuse for outright abusive behaviours. Since I refused to forgive her, I've had countless messages from her, from mutual friends, and even from her mother which all essentially boil down to \"she can't help being an abusive person, you're being awful for not forgiving her.\" I'll note here she hasn't actually *apologised*, just incessantly asked me to \"forgive and forget\", \"get over it\" and even to give her a second chance. I'm starting to doubt that I'm doing the right thing by refusing to accept her BPD as an excuse. AITA and should I forgive her? \n\nTL;DR: my ex was incredibly abusive when we were together and has since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which she's using to try and justify her behaviours without actually apologising. I refuse to accept it as an excuse and she, her mother and our mutual friends are telling me I'm the asshole for not forgiving her. \n",

We drop them off in the city and ask if they have money for the bus/need to be dropped home and they assure us that they're fine.\n\nFast forward to the next day, i'm in work and i don't finish till late, after checking my phone i find myself blocked and kicked from every group chat and a slew of messages including every version of how im a terrible person from \"a toxic relationship towards women\" to \"sucking the fun out of everything\". \nApparently Jane accused me and the driver of abandoning them without the money to get home and people with a grudge against me for whatever reason took this opportunity to see what kind of bull they could get away with sticking on my image.\n\nAll this ended up blowing over and i just stayed out of it, not the type for drama but two weeks ago, one of the friends i knew for years comes into me in work (first time i've seen him since the fallout) and confronts me about supposedly stalking Marsha, with \"texts to prove it\".\n\nThis was the last straw and after that i've started the process of a defamation of character case. \nI don't know if i'm just being petty but after this i don't want to imagine what sort of things people are believing if its been this long and people would believe that about me.\n\nTL:DR- People are spreading bull and evidence isn't convincing enough, so forcing them to court just to avoid the possible collateral damage a suspected charge might have on my life.",

Things went smoothly for the first year and then things started to go downhill.\n\nThis girl had some pretty bad social and mental issues (social anxiety, depression of some degree, and even lived in a not so supporting household). This led to her being a girl who kept to herself mostly, even from her boyfriend. It would be a journey just to find her in the morning, as she didn’t have a phone.\n\nThen her problems got worse, to the point of her cutting herself. This is when she completely separated herself from everyone, including me. She would barely talk to me and seeing her so broken and hurt made me as a boyfriend feel useless and pathetic. \n\nI felt horrible that I couldn’t help her. She was very much in a bad place and there was nothing I could do.  I wanted her to be able to find someone who could help her with her issues.\n\nWith us being so separated, I started losing the feelings for her I used to have and started getting feelings for another girl who shared feelings back. It was a feeling I missed. \n\nAfter a month of this, I told my current girlfriend that I wanted to end our relationship and told her that I was losing feelings and that I felt that she needed to find someone who could actually help her with her problems. This went over like a car on bricks.\n\nImmediately, word went round that I left her for another girl and that I broke up with her because of her mental issues. People HATED me. They didn’t know my side of the story and didn’t bother to find out. The took the word of the innocent, shy girl.\n\nThree months later and that girl is more social than she ever was. She’s actually talking to people in our school. So i don’t know if I was holding her back or if she just randomly became social. \n\nSo the question is Am I The Asshole that everyone thinks I still am?",

I tell him I treat everyone the same way, I always take the money first, that's just the rules.\n\nImportant detail: this guy isn't white. He is clearly hurt by a perceived lack of trust and I think he thinks it's a racism thing. Also I did tell him it was store policy but I was lying. It was just my policy.\n\nHe did go and get the money by the way. I didn't think he was trying to pull anything. It was just a rule I enforced for everyone. Never in my pizza delivery career did I ever provide pizza before receiving payment. In fact it was rare that I ever had to ask for the money. Most of my customers knew the drill without me needing to say anything.\n\nI think another driver might've given this guy the benefit of the doubt.

I get along great with his parents, but his older brother literally hasn't said more than 10 words to me in our 4 years knowing each other. At first I would greet him and ask how he is, and I would get no response. He would walk past me in the kitchen, finish what he was doing and go on his way. \n\nSo last year I spend Christmas with my boyfriend and his family for the first time. I showed up with gifts for everyone, including the brother (a PlayStation gift card), but was too nervous to give it to him directly because I thought he hated me or something so I gave it to my boyfriend to give to him when I left. I never got a thank you. \n\nSo fast forward this year, I was again invited to Christmas with my boyfriend and I want to accept, but the first thing that came to my mind was \"What am I going to get the brother?\". I asked my boyfriend and he didn't really know. He said I could get him another gift card, or I could just get him nothing because he won't get me anything and he probably won't say thanks either. \n\nI immediately refused and said I couldn't show up with gifts for everyone but him, but then I thought about the facts that I talk to everyone but him, and if I can't face him long enough to give him his gift, should I be getting him one in the first place? Also, to be fair to him, he's seems very socially inept. He rarely leaves the house, and I've heard that he treats mostly everyone except his family the way he treats me, but it's never been confirmed. \n\nSo I leave it to you redditors, would I be the asshole if I showed up with no gift for the brother who ignores me?",

Hopefully I can give a clearer picture.\n\n\nBackground: My husband and I are recently new homeowners in a state that is getting dumped with snow. Much to my husbands dismay, we don't have enough saved for the snowblower he wants, so we're stuck with shoveling it ourselves (sidenote: in case it gets brought up, no I will not pay for snow-removal service when both of us are strong, able-bodied adults who have the time). I work nights, 10 hour shifts, and he works days, 8 hour shifts. Both of our jobs are physically demanding. So far we've been good about doing our fair share of winter maintenance. \n\n\nSituation: I am working 12 hour shifts most of the week due to a surge in production (yay overtime pay). Due to incoming weather, his job notified employees yesterday afternoon that today they would start an hour late. The snow started falling at 11pm and hasn't stopped. I got off after 830 am this morning ready to take a shower and do some shoveling, if needed. Turns out it was very much needed as my husband didn't shovel any of the driveway (1 car length by 3 car widths of pavement), the back sidewalk (idk, 25? feet) or the front steps and sidewalk ( about 30? feet total). It's been snowing for 9ish hours so it's not a small amount, it's several inches deep. \n\n\nI shovel the driveway and the back sidewalk. I start the front sidewalk but I stop because I'm upset and think it's unfair. So I text him, stating clearly why I'm kinda pissed and that the front sidewalk will be waiting for him to shovel when he gets home. I also say that \"I don't love him any less, that I'm just upset.\" I don't want him thinking I hate him, I'm just upset at the situation. No response yet but I dont expect one until he goes to lunch. I suspect he used the extra hour this morning to sleep in, which he has every right to do. However maybe a text about how he didn't get to the shoveling would have been appreciated, that way I wouldn't have been blindsided. \n\n\nI've been going back and forth over if I should feel this way. Half of me is saying \"Suck it up, Buttercup, that's life,\" while the other half says I need to make my feelings known so I don't push it down and allow it to fester and manifest in some other way. So, fair Reddit, AITA for assuming my husband would do some shoveling before he went to work and not leave me with it all?\n\n\nP.S. I may not comment until some hours from now, as I need to get some sleep before my shift tonight. ",

One of the girls I met was 35 and wanted to come over to my place at night after a very minimal amount of chatting. I figured it was a classic bootycall. She came over, we had a good time, had drinks, and as expected she stayed the night. And that's where my fuck-up happend: I don't want to blame the excessive amount of alcohol (I'm pretty good at handeling my drink, but drank over 6 beers before she even came over, drank a lot more with her) but for some reason I was a fucking idiot and didn't use protection. \n\nThe next morning I realized this was a major fuck-up and went out to get us breakfast and got her a morning-after pill. She took it, we had breakfast, she told me she didn't have any STD's (which I wasn't so sure about given how easily she slept with me) and she left. (It later turned out she didn't give me any STD's btw).\n\nI ended up seeing her 4 more times in the next two weeks (I made sure to use condoms every time) - we always met at night, and I was very clear about not wanting a relationship - she said she didn't either. After those two weeks I kind of got my life together a bit more and wanted to quit casual hookups to go after this other girl that I was really in love with. So I broke up with her - and she took it HARD. Talked about wanting to commit suicide and stuff. I recommend her some people/telephone numbers/anonymous chat organisations that could help her and broke off contact. \n\nOver the next two months she occassionally (drunk) texted me to tell me she wanted to date again. I kept saying I was over it, that I had moved on and that I didn't want any contact anymore.\n\nFast forward another month: she texts me pictures of an ultrasound, telling me she had become pregnant by me and had a miscarriage. I'm not sure if the pictures are legit - but there's a date on them that fits the timeline. I realise the morning-after pill doesn't have a 100% success-rate but she did get her period about 1,5week after the unprotected sex. Always used condoms after that first time. \n\nNow she keeps blaming me for everything. I figured I'd go with believing her story, had a convo via texts about how I'm really sorry this happend, that it was never my intention and that I should've used a condom that first time. However, she keeps saying I'm a horrible person for breaking it off with her, how it's unfair that I continue with life while she's had to deal with this, that she's mad and believes I treated her like a toy, and so on.\n\nI obviously feel bad about the whole thing and would like to hear your opinions. \n\nPS: I know I really fucked up having  unprotected sex with someone I just met an hour ago, after months I'm still mad at myself about it, but is there anything I could've done better after that fact?

Spent my christmas money and money I got for doing good in school somewhere near the end of the year and I recieved very little pocket money. I had about 40 euros before that. On January 30th, 2016 I bought a lego dimensions expansion box, 30 euros. This is a videogame with actual lego and I wanted it for some time. I had only 11 euros by valentine’s day. About a week before then she asked whether we should do something on valentine’s day. It would have been on a sunday. I said that we could just hang out, but she insisted we’d do something. It was the last week for star wars: the force awakens. We both had seen it and I said I’d rather spend the day at her home or at mine, but she really wanted to go. The price for movie tickets were 11.50 a piece and thats excluding popcorn etc. I said I didn’t have too much money so asked whether we could split the price 50/50, as I would recieve my pocket money before that. No no no, I should pay for it, she said, because that’s romantic. Well, I don’t have my money, but I’m sure my parents could buy it! That’s not romantic either. Fine, I’ll pay she said. In addition, we also could buy a rose at school, but we said to each other that we wouldn’t do it and I was planning to get one before we went to the movie theatre. That friday she texted me that she was very mad at me for not getting more money and spending it two weeks earlier, when we didn’t have any plans for it yet. I responded saying this, she ignored that. Later that day, I got a rose. The last class of the day I sat in front of two girls who I regularly have a chit-chat with and explained the situation, which might’ve made my girlfriend mad because she probably overheard me. The next day I was playing a sportsgame at 8 in the morning so I left and didn’t check my phone. We got home and we left to go to an amusement park and were away the entire day. I had left my phone at home. We ate on our way home and got home at 9. Me being younger meant that I fell asleep immediately, again not checking my phone. The next day I had a lot of texts from the school group chat for homework so my girlfriend’s text was at the bottom. I didn’t read it and found out about it in the evening. We chatted for a while and she ended it with a ‘see you tomorrow’. We met up and she broke up with me. I know this is long, but thanks for reading anyway. ",

I share a bathroom with the girl in the room next to mine.\n\nI haven’t really spoken much to her aside from a couple of “Hello’s” here and there and the occasional “How was your day.” Barely even acquaintances honestly. Throughout the semester I’ve kinda taken charge on keeping our bathroom clean—I’m kind of a clean freak so I took it upon myself to wipe down our tub and shower curtain every now and then.\n\nShe, however, does not seem to be on the same page. She’s prone to leaving hair in the bathtub, and has never bothered to try and straighten up the bathroom on her own accord. She has the cleaning supplies for it, but I’ve never seen them used.

Nothing was ever done about it on her end, so I finally snapped today and wiped everything down again.\n\nWhen I tried to scrub the grime in the bath tub with my Clorox wipes, I realized it was going to be a hassle. But, my roommate had a scrubbing brush and a bottle of Fabuloso sitting on the toilet. I figured since she had never used it, and it was going toward our communal bathroom, I made the call that it wouldn’t be a big deal if I used the stuff to clean our place of bathing. 20 minutes later, everything was relatively spic-and-span.\n\nNow that I’m thinking about it though, I feel like I overstepped a boundary somehow. As I mentioned before, we’re barely acquaintances, and even though I used her stuff to clean a space we both use...I still used her stuff, y’know? We move out in two weeks and being that she never bothered to scrub the bathroom before, I figured she wasn’t going to start now. But now I’m afraid she’ll get angry if she realizes her stuff was used. She already moved her little trashcan out of the bathroom and next to her sink, I assume because she no longer wanted me using it. So I’m not sure here, AITA? ",

I don't want to do this, you're making me\" (I have since gotten into therapy and do accept it was not, in fact, my fault) and B: because one time I tried to use a pocket knife to stop him from hurting my sister.  It didn't work and he just beat me up, telling me the horrible things he would do if I ever tried to stop him again or if I told anyone what he had been doing.  I still have a physical scar from it.  \n\nSo when I got stuck in therapy to see if he had done anything to me, I still thought it was my fault and I was still afraid of him.  By the time I could trust the therapist, she transferred me to another therapist and I felt I couldn't trust anyone.  That therapist told my mom \"The grandfather wasn't interested in boys, so your son is fine.\"\n\nJust my sister went to the police.  They interviewed her and gave my grandfather a polygraph test.  He passed the test (Something psychopaths can do very easily.  Fun, err, disturbing little trivia fact.) and the police declined to bring charges against him.  My mom tried to tell the rest of the extended family and they all turned against us saying she was spreading lies.  In 1992 we cut ties and moved three states away.  We couldn't do anything about him and we just had to move on with our lives.  I remember at one point looking at the laws and seeing that the statute of limitations had passed on what he did to me.  Not that I had any faith in our justice system to prosecute him, honestly.  \n\nI tried to heal and move on (Some days are better than others).\n\nThen I saw that post and read some commentators that said there is no statute of limitations for that type of crime in Colorado anymore.  That means I could report him.  \n\nI thought a lot about it, and I just don't want to.  I've talked about my history on reddit before, and had someone message me saying I was a \"little (derogatory word)\" for not taking the law into my own hand and going to beat the shit out of him.  I had lunch with a friend and he told me that I'm a bad person for not going back to Colorado to take care of this because he might hurt other kids.  My grandfather is now 90 years old.  Has he hurt other kids?  Maybe.  I try not to think about it.  I'd like to think he's now too old to do that anymore.  \n\nMoreover, I don't want to take revenge on him.  I don't want to send a senile, 90 year old man to die in prison.  Even if he is a heartless monster.  I don't know if I strong enough to travel back to Colorado for whatever that would involve (I still live three states away).  I don't want to deal with the inevitable nightmares of going back to confront him.  I called him on the phone once, and it didn't go very well (See my post history, if you're curious).  \n\nI just want to go on with my life, forget that bastard and just heal.  Does that make me an asshole?  \"Evil prevails when good men do nothing\" as the saying goes, but I don't know if I can do anything and I don't want to deal with the guilt of sending him to die in prison.  I know he'd be going because of his crimes, but I struggle with guilt and anxiety.  I know that it would eat me alive to know I was the catalyst that sent him to prison.  \n\n\ntl/dr; my grandfather used to rape/molest me 30 years ago in Colorado.  I just discovered that the laws were changed to remove the statute of limitations on child sex abuse crimes.  I don't live anywhere near him and I want to get on with my life and healing, not going back to Colorado to try and bring him to justice.  ",

            "input": "This is going to be kind of long: I almost killed myself last March, and I attribute it 80% to my parents. \n\nStrike 1: My parents were an absolute disaster during my high school years, and any time they suspect that I feel this way, they go on about how there's no rule book and they were doing the best they could. They did have a reason for being disasters: my baby sister died at 3 months old due to complications from surgery. My dad became extremely controlling (he had to know where my sister and I were at all times, who we hung out with, even where we picked up new words/phrases), and my mom became extremely depressed. She wouldn't acknowledge that there was an issue, though, so I went through high school with a narcissistic and controlling father and a generally absent mother. This all shaped the rest of the issues I have, some of which are detailed below. \n\nStrike 2: I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high school, so my parents affected and controlled literally every part of my life. I was told what exactly to believe, commanded not to question it, and fed a bunch of bs that anyone who believed differently than my parents was evil and going to hell. My entire freshman year of college I honestly believed that being gay was one of the worst things that anyone could ever be. I met my best friend that year, a very awesome, very gay person. I later discovered that I am bisexual. I haven't told my parents, since they always go on about how their friends with gay kids are so strong to put up with the \"choices\" their children made.\n\nStrike 3: I grew up in an extremely conservative Christian home that gave little credibility to mental illness. I'd really like to think that when I started showing signs of depression at 15 a serious conversation about mental health and an appointment with a psychiatrist would have not lead me to almost kill myself at 19. My parents did give me options: I could go see a Christian counselor who would tell me to pray more and give my worries to God, like what my parents had already told me, or I could talk to the family doctor. I was sort of fed up with religion at that point, so I talked with the family doctor. She said it sounded like I was depressed and gave me a bottle of pills. She told me to come back if they weren't working. Looking back, this was absolutely not an appropriate response to what I was dealing with, and it took me years to figure out I wasn't supposed to feel down all the time.\n\nI've talked to many trusted people about this situation, including the fact that the only way I see ever being at peace is to never have to deal with the people who screwed me up this badly again. Initially, I wanted to completely disown them, and after talking it out more and thinking on it, my counselor even agreed it would be a good thing for me if it's what I still want. I know family is supposed to be forever and all that, but I haven't felt love for them since I was a very little kid, and it stresses me out enough to be around them that it can trigger a depressive episode and make me question my safety. I even ended up changing majors so I had to take summer classes just so I didn't have to be around my family all summer. I get depressed even thinking about going back for the holidays. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I sat them down, expressed my grievances, and told them I never wanted to see or hear from them again, for my own happiness and health? \n",

A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. ",

One ended up leaving a year later, and the other was let go. Since I work part-time with varying schedules, I never really needed to talk to the supervisor for tasks. I come in and ask my co-workers what's going on and what tasks must be completed.\n\n  \nWell since they are both gone, I wasn't properly trained and pretty much figured out how to do the job as I go day-by-day, considering I only work a handful of hours a week/day. I approached the supervisor once with a question and he said he'll teach me how to solve the issue once he's done with something. He never did. And this was like several months ago. Apparently, there's more work that needs to be done as my job description but he NEVER comes up to me or bothers training me. \n\nI figured he doesn't hate me or my job performance because if he did, I would have been fired. When I run into him in the hallway, he's polite and respectful. However, he's not really vocal about what things must be done, nor has he hired anyone else to help me within my department. It's not a difficult job, despite me picking up a few more responsibilities but considering I work less than 15 hours a week at most, I do believe someone should be there who can commit to more hours to be able to handle customer inquiries, etc. in a timely manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI basically feel like I'm doing whatever I want at my job at my own pace without supervision.

I'm very emotional right now and it's definitely affecting how I'm thinking right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: \n\nI got in a relationship with a girl I met online a little under a year ago. It's been pretty complicated. We never actually met, but that didn't stop me from becoming very attached to her. I had some trust issues and early on and ended up doing some snooping on her, I talked to her about it and we got in a fight and broke up but ended up getting back together later, it was rocky for a while but eventually we learned to get along and ended up making it work for a while. She's sick and has been for a long time. She ended up having to move in with her parents several months ago and our contact was strained during that time. We only talked a couple of times a week, she progressively got sicker and sicker over time but I stuck by her. Anything she needed I was there. I helped support her emotionally and financially. I really felt like I loved this girl. Eventually she even told me that once she got better she wanted us to live together, that she loves me more than I can possibly know for sticking by her side through the time she's been sick and waiting for her. My point here is that I felt very close to her and she felt very close to me. I've never felt so strongly about someone before. (I still believe everything she told me about her condition and I also have even spoken to her mother and her sister about it, I also believe that she did have feelings for me and even loved me). Onto the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeither of us use social media very much, so I never cared before, but recently I had suggested that we be friends on Facebook so I could send her messages from my work computer, she agreed initially but then backed down saying that her family was uncomfortable with it since her last boyfriend had harassed her and her family after they broke up. So she told me that she was going to hold off on it and I said that I understood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, this dealt a huge blow to my trust, I felt like she was trying to hide something from me. I'm not going to go into huge amounts of details, but ended up finding her LoL account info and looked up her match history. I found games dating months back, she was queuing with her friends nearly every day. Days that she said she was too sick to talk, days she said she was even in the hospital. This led me to believe that she was on alternate profiles, or marking herself offline on discord and the like, so she could sneak around behind my back and do stuff with her friends, and not have to do stuff with me. (She did this before when we were fighting, but I didn't think she'd do it when we were getting along fine).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called her today and confronted her on this. I did my best to maintain a level head, and gave her the opportunity to be honest with me first, and I told her that if she was honest with me that I was completely willing to forget about it. She flipped out at me and said that it wasn't her that she was letting a friend use her account. She told me I was a psycho for doing this again and that she was done and never to contact her again or she would \"fuck my life up\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's why I feel even worse about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a conversation just a few days ago about us and we both reaffirmed to each other that we wanted to be together and that we loved eachother. She promised to be more proactive in contacting me and such. She followed through on this and for the past few days she was indeed talking to me more. Just this morning she called me just to wish me a good morning, and to tell me she loved me. That's when I brought up what I found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for snooping on her? Was it wrong of me to go seeking out her history? I feel like I shouldn't have ever brought it up, I feel awful like I've thrown away a year of hard work for nothing...",

            "input": "Before I get on with the story I want to point out that I have BPD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. This makes my emotions switch on a dime and causes me to see through something called \"black and white\" vision (basically I can go from hating someone to adoring them for no apparent reason).\n\nSo I've never really dated anyone mostly because I'm a flaming homosexual and the only people attracted to me are guys. A few months ago one of my friends openly stated she had a crush on me. This kind of shocked me because I had a but of a crush on her as well, but she had a boyfriend. \n\nWe had talked a bit and a few days later I told her that I get really anxious and a relationship wouldnt be good for either of us mentally. (She has depression aswell) Besides, I didnt want her to cheat on her boyfriend. \n\nShe said that she understood and I thought we would go back to being friends. I was wrong. Whenever I'd go get lunch and sit with a few of my friends she would get really affectionate with me; aka hold my hand, hug me, etc. This would be fine but 1: we weren't dating and 2: touching me made me really uncomfortable.\n\nI didn't say anything but I didnt really share the affections. That night she texted me, asking if I was mad at her. I had explained that I wasnt mad but just got really anxious when people touch me. I also went on a long tangent about how we shouldn't date because my BPD makes it extremly difficult for both people in the relationship. She seemed understanding so I thought that was it.\n\nA few days after I was in a very bad place mentally and it showed. She talked with me and made me feel a lot better, which in turn led me to get clingy that day. I wanted to hold her and hug her, even if that was very odd for me. I needed someone to hug that day, and she was that person. I guess she assumed that was the normal and for the next few weeks tried holding and kissing me. I was visibly anxious once again and told her that it made me uncomfortable. \n\nShe took this as anger and ended up avoiding me for the next week because she thought I was mad at her. This was not true and I had confronted her about it. After this things went back to normal, and by normal it meant she was clingy and close to me again. \n\nNow I knew she had her own problems and I really didn't want to cause things to go worse for her. This meant I let her hold me close no matter how uncomfortable it made me. I wanted to help her and by avoiding her efforts it obviously affected her negativly.\n\nThis went on for a while and I kind of let it happen. It took its toll on me, getting me into a worse state by the day. The only time I drew the line was when she invited me to her house for a dinner the very day. I got anxious at the thought and frantically made any excuse I could. She told me how important it was to her and I told that I couldn't. This led to a mini fight and she ghosted me for a week. Again she thought I was mad at her and had again explained that situations made me very anxious and could send me into a very bad panic attack.\n\nAgain things back to normal. Up until I had snapped. I got upset and told her to please stop touching me and to stop getting upset after I dont answer her constant calls or texted. I got mad because she wouldnt listen to me and we technically broke up. She was really hurt by that, and avoided me. I had come back to re-breakup, but being much more polite about it. I told her that it just wouldn't work, and continuing a relationship would only hurt us both. I apologized for earlier but said I still didnt want a relationship.\n\nAm I an asshole for breaking it off with her?\n\nTLDR: My mental illnesses make relationships very hard. Girl tries to date me anyway even though I am openly uncomfortable. After not listening to my requests I decide to break up with her. ",

One time I went in there and they had completely taken over the middle of the glowing dance floor thing.

The only other one probably worth mentioning is that she shit talks her one friend who doesn’t work and lives with her boyfriend supporting her.   She’s said that she would never allow herself to live like that.  Relying on a partner for everything.  Literally besides our first date, she’s never even offered to go 50/50.  \n\nThis all probably sounds harsh.  She’s a lot more than these examples and I get excited every time I’m about to see her.   The hypocrisy has been rubbing me the wrong way for a while though and it’s not something I’ve been able to push out of my head or just ignore.  Like I said at the top, she calls out bullshit where ever she sees it.  I want to take a page out her book. ",

Per our custody arrangement we have 50/50 split custody (one week on, one week off) of our two girls aged 5 and 7. We are currently living together and co-parenting until my ex-wife can afford to move out.\n\nMy ex-wife has a friend, let's call her Mary, who has cancer and lives close to my ex-wife's work and with whom she stays most nights when it's my week to watch the girls. Not too long ago I found out that she had lied to me about staying with Mary when she was really spending the night with the affair partner. It is currently her week to watch the kids and tonight she asked me if I was okay with taking care of the girls overnight so she could stay with Mary. I told her that if she was actually staying with Mary I was fine with it. She asked me what I meant and I told her that I was not okay with doing a favor for her that directly benefited the guy she had cheated on me with and who I obviously hate. She stated that it shouldn't matter who she was staying with if I'm okay with watching them for her to stay with Mary then I should be fine with watching them for whatever reason and that I was being controlling. I think there's a big difference and told her that putting conditions on a favor is not controlling since the other option is just a straight no.  \n\nI've been pretty messed up by everything that's gone down and don't have a ton of people who I can ask for advice, so reddit, AITA?",

            "input": "It's me again :&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work at Starbucks, and have been working here for the past year now. I really do enjoy my job and I'm always happy when I get to work. I get along well with my co-workers, and many of our regular customers. Before I continue, I've worked in customer service for a few years now outside of SB and I am well aware that people are not always going to be pleasant. I'm usually well at diffusing situations and staying calm under pressure, which is part of the reason I'm pretty decent at my job. However, there's one customer who's a regular that I've been having issues with these past few months, and today was my breaking point and the worst interaction I've had with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe always has the same order - tall, extra dry cappuccino with whole milk. I'm also convinced that he doesn't really know what a cappuccino is. No matter who is making his order, he always sends it back and says that something is wrong - the milk isn't foamy enough, it feels too heavy or too light, the espresso doesn't taste correct, there's not enough of something or it's too hot or too cold... literally any and every excuse in the book has been made, and every single time he makes someone remake his drink. Now, he's older than I am by a good amount of years - I never want to disrespect someone older than I or stick my nose up at difficult customers, so I usually just stay calm and ignore it. I'm used to it and let things like that go. Starbucks is overpriced and inexpensive, I totally get it. But he comes in at least 5 to 6 times a week, so how can it possibly be made incorrectly every time, when we make cappuccinos at least 30 times a day?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Side note: He has caused problems with my co-workers before as well. One of my co-workers in particular simply refuses to serve him. She sees him come in, and has to go in the back and wait until he leaves. This is because he blew up at her and asked her why she couldn't do something so simple, and that she needed to be re-trained, and some other pretty harsh stuff. Not to mention, he also swiped a few dollars from our tip jar. This story is actually pretty funny, but another time. Anyway, I wasn't working there yet when this took place; this is just what I have been told. This had already caused him to get a store ban for 6 months.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning we were completely slammed. The line wrapped almost all the way around the store and we had at least 15-20 orders pending, with 4-6 drinks being made. currently We can typically only make 2 or 3 drinks at a time for each of us (usually two baristas make drinks - this isn't necessarily important, just helps more with the situation). Cappuccino Man leans over and asks me how long it will take to get his drink. I eyeball the very long line of orders, and tell him 15 minutes at the most. Most drinks are made in less than 45 seconds to a minute, depending on complexity. He gets visibly annoyed once I tell him this, and asks if I can \"just make his drink now so he can leave\". I apologize and tell him I cannot do that, as we have to do our drinks in order and it just wouldn't be fair to other customers. One thing that can be annoying is when people see how incredibly busy we are and then get upset when it takes longer than 3 minutes to complete an order, but I digress. He doesn't say anything in response, and just steps back and continues watching me and my co-worker make drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I get to his drink. Before I can even start preparing his order, he calls over to my other co-worker that's making drinks, and says to him: \"Hey, can you make my drink instead? I don't have time to wait on her.\", while pointing at me. Immediately, I got annoyed. But, I just handed over the order to my co-worker and kept it moving. I make two other drinks, and just as I'm starting to calm down, I'm called over by Cappuccino Man. Since he had already annoyed me a bit, I didn't want to be dramatic and start anything, but I knew he was going to ask me to remake it. I decided I would question him on what exactly happened instead of just bending over backwards again, to hopefully make some kind of change. Food/customer service workers are still just people, man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, he claimed it tasted \"off\". I pushed a bit and asked what was wrong, even re-reading through his order to \"make sure\" it was what he had ordered. He said the thought the problem was with the milk's density. I asked, is it too much or too less foam? He said he couldn't really put his finger on it, and asked me to remake it. I said I would make it again, but I wouldn't know what to change if I didn't know what was wrong, so it would be pointless. To be fair, we do ask what needs to be changed or what seems to taste incorrectly when we remake drinks so we're not playing a guessing game and wasting product. Then, he asked if my manager was there and that he would like to speak to him. I grab my manager and they talk for a few minutes, so I see this as an opportunity to sit in the back for a second to calm down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCappuccino Man leaves, but not before speaking to another customer, who I'm assuming he knows personally, saying \"oh, don't let the girl in the blue hat make your drink\" loud enough for me to hear over espresso machines running and milk steaming, which isn't exactly quiet. It was so completely embarrassing, especially with all of these people in the store and in front of my boss. I wanted to cry, honestly. My manager comes in the back and talks to me, asking why I didn't just remake his drink. I explain how I felt and apologised, but also stood up for myself. I told him I can handle a lot of things, but he was agitating me and I know I'm not incompetent.  I asked if it was possible to report and/or ban him, and I know I'm not the only employee who felt this way. However, Boss Man didn't really care for my side of the story. \"He's a regular, we can't lose customers, he has no reason to be banned, you need to not be so aggressive, this is grounds for a write-up\" etc. I understand that I have to have that \"the customer is always right\" attitude, and I can't put someone on blast for wanting a remade drink. He may not be purposefully trying to be difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotten mixed responses on how I should or shouldn't have handled it from friends and family, how I was being unprofessional or how my actions were justified, but I can't help feeling bad for acting that way towards someone older than myself, and to a customer at the very least. Did I fuck up? Was this really necessary?",

Strangely, on the day he went on vacation with his family and couldn't talk to her she suddenly called.

Now, you may say, \"But elaboratenoodle! Horses are so expensive — you are very privileged!\" However, I can assure you that we are far from wealthy — the horses are our only \"splurge,\" and I don't enjoy or ever ride them. Because of the horses, my mother has disrupted our lives in a bunch of little ways, but the biggest issue was when she moved our whole family to a different county in order to buy a farm, which meant leaving all of my friends behind and moving to an area where the closest grocery store is almost half an hour away, and going to my office (which I only do once a week) takes almost an hour. But, the little things are just as bad — things like selling our beloved pop-up camper to buy a horse trailer. Now, as every pre-teen has inevitably been told, *owning horses is expensive*. And, yeah, it can be. However, the prices goes up significantly when the two perfectionists that are my parents decide to purchase *a farm*, a brand new truck, a tractor, and a horse trailer.\n\nMy parents are pretty smart, but all of these things are pretty financially taxing, and I know we're in a lot of debt. Now, don't get me wrong: I still have an amazing life, and my parents really do care about and love me and my siblings. They even helped me to buy my first car, and pay for my insurance. Still, I still am not happy about this horse scenario. Because we are in debt, I feel *really* guilty whenever they spend money on me at all — I've started paying for my own tuition, a lot of my own food, and I will occasionally secretly cover their grocery bills when I go shopping. But, it's taken a toll on our lives: we avoid making necessary repairs to our house and our cars, paying the taxes is always an ordeal, and we can't afford to go on any trips.\n\nNow, I understand that it's their money, and I appreciate everything that they do for me. But now, I'm preparing to go to college, and their income is high enough to prevent me from getting good financial aid, but because they spend it so foolishly, they can't afford to even help me a little, like paying for my books or helping me out with the cost of housing. And I know that I don't deserve any of their money, but I am still not thrilled about the prospect of owing \\~$100,000 for college (and no, I am not going to community college; the closest \"community\" college is farther away than several four-year universities).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nSo, as you can tell, I am not super thrilled about the horses, and they've been a lot of trouble from my perspective. But, they are really something she enjoys, and a way for her to connect with my sister. Okay, great. But, one challenge is that my sister chose to attend a brick and mortar school, meaning that only myself and my mother are home during the day. Because of this, my mom often tries to guilt me into helping her with the \"daily chores,\" which include obsessively cleaning up after her horses, as well as brushing them, feeding them, and occasionally riding them.\n\nUnfortunately, I am very busy at all times: I have an intense course load (trust me, it's not the type of online school you're thinking of), in addition to a bunch of extracurriculars, as well as my responsibilities as my company's only web developer / IT specialist / technical support representative. I have a crazy life, but I am very lonely and depressed, which isn't great when combined with a huge workload. I am awake and working from about 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM, I have no local friends outside of work (and all of those people are a lot older than me), and the only time I get out of the house is when I go to the office or go skiing with my dad (we got really cheap season passes for which I had to pay most of the price). My mom, however doesn't really have time for this either, as she also works, in addition to having to take care of the house during the day, but I really don't think it's fair for me to expect me to add even more chaos to my life for these stupid animals — chaos that leaves me covered in filth for the rest of my day. I feel guilty for leaving her so much work, but I really do not need more stress in my life right now. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My mother has thrown our lives into chaos because of her horses, and I don't want to help take care of them.",

I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. \n\nThis year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. \n\n\n So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”\n\nHer response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”\n\nI’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. \n\nMe: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”\n\nH: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”\n\nMe: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”\n\nH: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”\n\nMe: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”\n\nHer: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”\n\nMe: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.”\n\nHer: “Whatever.”\n\nSo AITA here?",

This is more because my little brother (12y/o) adores him, my brother is fantastic at basketball and his dad's a great coach for him and even though I don't get sports I think he genuinely has a future in it, he just got invited to his first national tournament. Okay now that the background is out of the way here's the situation.\n\nSo about 3 months ago I got a letter from the local power company saying that I was 1,000 dollars in debt to them from 2013, but here's the thing I was 13 at the time. So I called them to figure out what happened and once they told me the street address I immediately recognized it belonged to my old step dad. Obviously I was furious, so I talked to my mom about it to make sure she didn't give him permission to do anything like this, because he's a great manipulator and that was about the time they were thinking of getting back together (they didn't) and she assured that she would never let something like that happen and she was just finding out about it as well\n\nMy mom called him and told him to either pay the debt or have it put back into his name. But the problem with that is he's currently living out of a tent in a friend's backyard so I know for a fact he won't be able to pay it but once it's out out of my name it's not my problem. He tells her that he'll do it and I thought that was that\n\nYesterday I call the power company so I can make sure that this won't affect my credit or anything because I have no idea how that works and it's better to be safe than sorry seeing as how I'm planning on moving out in the next couple of months. So after asking her to check my name in their system the lady asks me \"How would you like to pay your debt?\" and  I was LIVID (obviously I didn't take this out on her shes just doing her job) and I explained that I was minor at the time and she transfers me over to the debt collectors agency and after explaining that I was minor to a 2nd woman she helps me file a letter of dispute. But then she tells me that the power company may require me to file a police report and name anyone who I might think is a suspect if I want this to be taken out of my name.\n\nIt's hard because when I was his exact age my dad started drinking heavily and fell out of my life and that was hard one me. I don't want my little brother to go through that too, seeing as how this is punishable by up to 5 years in prison where we live. We're also super close, the kid is genuinely one of my best friends and I don't want him to resent me even if his dad doesn't end up getting jail time. Obviously he knows nothing about any of this and I'd like to keep it that way but if I have to file a police report he's eventually going to find out.\n \nSo if I file this police report WIBTA?",

So I stopped hanging out with her.\n\nI found out that her boyfriend might have been involved in a high-profile rape case, a pretty major thing. So I looked into it a bit, it looked like a case of mistaken identity, and that the actual person involved was his cousin or brother or something. They just had similar names. This is all based on an internet witch hunt, and those are not very accurate anyway. I knew that the witch hunt did target him though.\n\nI discovered that his cousin/brother/whatever was in junior high during the events of the rape case, and it looks like everyone else involved was in highschool, so I kept looking into it. Eventually I found out through a different source that one of his friends was involved in \"revenge porn\". Even if he wasn't the one involved in the rape case  directly, the fact that he's hanging out with people like that after  going through that witch hunt, after he saw that kind of revenge porn ruin someone's life. Well that's a huge red flag, and I couldn't keep  setting on it.\n\nThe problem is that it's all conjecture. I couldn't get any details of the \"revenge porn\" without pushing someone harder than I wanted to, and while it certainly looks like he was one of the rapists, the fact is that I'm basing that judgment off of a witch hunt. A witch hunt that got 2 people convicted (to probation, it was described in the news as a miscarriage of justice), but a witch hunt none the less.\n\nSo I let his girlfriend know what was going on. The guy phones me, understandably angry, and talks to me a bunch of facebook. After talking to him, I only feel more confident that he was involved. But I also have an obvious bias against the guy.\n\nIt really wasn't my place to get involved, especially where I had a crush on her, and I created a bunch of drama for what could have been no reasons. I feel like machiavellian asshole who got the two of them broken up for my own selfish reasons, and while under normal circumstances I would have pursued her I feel like if I did that in the future it would just be proving to myself how much of an asshole I am.",

They have 2 weimaraners and they are absolutely insane. They've had then for about 2 years and they both stay inside always. They do not listen, they bark incessantly, and they will jump all over you and scratch the shit out of you with their claws and gnaw at your hands with their mouths. What angers me the most is the wife always makes up some kind of excuse for their behavior.\n\n\"Oh they're just excited\"\n\"She's just showing affection\"\n\"I would never put my dogs outside, you wouldn't put your kids outside would you?\"\n\nI get it. People love dogs and cats and I'm on the other side of that spectrum. I can tolerate and enjoy dogs but their not my thing.\n\nSo here's whats got me a frustrated.\n\nI recently gave my friend, J, his christmas gift. I gave him my deceased brothers Xbox One. My brother passed a couple years ago and I kept his xbox but it stayed in my basement collecting dust and since I have a ps4 I never really used it and it didnt seem fair to let it sit there. So I decided a month ago since me and J were getting along so well that he should receive it because he only has a xbox 360. \n\nSo we were texting tonight and he suggested i come over and bring my 4 year old daughter. Last time I brought her those dogs cornered her and scratched her legs with their paws. So I texted him and asked if he could rein his dogs in since my daughter didnt like being scratched(more like I'll kill a dog if they hurt her). His response was, 'I cant do anything about that.'   ....I'm trying to be a reasonable person but wtf man? Cant keep your dogs in check?? Or put them in the other room for a small amount of time? \n\nSo I say cmon man im just protecting my kid from scratches. He asks, 'What do you want me to do?'\n\nAt this point I'm hurt and fucking angry. I can feel my blood pumping over a stupidass text convo. I tell him I just dont want her scratched and all I get is 'i cant help that.' So I just tell him I'll come over when I'm not watching my daughter one day and thats the end of the conversation. \n\nAt this point I'm ready to say fuck it. I have had the shittiest day and I'm confused as to whether I'm not being reasonable and this is why I wrote this. Maybe the internet can clarify.

I probably missed a few, too.\n\nFor some reason I just can't conjure up any positive feelings for her; I care about my stepmom and I know for a fact that she cares about me but almost everything she does seems to stress me out; nothing seems to be good enough for her when I clean the house with my sister, and she loses her temper incredibly easily with us. If we ever say anything that contradicts her, she raises her voice at us for arguing with her, and tells us that we never do anything she tells us to; that maybe she should just become harder on us if we're going to be like that. She just lashes out in anger and rarely tries to make up afterwards, even going as far as to say that it's our fault for pissing her off and being so uncooperative in the first place. And any perceived sign of disrespect (real or not) at all is immediately pointed out and I'm scolded for it. Recently, when I revealed that I feel safer talking with my biological mother (who has a history of drug abuse and is very financially unstable, on top of the fact that she use to stand us up during visitation. Still, I feel like I can talk to her and trust her more) , she launched into this huge, night-long lecture about how ungrateful I am for the work she puts into us, and how she loves us more than that woman ever could, and that if I wanted to be with our biological mom so badly then why don't we try and live with her. Any little thing can piss her off, and she launches into a lecture about how I need to have good grades so I don't end up in my parent's basement like my biological mom did, or worse. One time, she started to yell at my sister who was hyperventilating and obviously having an anxiety attack from already being chewed out for her grades. Occasionally, my stepmom changes up rules when they've always been a certain way, and pretends like it's always been like that. Because of her temper and different way of thinking, I never feel like I could share my inner thoughts around her; they always get targeted as some form of disrespect or they get shrugged off as childish. Both of my parents never seem to take me seriously, and treat me like I know nothing. My stepmom is also incredibly passive aggressive to everybody in the house; even my dad. I'm honestly just afraid of her; she never seems to be able to control her feelings and I can't relax while she's in the house because she'll probably find something to get stressed about.\n\nI'm not even a bad kid; I try my hardest in school and I really try to make my parents happy because I care about them. I used to love my stepmom but for some reason that feeling's just faded entirely into an urge to get the hell out of this house.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I really enjoy cooking, so I'd often treat the guys to a big meal once every 2 weeks or so where everyone would pitch in and I'd cook the main course. This was the norm for the fall, but now 2 of my roommates Aaron and Stan (fake names) are on a diet and prefer going out every week for an expensive cheat meal. I was happy that I didn't have to plan a week ahead, but also sad that I couldn't cook for anyone but myself anymore. This past week I go up to Aaron and Stan and ask to make them a cheat meal, and they agree on my idea for mac &amp; cheese. I ask if I can make it a dinner party and invite some of my friends and they agree with that as well, making the total amount of people about 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAaron lets me know that he and Stan are more concerned about their meal and doesn't want to pay for everyone else's food. Understandable, since it was my idea to invite everyone. I ask him how much he thinks he and Stan will eat and he says 2lbs each. Using how much I've eaten in the past and how much Aaron and Stan will eat, I get what I think will enough pasta and cheese to satisfy everyone, which was about $50 worth and I get reimbursed by Aaron and Stan $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets weird. Aaron demands that he grate the cheese, not because he's especially good at it but because he missed his arm workout that day. I hand him the cheese and the grater and let him do whatever. Aaron takes the cheese and starts aggressively grating this cheese. Like, he's screaming and looks like he's trying to fist the plate into submission. After one poor, poor pound of cheese he moves onto the next one. I take the cheese and take a look at it before I dump it in the pot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few tiny, red specks in there.\n\nHe cut himself on the grater and is bleeding into the cheese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm surprised and disgusted, but I didn't want to say anything because he's acting like a raving lunatic. Right before the first mac &amp; cheese batch is done, the guests arrive. I finish the meal, toss on some breadcrumbs, and have all 12 dig in. Everyone's complimenting the meal, so I at least know that no one's poisoned from Aaron's lunacy. It took them about 15 minutes for all 12 guests to give up, with both pots less than half empty (Each pot had about 3lbs of food).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm pretty upset. I now have $50 worth of cheese and noodles that I don't know what to do with, except make mac &amp; cheese for the next month. Aaron and Stan wildly overestimated the amount of food that they would eat, and let's not forget how Aaron BLED INTO THE FOOD. I've already seen the wrappers of the other cheese that I bought in the trash and everyone's avoiding each other. Am I the asshole for getting moody about my roommate's food habits, even though some have been the norm for months? Am I the asshole for willingly letting guests eat food with blood in it?",

I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. ",

My parents often threaten to kick me out because I don’t often conform to their rules (since they have always been controlling, I sometimes rebel against them when I feel like they’re being unfair) so my anxiety is through the roof at that point. (side note: I hadn’t brought up any problems with my parents since we got back together).  My ex and I had plans to see each other but before we meet up I tell him what had just happened between my parents and I.

I mailed to her some gifts over Christmas, and she didn't even have the decency to let me know she received it. I only knew she received it when I recently asked the mutual friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite wanting to consider that she might really be having personal difficulties and not wanting to be guilt tripped for being upset over all of this, I still eventually decided I’ve had enough.\n\nI unfollowed her on Instagram, later also removing her \"cats account\" from my followers, and I left the WhatsApp group chat. We are still on each other's Facebook, though she hasn't posted anything in 3 months. Either that, or she has been only posting to selected audiences to view (something she has done to others before). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left things at that, but last week I received a tracked parcel from her. It contained some items which I guess are gifts she got for me over the months and held onto, maybe waiting for a time to meet up... I don't know, maybe even thinking that is presumptuous. There was also a 'thank you' card in which she wrote \"Thanks for everything. Take Care.\" Not sure what kind of context that should be interpreted though.\n\nReceiving this now feels too little too late, and it no longer matters as much as it used to anymore.  Am I the asshole?",

He turns to me and asks what I'm going to do about the meal he's going to for his mother during the day. I'm like, I dunno I'll sort something.

I ask him if he's thought about what he's just asked me to do. I burst out crying and just sob. He apologises, frequently, over the next hour. I'm still pretty upset, so I just say it's fine.

            "input": "  \n\nSome backstory: My husband lost his construction job in 2017 just before winter in the Midwest. I decided to take a job offer with better pay and worse hours (80+ hours a week) so my husband could stay home and study for his CDL. He claimed to want a more stable career. \n\nThis continues for several months until I completely burn myself out trying to manage the kids (4) and the household while working so much. My husband decided to start looking for a job again, putting a pin in the CDL goal. He found a job that took him away from home for 3-4 months at a time working in agricultural construction this past spring. While he was gone I decided to go back to college online. \n\nHe worked there for four months before he **intentionally** got fired (he told me this). During this time he was striking up conversations with an ex, who has been a continuous dark cloud over our relationship because of my own insecurities. He then comes back to Indiana and tells his father I said he wasn’t allowed back home because he didn’t have a job (I never said these words and I didn’t know he was coming back home until after he’d already returned to the state.) \n\nHis father gives him an under-the-table job two hours away from our home, so my husband has been staying with his dad and his uncle for the last six months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been trying to get a handle on our money because I am hoping to go to law school and my credit report doesn’t look so great. I started working on a budget this afternoon and four hours later I had all the finances in one place. While my husband and I were texting about our days, I sent him a photo of what I’d done for the day. He makes an inaccurate comment about how we would have “$500 left over a month.” \n\nI explain to him we wouldn’t have any left-overs anymore because I was doing a zero-based budget. I joke that I didn’t think he would read everything so closely and he shuts down for a moment. He then goes into it, telling me how he needs to pay his dad back for all the charity and is upset I didn’t consult with him. \n\nI try explaining to him these numbers were based on whether or not my ex-husband would pay his child support payments on time every week (which he hasn’t done for 11 years, but they started up again recently). He then takes offense that I used his name and ends the conversation before “it leads to a stupid ass argumentative tone that ends up with us getting nasty with each other”. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t finished explaining the budget but he wanted to end the conversation without letting me explain. So I messaged him anyway. He goes off, implying I think he should screw over his father and telling me “it’s nice you can write the whole budget without even asking if I have any debts I need to settle”. (Him not being considerate of me has been an ongoing issue in our relationship – including him disappearing for hours into the early morning with his friend to get high and not calling me – and it has never been a problem for the past three years that I’ve managed the finances without “consulting” him.)\n\nI threw my hands up. I’m functioning as a single mother of four, in college full-time, one of my children has ODD/ADD and I’m driving back and forth to the school twice a week for a problem, my kids have 2-3 out of school activities a piece, I’m the only one cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, paying the bills, dealing with household problems.\n\nI acknowledge on a weekly basis how much it means to me that my husband works so hard and keeps a steady income so we can pay for necessities. I give him massages every time I see him because he’s in manual labor. I do not feel like I downplay what he does at all. I do not receive the same acknowledgment.\n\nI told him he could hand the finances, then, and he agreed. I gave him every password to every account.  He states we’re going to have a surplus of cash because he didn’t know what half the accounts were (I only sent him our utilities, two credit cards we don’t use, the internet log in, our car insurance, and our debt consolidation payment). He then tells me the bills will just “have to wait” until he has better internet service. \n\nI tell him I would take that as a sign of being apathetic to the needs of his family. I told him “since I’ve been doing such a shitty job handling the finances, there’s no reason for money to continue to touch my hands”. He claims I put words in his mouth and then said “fuck you” to me. I told him he didn’t say it, but he implied it. I wrote down a nicer way he could have asked. \n\nHe tells me I blew shit out of proportion “in a feminine manner” and that I “make \\[him\\] look like a dumbass”. (There were just the two of us texting???) I asked him if he thought my opinions, thoughts, words, and ideas don’t matter because I have a vagina.\n\nHe exact words were “Well, if the stereotypical shoe fits, makeover them Pradas”. (I don’t even know what this means, the most expensive pair of shoes I own I got on clearance for less than $30.) At this point, I stop responding to him because it’s not getting anywhere and he’s being ridiculous.\n\nAfterward, he called me on the phone and demanded my email account information. I told him I didn’t want to give it to him and told him it was not because I have anything to hide, but because of the nasty way, he demanded it. He told me to shut the fuck up. I hung up on him. \n\nHe called back and asked if I was done being a bitch. I hung up again. \n\nHe called back and started screaming at me. At one point he accused me of thinking I’m always right about everything (which is completely untrue and I’ve, on more than just one occasion, admitted to being wrong/defeated, and I’m not a spoiled sport about it). I told him he was being disrespectful by calling me names and telling me to “shut up”. I said I wanted a divorce and that I didn’t want a partner who couldn’t be mad without disrespecting me. He mocked me and told me he wouldn’t sign papers.\n\nI told him I didn’t need his signature and that the courts grant contested divorces. He finally stopped screaming at me and said “Fine, I’ll sign your damn papers and find somewhere else to live”. And he hung up.",

I won't go into too many details as I don't want to be traced back by people that know me. \nBasically, me and my girlfriend have been together for a few years now (we are both in our early 20ies) but recently (I'd say 1 year-ish) I've completely lost feelings for her, and yet, I'm still with her.\nNow, the reason why I have not broken up with her is because one of her relatives was really sick and in and out of hospitals, so I felt like making sure she was ok was my responsibility and my first priority. The problem was that, even tho I \"love\" her, I haven't been \"in love\" with her for a while now, so I wouldn never initiate sex or cuddles, and being affectionate towards her looked very forced and fake on my part.\nBecause of this dilemma, I feel like I might have done more bad than good as she is not stupid, and even though she hasn't mentioned anything, she probably knows something is up, which means I might have just made her sadder for the past year instead of helping her at all. \n\nNow, a little over a month a go, this relative passed away so I've spent nearly every day with her, and it seems like there will never be a good time to tell her I've lost feelings for her, and that I want to end the relationship. \n\n\nAITA for staying with her?

We did a lot of stuff over the past few months: went to dinner together, got breakfast a few times, and I supported her at all of her soccer matches (we go to the same college). She's had a fucked up year and has been so courageous through all of the trials. I made sure I was a friend who was always there if she needed to vent.\n\nThen, her friends started to ask her if we were dating, apparently even one of the guys from the men's soccer team got jealous. People thought we were a couple. We looked good together. When I make her laugh, I see people looking over at us and smiling. We looked like a couple. She noticed that and for whatever reason made her uncomfortable. She proceeded to avoid me for two weeks. This is the first time she avoided me. I approached her about it, she told me everything, profusely apologized and that was that. Fast forward to February.\n\nIf people thought we were a couple and we looked good together, she'll say yes if I ask her out right? I got a soft no, she wanted to stay friends. I told her if she needs space I'm more than okay with that as I probably need space too. After a bit of thinking over the next week, I was confused as to how she could say no. I understand there might not be attraction, but this was more than a friendship, we were borderline dating. So that got me mad. AITA for being mad about her not feeling the same way? I understand some people just don't feel some type of way for others, but we were doing things that couples do.\n\nThen tonight, after over a month of no communication, I checked in to see if we were cool. She said yeah and apologized if she made me feel like she was avoiding me (we used to bump into each other a lot so I should have seen her at least once, she's definitely avoiding me). I didn't want conflict so I acted like she hasn't been ignoring me and said, \"Nah not really, I wanna give u space and it's been good for me, but I didn't wanna get completely cut off yknow?\" Ambiguous statement, but I was referring to the future. I didn't want one month of no communication to turn into a few months. She took it as though I accused her of cutting me off for the past month and got triggered: \"I'm not sure how I cut you off? Literally just haven't seen you?\" That really set me off. We used to see each other at lunch every Tuesday and Thursday but I haven't seen her in over a month. I texted her happy bday, she didn't text me on mine (few days apart). Hasn't texted me once since I asked her out. Literally has done everything in her power to avoid me. AITA for being mad these things?\n\ntl;Dr\n\nAsked a friend out after we were pretty much dating. Her friends and my friends thought we were dating. I got shot down AITA for being mad that she said no?\n\nAfter I asked, a month went by. I texted her to check up, she thought I accused her of cutting me off (which I think she did) which really pissed me off. AITA?",

She's a medium sized dog and if you go through my profile you'll find pictures of her.\n\nEveryday when I walk her and run into my neighbors they let out a shrill gasp, they jump away, they act like she's a monster who just said \"Boo\".

After graduating last year, we’ve only talked once when she needed somewhere to stay for a night because her and her boyfriend got in a fight. \n\nI said sure. She leaves the next morning and we, again, have no contact for about 5 months. \n\nOne day she calls my suite mate, a close friend who I share apartment with, and tells us both that her boyfriend randomly kicked her out. She has no where to go besides her parents house, they’re both raging alcoholics, and asks if she can just stay one night with us. We say yes. \n\nShe tells us all about how she never saw it coming and she has no idea what to do. My suitemate asks me if it’s okay if M moves in with us for the time being. This is risky for us; if our school finds out she’s living with us we would suffer all the repercussions. We both agree to let her stay because we would feel horrible if she had to move back in with her parents. \n\nA few weeks pass and she’s keeping contact with her ex-boyfriend. Both I and my suite-mate A repeatedly tell her we aren’t okay with this, and that we don’t want to be her parents but we let her live with us to get away from him. One night she tells us she’s going to stay with a friend, and we find out she lied to us and went and stayed at her ex-boyfriend’s house. \n\nSuitemate tells her that if she gets back with ex-boyfriend, she’s not living with us. \nWithin a week of this, M brings him over to our dorm to move all of her stuff out and says she’s going back to live with her ex-boyfriend. \n\nNot even two days later she calls and says they got in another fight. Both I and my suite mate let her move back in. \n\nAbout a week passes and I realize she’s still talking to her ex-boyfriend every day. I warn her, in the nicest way possible, that this can’t happen again and I think it’s best to cut contact completely. She shrugs this off and tells me they’re just friends. \n\nOn Valentines she tells us she’s going to stay with her mom, and then posts two pictures with her ex-boyfriend on Instagram that have obviously been taken that day.\n\nMy suite-mate and I decided together to confront her and text her a simple, “So you’ll be coming over tomorrow to get your stuff?” Keep in mind that we’ve made it very clear that she is moving out if she gets back with this guy. She texts back “what?” and we tell her we don’t appreciate repeatedly being lied to, and that we aren’t trying to parent her but that the one rule was that we weren’t going to let her live with us rent-free to get away from her boyfriend if they were STILL DATING.\n\nMy question is, are we the assholes for giving her that one guideline to live with us? It was completely rent free and we never asked her to clean or help with anything, just that she not get back with her boyfriend that had kicked her out twice. A few people have told me we should have confronted the issue differently and we were bitches the way we handled it. ",

Kinda a long post so here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's sort of a lot of background to get through, I guess, for it to make a little more sense. My mum is a single-mother. Dad walked out when I was young, the typical story.  Basically, in my hometown, the only members of my family are me, my mum (who I'll call M) and my step-grandad (I'll label G here.) M's been obsessively protective of me throughout my entire life -- she basically cut herself off from anyone who wasn't me, and frequently told me things like how she doesn't \"**need any friends**\" because she \"**has me**\" and how I'm all she needed. I'm entirely aware of how unhealthy that is, don't worry. Throughout most of my teen years I frequently encouraged her to get out more and form actual connections that weren't me or her family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I eventually (clearly not what M wanted) moved three hours out of my hometown to go to university, and well, she took it with a mixed bag. But I thought she was coping well. Then recently, on call with her, she mentions how she's found a potential new job; and it's a job she's really been wanting to get for a while now. At first I'm happy for her -- but then she mentions it's way outside of my hometown. Immediately, my thoughts go to *G*\\- he has literally no one else in the town. The rest of our family don't bother contacting him (since he's only a step-relation, ties were cut after my Grandma died) and he's at that life stage where a lot of his friends are gone. M's about the only person he has left that still visits outside of nurses and such.  He's provided for and helped us for so long, the thought of him ending up alone is just, well, awful for me. He's well into late 80s, and his health isn't exactly well. My worry is if something happens and he just has no one around him to help. Or even anyone to talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM seemed surprised, and I think that she'd forgotten to even consider him, but she got angry at me for not supporting her after so long of telling her she needed to get out more and be ambitious. She pointed out that, well, she's not his caretaker or anything, so she doesn't have to stay and look after him. She also rightly brought up that *I* left without much debate about leaving him, so it's hypocritical of me. I'm less sure of that since well... I left thinking that she'd be there. Getting to the point, we got in a massive argument over it, where I brought up that she wasn't really considering anyone other than herself and that she had other things to consider before making a big move like that.  \n\nThis is without mentioning that said job would also be way closer to where my Uni is, so she'd effectively be moving to me. This didn't slip my attention either.\n\nWe fought, we called each other selfish, it was a bit of a yelling match over the phone and we haven't spoken a lot since. She did, however, tell the rest of the family who've contacted me trying to explain her side. \n\nThis includes G, who says that he just wants M to be happy. Which is what I expected from him, really. But it doesn't make me any less worried about him being left behind in his last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I'm just worrying -- because I'm starting to see it from her point of view. For years I've gone on to her about pursuing what she wants to do, but when she turns around and says she's going to, I've essentially said \"no not like that\". I just really don't like the idea of my grandad being alone but I'm beginning to think telling my mum that I didn't approve of what she wants to do might have been the wrong move. She clearly felt really passionate about this job opportunity, and she was excited to tell me. And I just shut her down because I didn't really think about how much she'd wanted this. AITA?",

Everything was fine until the 4th night when I found a cockroach near my bed. I have a really bad phobia of insects in general(particularly roaches), and it crawled under my bed. I contacted staff members through the app and was generally being difficult: asking them to come deal with it, to pack my luggage up for me as it was right next to the bed and threatening to leave a bad review. They were unable to do anything, giving me excuses about the shop and stores selling roach bait being closed( literally just hit 9 pm). The staff member also accused me of leaving open food around ,telling me to just go if \"I do not like here\" and promising to back the fee for tonight. After an hour or two of literally just staring at my luggage from meters away I quickly packed my stuff up, stored my luggage at the reception and left. I slept at a Manga cafe and returned in the morning to get my luggage. When I asked for a refund for my 4th night two days later ( they still haven't refunded me) they typed in broken English telling me to be a man and to not still think like a kid. The fee came through later. I know roaches are common in Japan especially in the summer, but I don't think what i did was wrong. I didn't even leave a bad review or cause a scene considering that the hostel was attached to a restaurant managed by the same company(customers were eating there when this happened). AITA?",

I found the comic quite nice. It made a point I agreed with. I support legalisation of weed 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I think that people who smoke weed, while knowing it's illegal, should not be surprised, and angry when they get punished for it, because they consciously decided to break the law. I argued, that even if the ban on drugs is completely stupid, they can't just go against the law, and then complain, how unjust everyting is. I don't want to smoke weed, but I like occasionally drinking alcohol, so to relate to the situation, I imagined that alcohol is banned, just like weed. I argued, that while I'd be just as outraged as them, I could hold myself back, because not breaking the law comes natural to me. (Just as a side note because I didn't include this in the argument: I have a pretty rebellious nature, and I like complaining about unjust things, but after several arguments, and fights with my parents, I learned, that complaining doesn't get me anywhere, it won't change the law, and it doesn't oblige me to break the law)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to seem like an ass, but I didn't really understand the arguments of the other side. They rephrased my sentences, replacing words, and asking questions. It didn't give me anything to think about, I could only repeat what I said in my first comment. They compared my views on weed smokers to people protesting against authoritian governments, and german people trying to shelter jews from nazis. I want to be respectful, and consider all sides, but I honestly don't know how thos relate to what I said \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe full argument can be read in my comment history.

I feel terrible and want some advice on how to handle the situation because I love my grandmother dearly. \n\nA little background information, I grew up living close to my grandma and seeing her several times a month. Shes the grandparent I would consider myself closest to. Around a year ago I moved out of state for school and am now around 2000 miles away, so I only see her a few times a year. Even still, I feel like our relationship is strong. My grandma lives in a tiny town that no one in my family lives near anymore because everyones jobs took them elsewhere. Because of this, she says shes lonely. She is single and has two cats. She got her cats about a year ago after her old one passed away and these cats are her life. She says they have separation anxiety and she cant leave them alone or with anyone else for more than three hours. She said they will stop eating and may try hurting themselves if she is gone for too long. She stopped visiting my father/mother (3 hours drive away) around six months ago and says they have to come to her because she can't leave her cats. That being said, shes mentioned leaving for day trips with her brother and sister before and says her neighbor is a trusted cat sitter who the cats are comfortable with. She has no physical disabilities and is only 70. She retired two years ago and still drives herself/goes shopping weekly/goes out with friends and siblings every time I talk with her. \n\nMy fiance and I just booked our wedding venue and are opting to have it in a location that is in between all of our guests. Everyone is spread out so everyone will have to travel a bit. When I told my grandma about this, she said she was sorry to hear I wasnt getting married within an hour or two of her and she would be unable to come. She said at first it was because she had no money. My father and I both told her we would happily pay for her transport , lodging, food, everything. It's that important to me she is there. Then, she said it was because of the cats. I asked if her brother or sister could take care of them for 1-3 days (they live ten minutes away) or if her cat sitting neighbor could help out. She said it wouldn't be possible because their lives would be put at risk. In my opinion, shes putting her cats over her granddaughter. It hurts badly and I cant understand why she is being like this.\n\nI told my father I think she may have a mental illness and if he had any ideas for help, but he and the rest of my family laugh it off and just say shes \"a crazy cat lady\". \n\nIt seems to me like she will not be attending, even though she is physically capable,financial capable with family assistance, has no other obligations, just is irrationally worried for her cats. I love my own cat dearly and can understand wanting it to be safe and comfortable while I'm away, especially if it has anxiety, but it seems like my grandmother may be projecting her own feelings of anxiety onto her pets.\n\nHolidays are coming and I cant help feeling upset about my grandmother. I feel almost angry towards her for deciding not to attend. I feel like I cannot mention the wedding at holidays if she is near because she is upset with me for having it more than an hour and a half away.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

She may be one of the grossest, most unclean person I know and cannot keep something clean to save her life no matter how often asked by others. She is just drop dead lazy. I would have been 15 at the time of the first incident, she would have her stuff all over the bathroom (shared by both of us) and would constantly spill makeup and oral care products over the counter. I'd ask her to clean it up and she would say yes and continue to never do it. This would go back and forth continuing the same pattern over a couple weeks. Until one day I got my mother involved to ask her to clean in, in which she hesitantly obliged.\n\nThe clean bathroom would last for about a week and then back to the same old disgusting mess after that. Over the next 4 years it would get worse with the slop expanding to living spaces and the kitchen, never cleaning up after herself even when asked by my mother and father. \n\nThis brings us to tonight after I have absolutely had enough of it, me and my mother got into a yelling match going back and forth. My mother finally says that's she's done all she can and that my sister won't listen to her. I then told her that she should kick her out (she does not contribute to the household or pay rent at the age of 22) which ultimately made my mother cry. \n\nNow kids making your mother cry always makes you the asshole, however in this circumstance are my views unjust? Am I the asshole?",

I'm not comfortable explaining exactly what was up, but it's like if you're having issues with weird leg and foot pain that feels like pins and needles and you know your friend has diabetic neuropathy, even if you're not diabetic, you may ask them about neuropathy because neuropathy is nerve damage often in the hands and feet so it's vaguely related. So I asked my friend and they said my issue sounds like the beginnings of them being diagnosed with a certain condition, and I replied along the lines of \"Thank you for your help, but I hope it's not that\" because it's an incurable condition that from what I understand will continue to get worse and is also supposed to be pretty painful. My friend got super offended and started saying stuff like \"You don't want to be like me? Is it that bad to be like me you'd say that to my face?\"\n\nI don't get it. \n\nTo use another example but a real one this time, I have [trigeminal neuralgia]. If a friend described symptoms to me that sounded like TN, I'd not at all be offended if they said they don't want to have TN like I do, even if they said it to my face. It's totally normal to not want to have TN. In fact, if you want to have TN, there's probably something very very wrong with you. I totally understand not wanting to be like me in that I have TN. I don't want to have it either. \n\nThis could just be an issue of two people thinking very differently, but if it's not meant with any sort of \"I think people with X condition are lesser or inherently have a worse quality of life without me knowing what it's like to have X,\" I don't see the issue of stating in a conversation where it's relevant that you hope whatever you're experiencing isn't X. It's different to out of the blue say to someone you know has cancer or something that you're glad you don't currently have cancer like they do, for example. But this was relevant to our conversation, relevant to something I was experiencing related to my health, and I think it wasn't said in a rude way. \n\nThey've not really spoken to me since the issue resolved and I got the news all my labs were fine.\n\nAITA for how I responded to my friend?

They're quite prominent, but it doesn't bother me. I live in quite a sectarian city that I won't name. Catholics and Protestants have had a long hatred of eachother which has only started to recently cool a bit. I'm not a catholic in the religious sense, probably more agnostic, but I come from a catholic family. I should note, where I live, being a catholic generally equates to a nationalist while being a protestant generally equates to being a unionist. I am a non practicing catholic bordering on agnostic and am 100% nationalist. My girlfriend is not religious and is 100% unionist. \n\nSo after I got my ashes done we went out for the day. I didn't tell her I'd got them done so I thought it would be a bit of a shock, but not a big deal and we could laugh about it. When we met up, she immediatly told  me off for getting them, that I shouldn't have cause I'm not religious. She refused to walk next to me, and after saying I look like a retard she half-jokingly said that she didn't want to be seen with me and if she'd have known she'd have just went out with me tomorrow. she insisted I wash it off but I refused. While I might not be the most religious person, I am proud of where I come from, and I find that participating in religious events from my culture is a good way for me to express that. \n\nI told her if she was going to be like this then I'd simply get a bus home, she walked on past me. While I was waiting she texted me and essentially told me to come back, she was getting cold. When I got down to her, she was on the phone to her friend. Her friend was in the same place we were headed so she planned to meet up with her. This kinda hurt, it seemed like she wanted someone else to be around so she wasn't alone with me. Her friend is also protestant, and I didn't want to be made fun of by my SO and her friend. I made up a story about having a test to study for tomorrow so I had to go home. She gave me an annoyed \"bye\" and walked in the opposite direction. \n\nI don't see the problem, I like getting my ashes done, even it's not for explicitly religious reasons, it's just something I've always done. I don't agree with her political beliefs but I don't belittle her for it, I occasionally make light digs if it comes up in conversation and apologise if she thinks I went too far. \n\nThis happened about an hour ago and we haven't spoke since, normally, we'll both apologise in an argument, but I don't feel i should this time, I feel I've been treated wrongly for simply getting a black cross on my forehead\n\nSo Reddit, I know nobody wants to get involved in religious debates, but AITA?",

We are seeing very serious signs of emotional abuse and she eventually tells us of physical abuse as well. Not only this, but her depression has been even more extreme and she has frequent panic attacks, almost all with N being the cause of  stress. After  6 months of us telling her we will do anything to get her out and basically telling her she needs to leave him and she can live with either parent or myself, she decides to finally do what she needs to be better. She moves out of his house, breaks up with him and moves in with me (I have my own house about an hour away). She does all of this over one weekend, after deciding it is what's best for her.\n\nFast forward to 1 month later, after sitting on my couch for 2 weeks without a job, my parents buying her a car, all new furniture for her room, she decided she needed to give N a second chance. K also now denied all accounts of any emotional or physical abuse from N. K texted my family in a group text and basically demanded we accept her choice and tell her we love her, or she won't talk to us or be in our lives anymore. And this is something she would follow through with as she has shut some of us out for months at a time before.\n\nNow, currently a month after K got back together with N, all of her stuff is still at my house, but she has been living with him and his mom and stepdad while she waits to find her own place. K did decide she shouldn't live with N anymore, but that they should still be in a relationship.  \n\nNow she is asking me to let N come with her to my house and hang out and help her pack to move back. So, am I the asshole for not wanting to have anything to do with N?",

            "input": "Some background: my father put a lot of pressure on my education when I was younger and would basically claim that whenever I did well in school it was because of him, he isn't married to my mum, so I stopped contacting him. Last year my mum got a boyfriend who moved in with us even tho, he has a flat of his own and his daughter sleeps over pretty often too. Mum always said that I don't have to do well in school, but she wants me to be happy.\n\nA few weeks ago I got some bad grades, not terrible ones, but enough to notice. I'm mostly a good student, but I didn't have time to prepare for the lessons and had trouble with understanding some things in Maths.\n\nAfter seeing those my mother said that I should rethink my life and she doesn't want to hear any excuses from me. That stressed me out a lot, I'm afraid of being a disappointment. Later that week during a test I remembered the situation and couldn't focus on it anymore, so I did horribly.\n\nShe later messaged me (during a lesson) to talk about my grades and say she's worried. She also said that from her point of view it's \"a cry for help\" (I want to move out later this year and live with my girlfriend of 3 years, mother was fine with that). I told her how what she had said previously made me stressed and that I failed a test because of it. She replied that I should stop blaming her for my failings.\n\nI thought about the whole situation and asked my homeroom teacher to tell her that I'm doing perfectly fine, I'm pretty much the best in class and that it's okay to do badly sometimes. She didn't want to hear that from me, so I thought she would listen to the teacher.\n\nShe just came back from a parent-teacher conference and made sure to let me know how tired she was. She asked me, as if it were my fault, if I think it's okay for her to leave the house at 7:30 a.m. and come back at 8:30 p.m., she also asked me why I \"snitched\" on her (yes, she literally used this word) and why didn't I talk to her myself.\n\nSo AITA for not talking to her myself?",

            "input": "I want to give you guys a little idea about the context, so this post is probably going to be a little long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gf (20f) and I (21m) have a LDR. This obviously brings some difficulties, as we only see eachother every three months or so. We're both in uni, but she has been struggling alot with motivation and anxiety. She doesn't enjoy the path she's going and as a result has been very down the last months. She wants to quit uni, but has absolutely no idea what to do instead. I have been helping her as much as I can, I think. I am always trying to give her advice, help her with motivation, be supportive when she is feeling down etc. But I am getting a little frustrated about the fact that she is not following any advice i give her! I have been helping her with her with options she could explore instead of uni, i've told her that it would be good to get a therapist to help her with her anxiety (as I know I just simply fix that for her) etc. The problem is that, instead of working towards a solution, or trying to find a passion, she decides to do nothing. I know it is a scary situation to not know what the hell you want to do with your life, but the problem is that she has been getting angry with me because supposedly i am not helping her \"enough\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example is that would ask me: What should i do? Should I quit uni, should I continue? What would you do? My answer to this was simply: I would not continue with uni if you KNOW that it is not going to make you happy. \n\nShe then gets frustrated and tells me that I always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to tell her what to do! It's like she expects me to know exactly which career is going to make her happy? I really dont know either obviously. I told her that maybe you could go to the US for a couple months to study English, kinda like a gap year. But then she refuses to look into things like that. It's like she just expects to one day wake up and have found her passion. As you can understand this lethargy is making me slightly annoyed, because like I said, she refuses to actually take the advice that i give her, and then she gets mad at me for not helping her enough. Anyways, this was some background information. Now to the actual situation that I am dealing with now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night we were on the phone and the same subject came up. I could tell by her voice that something was wrong, so I asked her what was up. She then said that she was just confused because she doesnt know what the fuck she wants to do with her life. She then (again) told me that I am not helping her enough. Of course this kinda struck a nerve with me, because i have been doing everything i can to help her. Ive been doing a lot of research for her, exploring different options etc. Anyways, i responded with: \"babe, but you haven't been doing any of the things i told you! You haven't told your parents you want to go to a psychologist, you haven't been going to the gym, you haven't done the research to go to america, you havent read any books, you havent listened to any audiobooks on anxiety, you havent meditated, etc. I have given you so many options on how to feel better, but youre just not listening to me!\"  She then gets mad at me that i always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to help her.. So i try (for the millionth time) to give her my opinion on the matter, and i try to explain to her what i would do in her shoes. But as i try to talk, she just keeps interrupting me about everything i say. She doesn't let me talk at all and just keeps rambling on about how I don't care about her, how I don't help her enough etc. I keep asking her: can you stop interrupting me please? This literally goes on for 15 minutes, i just cant say 3 words withour her interrupting me, and telling me that im not supporitve enough. So now I am getting really frustrated, because i am trying to HELP her, but instead of listening to what i have to say she decides to interrupt me and ramble on about how i DONT help her. So yea, at this point im getting very very annoyed and angry, but i try to stay calm because we've had some prior issues about me \"yelling at her\" and she says that i have anger issues, even though i have never called her any bad names other than maybe \"hypocrite\", i've never threatened her etc, but yea she stills believes i have anger issues because i tend to raise my voice in arguments when i get frustrated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, back to the story. Gf and I are still on the phone, and i keep telling her: can i talk now? Are you done? Can i please talk without you interrupting me? So then i tell her that I am getting very frustrated that she doesn't let me finish my story, and that she really has to stop interrupting me. While i tell her this, she decides AGAIN to answer mid-sentence and i just get very angry and yell at her: Can you just SHUT UP AND STOP INTERRUPTING ME PLEASE! I admit I did yell this quite aggresively, but I was just so exasperated. After i yelled at her she tells me i broke the rule (of not yelling) and that she is done, that she cant be with someone that treats her so poorly, that i do not respect her, that no matter how many times she interrupts me i should NEVER disrespect her like that etc. I then tell her I did not treat her badly, and that she doesn't see her own flaws, and that I try everything to help her but that she just doesn't appreciate my help. I then hang up. She now demands that i apolize for my behavior, and that I promise her that I will get therapy to help me with my anger issues ( which i dont believe i have). So i refuse to apologize, and she wants to break up if i do not say sorry. So yea, thats where we are now. AITA for not apologizing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",

Her parents agreed that if we had a small and cheap ceremony they would pay for 100% of our honey moon and allow us to stay in their house (they plan on retiring there in a few years) for 3 weeks. I wasn't aware of this but one of the conditions of this was that my wife and I were supposed to stop in and say hello to multiple sets of their \"Belize friends.\" I think all told it's 5 different couples that we were supposed to make an appearance. As of yesterday, we were on couple 4 and while I was sort of annoyed that I wasn't made aware of this, couples 1 through 3 were nice people and the second set was these two hilarious gay dudes named Rod and Pete and Pete owns a helicopter who flew us all around to see the sites and that was awesome. \n\nCouple 4 was where shit hit the fan. They were much older, had obviously been fighting with each other and were super agitated. It was about 1000 degrees inside their house and they just sat and bitched the entire time about how their kids never call, how the husband's alcohol problem had flared up again, how the wife wanted to die because of her plantar fasciitis. We sat in these people's sweltering living room or almost 6 hours (that's not a joke) and we weren't offered so much as a drink and when I finally said I'd like some water, the kitchen was filthy as were the dishes and the husband was so shitty because I took a bottle of hot Dasani from under the sink. \n\nWhen we left,  I lost it with my wife. I told her that was one of the most miserable experiences of my life and those were two of the most miserable people I've ever met. She retaliated that those were two of her \"dearest friends\" and I was being super ungrateful to her parents who were paying for the trip. I told her that I wished her parents had made it clear that spending a full work day with American gothic on opiates was a condition of the honeymoon. She got so pissed at me that she called Rod and Pete to pick her up and I haven't seen her since yesterday evening. Her phone is either off or dead as my texts are not showing as delivered.

For backstory I'm a 18YO (M) depressed, anxious guy, I finished HS 1 year ago, and took a year off (basically spent 2018 doing absolutelly nothing) I never had a job, umfortunally depression got the best of me I guess. Anyway, yesterday my uncle came here to make dinner (paarents were on vacation, only me and my grandmother home) so, he is there doing whatever, and I'm here, playing on my 3DS, on an online match. Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \"dude, I'm cooking hurry\" and I say \"okay, lemme just--\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \"piece of shit\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \"obbeying\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy. All I do is take out the trash and help my gramma as she cannot move very well. That is not to say that I'm ungratefull for what everyone offers me (home, food, internet), I never complain, and I rarelly spend money since I dont leave my house really.

I got so pissed, I said \"Look  HE was wrong, he came to THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE house and started giving orders to me, and then hit me. I appreciate that he was making dinner, but NOBODY ASKED HIM TO, it was his choice, I could have made something else instead, so while im gratefull, Ill not suck his dick because of that\".

            "input": "I don't know if this fits here cause I'm also asking \"how am I the asshole\" because I genuinely don't know what I did but I must've done something.\n\nMy college roommate and I were paired up to be dorm roommates since first semester of college. We had a good relationship and moved into an apartment together the next year because we didnt have on campus housing. Things were great, we were good friends and spent most of our time watching tv together cause neither of us went out much. \n\nDuring the end of our junior year I got a boyfriend while on spring break. I'm very private about my relationships and rarely tell anyone if I dont have to. Once I returned from spring break I didn't have any desire to tell my roommate about this bf because in the past when i had opened up about relationships she was super judgmental to the point where I was upset the things she said. She is also exclusively into women so boys wasn't something we ever bonded over. I would've told her if he was going to be around but since it was long distance I figured it didnt affect her and wanted to avoid the judgement. \n\nWe hung out less and less as I spent more time at school doing homework or in my room skyping my bf. She was also gone a lot so I didnt think much of it. Eventually she started texting my other friends saying I was being weird and ignoring her. My one friend told me this and I didn't know what to say but didn't want to put that friend in an awkward situation by letting my roommate know she snitched. My friend just told her to talk to me, so I waited. She never did. She would just consistently complain about me to my other friends. \n\nBy this point I dug my heels in and refused to confront her about it because she was the one mad so she should come to me about it. This lasted for a few months and she'd act normal around me but complain behind my back. During this time my bf and I broke up and a very good friend of mine died along with other family issues. I didn't have the mental energy to deal with her as it was the least of my worries at the time.\n\nShe eventually got more frustrated to my face and would stop cleaning, told me not to use her groceries which we had always shared including things like salt. And she started closing her bedroom door because she was convinced I was messing with her stuff (we would leave our doors open when we weren't home so the other would know and not lock the other out.) I then started dating a friend of mine, a girl. She'd stay over some nights cause I was real anxious to be home alone with my roommate. One night we were...... doing things because my roommates door was closed so we assumed she wasn't home. Well I got a furious text calling me all sorts of names saying how dare I keep her up with my noise. I told her I didnt even know she was home and was not at all doing it on purpose. At one point she invited me to dinner cause I assumed she wanted to finally talk but she just started complaining about how bad her life was. \n\nWe lived together for a few more months until she moved out early and we havent spoke since.\n\nSo, what was it that caused her to react in such an extreme way?\n\nTL;DR spent less time with my roommate and didnt tell her about my long distance bf and she started talking shit to my friends and the internet but never talked to me. AITA for not going to her?\n",

A couple of my other friends were a bit on the chubby side and would complain about it (including my friend Jen, who this post is about), but I was legitimately obese.\n\nA while back I got tired of feeling unattractive and having health problems. I started to try and lose weight. I've never tried to lose weight before, but so far it's going great and I recently dropped into having an overweight BMI rather than an obese BMI for the first time I can remember.\n\nI don't talk about my weight loss journey much in person, since I don't want to be annoying and I know I easily *could* be if given the chance. If people comment on my weight loss (tbf it's a big difference), I just say I'm working out more and trying to eat healthier and then I change the subject. But I'm really proud of how much I've accomplished so far, so I've admittedly posted a few things on social media.\n\nOne of the few things I posted was a before/after picture to celebrate me not being obese anymore. In the caption I said something about how glad I am that I started this journey, and a few things about how miserable I was in the before picture because I was always in pain and felt so unattractive, and how much better this has been for my health and my confidence. I only talked about my feelings towards my body, and I was very careful not to bring other people into it or make generalizations about other obese people because I know from firsthand experience how hurtful that is.\n\nSo I got some compliments and the usual \"you go, girl!\" from some of my friends, but then when I met up with my friend Jen she started talking about the post. Jen's had body image issues for a long time and always puts herself down. She's talked a lot before about wishing she was thin. Her problems got worse for a while a few months ago because her now ex-bf of two years cheated on her with a skinny girl and she took as a sign that she's not good enough. I'm including this because it's the part that makes me wonder the most if I'm an insensitive asshole for not thinking of how the post would make her feel.\n\nJen said the post made her feel worse about herself and asked if I could tone it down. She said it seems kind of arrogant of me to brag about how easy it has been for me to lose weight, and that my behavior on social media looks like I just want attention. She said me talking about how I didn't like my body before would make other people feel bad, and that I should try to be more compassionate. She told me to be careful that I don't turn into the same kind of person I used to hate. I didn't really know what to say so I thanked her and told her she'd given me a lot to think about and I would try to have more empathy moving forward. Kind of regretting it now?\n\nJen's the sweetest person ever, and it's killing me to know that my post hurt her. It's true that I like the feeling of people cheering me on and complimenting me on my weight loss, after a lifetime of being the fat girl who was always insulted and never taken seriously. But I've made four posts about my weight loss in seven months. That doesn't seem like a lot. I still want to keep posting my accomplishments. Part of me is saying that it's my accomplishment and if I want to brag about it on social media, a place where everyone brags about everything, it's not my fault if someone takes it too personally. But at the same time I feel guilty, especially given Jen's history. AITA?",

She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up.

One of the motives behind me wanting to breakup is to show her that not all relationships end in emotional trauma. That being said, I also firmly believe that I won't be able to function in a long distance relationship. I am a relatively closed off person and if things work out, I'll be in a new city in a new country in about 6 months, so the starting weeks of college are gonna be difficult enough as it is.   \n\n\nAnd plus, one more reason is that, it's not like we're coming back. I don't plan on coming back to my country to settle down, and I don't think she'll stay here for long either.

As such, I may not remember all the details. \n\nSo 2 years ago I was in the midst of running a Pathfinder campaign (think D&amp;D) that was going great. Good, fun group who showed up regularly and brought good personality to the table. During April, one of my players ended up missing game for 3 weeks straight due to her working on her Master's Thesis. I recognize that as an important, and legitimate reason for missing the game. \n\nThat being said, after the 3rd week, I told her that if she didn't start showing up to game in the coming weeks, I would not hold her spot in the game anymore. I only run 4-5 players at most and we had 5. Now, this was not a threat, nor was I kicking her out. It simply meant that if she didn't start coming regularly then I would give her spot to another player if one wanted to join and showed up regularly. I felt it was an imposition on me the GM to hold a spot for someone who wasn't showing up regularly. This situation was also made worse by some inter-player drama that occurred a month earlier, but that is irrelevant to this situation. \n\nNow, I admit in hindsight that I was a bit of a dick in the way I presented that to her, making it sound like an ultimatum. It wasn't, nor was it intended to be. While I could have handled the situation better, I feel my reasoning in the matter was sound. I wasn't trying to be rude or threatening, just informing her that after a certain point of missing the game that I felt I couldn't hold someone's spot. She eventually returned and all was great, but if you're going to be gone for a prolonged period, it's a bit of an imposition to refuse a new player for someone who isn't there.",

Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she’s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don’t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? ",

She was openly homophobic during this party and I don’t  like having hateful people in my life so I forgot about her for a while. \n\nI gave her a chance and started following her on social media after my bf and I bumped into F and her bf at a store. My bf said he missed his friend, so I thought if I tried to be her friend despite our differences, maybe they could reconnect. \n\nOne day she posts a job opening, so I message her to thank her for posting because I’m going to apply. I ended up getting the job, and thanked her for that as well.\n\nShe offers to carpool with me to our training, and the entire time she’s questioning me about my mental health, my religion, my politics, a lot. It made me really uncomfortable.\n\nTraining day passes, a few months go by,  and the invasive questions do not stop. I stop showing up early at this point because keeping my guard up was exhausting.\n\nOne day, I leave work and I get a text from F. She’s confused because she’s been friendly and we should be close by now.  I told her that I still feel like we’re getting to know each other and that when I’m at work, I am there to work. I set clear boundaries about her asking personal questions and to not force me into acting closer to her than I perceive us to be. \n\nA few more weeks go by and F starts treating me differently and even starts talking badly about me to our coworkers. I started panic attacking at work. \n\nI texted my boss to quit my job. She called me, and we were both kind of sobbing. My boss knows my mental health situation and felt awful about the anxiety, but we both agreed that the job was holding back any progress on my mental health and ended the working relationship as amicably as we could. \n\nI found out that F manipulated our boss to think that we were best friends. Our boss said she was sorry that our job ruined our strong friendship, and how awful that must be for what I’m going through. When I told her I barely knew F and that I was confused because F made things worse for me, she said that’s not what F had to say about our friendship. I was confused but left it at that. \n\nA week later, F texted me to ask what’s going on because she got me the job and had a right to know. I ignored it because the very last text in our convo was where I asked to her respect my boundaries. Ironic. \n\nThe next weekend, F texts MY BF asking him why I won’t tell her why I left. She even tried to manipulate him by using her bf. She said “he’d like to see you once this is over” \n\nOur bfs shouldn’t have to sacrifice their friendship because we don’t get along. I was done. \n\nI texted her saying I found her threat to my bf disrespectful, and if she respected me she would have listened to my boundaries the first time. I told her there’s a difference between getting to know me and manipulating me to think we’re close. All she said was “okay, understood” and then blocked my number. \n\nAITA?",

I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\n\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \n\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \n\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \n\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again. He looks at me and says “you know, whatever issues your mother and I are having with the parking spot, you don’t have to get into the middle of them”.\n\nSo now I’m furious. I tell him “I have no idea what you’re talking about! If you want me to move my car, just ask me to!” And he just walks away.\n\nSo I’ve decided I’m not moving the car unless he explicitly asks me to. It’s now apparent to me that my mom told me to park in the spot to piss off my dad. But honestly that’s none of my business and I had no idea when I parked in the spot. I just want to get my degree and move out, I have no interest in being involved in my parents marital drama.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving my car (even though it seems obvious my dad wants me to) because he won’t ask?",

Anyway I was reverse parking into a space when a car comes up out of nowhere allowing me no space to reverse park. I continue inching toward the car, backing up while not hitting the car. It comes to the point where I can’t back up more without hitting her car. I roll down the window and ask the woman driving the car to backup since there are no cars behind her. She doesn’t budge. I’m assuming she wants me to accidentally hit her car so she can get some money out of it, but I honestly don’t know. I put my car in park, and we’re at a standstill for a minute. Then I put my car in drive and drive up a little to get some space to keep backing up, barely hitting a parked car up ahead. I get the space needed to park, put the car in reverse and make it into the slot, almost hitting her car.\n\nI know she’s not obliged to back up, but seriously? There were no cars behind her and the both of us could’ve saved two minutes. The entire encounter made me angry but I’m just wondering if finding another place to park was the move here and whether I was the asshole here?",

We have plans to move to another state together and we are starting a life. I have never been one to tell a SO that they are not allowed to speak to an ex or not have a friendship with them. But this girl, let’s call her Manda, I just don’t like and she really fucked him over. \n\nShe has an 8 or maybe 9 year old daughter and according to him is a terrible mother, I guess while they were together he developed a strong bond with this little girl bc the mother wouldn’t do shit for her and he kinda just took the daddy role (even though this isn’t his kid). Recently I found out they (him and the little girl) still speak which i honestly at first though was nice. But upon reading these messages it’s mostly him and Manda talking, and most recently he told her something private about my life that I asked him not to share, his excuse was “well you’re a big part of my life and we talk about life”. \nThe child is awesome and they seem to have a solid bond, he even mails her gifts and made sure to send birthday wishes and cute things. \n\nHim and Manda dated a little over a year and he told me he stayed with her bc of the child and the fact that they had nowhere else to go. He moved to another state with her and claims he did it so he could set them up somewhere else and then leave. I guess while they were there among other trashy and hurtful things that she did, she took HIS tent to a festival and had sex with someone else in it (her now 2nd baby daddy) and he left and came back here. \n\nI see him sending her pictures of her he took, videos of her hooping, and photos of them with the child in recent messages which bothered me. He also tells her things like her new hair looks good or she’s cute in whatever Facebook picture. He keeps saying he only talks to her to maintain an okay relationship so she will let him still communicate with the kid. I feel as though she’s using this to her advantage and I don’t like the stories he’s told me about things she’s done to him, and recently I’ve asked him to stop speaking to her. \n\nApparently she is coming to the state for a visit and her excuse for adding our city to her trip is “to spend as much time with _____ as possible” the blank being his sister who I guess is still her friend. He tells me he’s going to see her (and the child) and he’s going to take the kid out for the day etc. I once again flipped and said no that’s not cool, bc I don’t believe it’s just going to be the kid. \n\nI only heard about this child a few months ago. They were together about a year (and he was in the kids life), I feel like I would have been aware of him and the kid’s relationship sooner if it was so significant. So am I the asshole for asking him to sever ties so we can move on with our lives together? Bc he’s got me feeling like I’m being irrational. \n",

I told her to let me know of a day that shes willing to take the train and meet up.

We all have girlfriends who come and go, but one girlfriend (M 19) lives with us permanently. The three of us guys pay rent out of pocket, while the girlfriend in particular (we’ll call her Amy) has a room on campus that she has never once slept in, and that room costs more than what she would pay to live here. She hardly ever visits her own room. \n\nAmy eats food that her roommate pays for, uses up utilities with us, uses our bathroom, etc etc. She doesn’t buy food. She doesn’t pay for anything, except for herself. This is typically fine, she can pay her own food and expenses. But she wastes money paying for a place on campus when it could make living at my apartment cheaper for both of my roommates and myself. Even she would pay less.\n\nThis is something I’ve never voiced to my roommate who dates her, because I know the girlfriends me and my other roommate bring over don’t pay rent either. The difference is they come temporarily and leave. Half the time they’re not here. And while they temporarily take up space and do the same things as Amy, they leave just as often to stay at where they live.\n\nAmy and her boyfriend knew prior to moving in that Amy would be staying with us full-time. She’s cool as a roommate, but she also takes up a lot of space, makes the place dirty, sits on our couch all day, uses our shower and bathroom constantly.\n\nMy parents wonder why I live with 4 people full time and three pay rent. It’s more of a burden for them when they help me in affording college, and it would make rent cheaper for the other three.\n\nThe main reason why Amy doesn’t pay rent, is because her parents don’t know she lives with a bunch of guys. Her, and her boyfriend, have no plan on telling her parents. I can understand, but her parents are also paying thousands every semester for a room she’s never slept in. Amy and her boyfriend would rather not approach the issue then pay less for where they’re living because their parents cover most of it. I pay out of pocket for where I live a lot of the time. It’s tougher for me, when I feel it’d be easier if she paid rent.\n\nI approached my roommate who dates Amy, and low-key asked that since he knew beforehand that Amy would be living with us full-time, why she didn’t pay rent this year. He maintained the fact that since there’s only 3 people on the lease, it shouldn’t affect me at all and it’s not my problem. If she didn’t exist it wouldn’t make a difference. \n\nIt’s a small apartment, and she’s constantly around. She takes up a lot of space. \n\nI don’t know, I’m really unsure if I’m in the wrong place even asking.\n\nAm I an asshole for pulling my roommate aside after several months this morning, and asking him why she doesn’t pay rent? \n\n",

Her parents are divorced and the older of the two brothers lived with his mom.(this is the brother in question) Because they didn't have a lot of money they road with us in the car and took a bus home at the end of the week. (We stayed a second week by ourselves for a honeymoon). \n\nHer mom talks about that trip all the time. she said it was one of the best trip she ever took in her whole life. she talks about how much she loved to go back there someday. \n\nso this year for Christmas we decided to surprise her with a suitcase and a letter saying basically that we were taking her back there this summer. Because my wife sister is older and married now they will be going also. \n\nA few days ago I find out that the brother somehow thinks that he was invited to and that he's going on vacation with us. My wife doesn't really care so long as he pays his own way. \n\nHere's the problem though. This brother is like the most socially inept person I've ever met. He never learn to be an adult and is just a complete embarrassment to be around in public. He has this really annoying need for constant attention. If people are talking about things that he doesn't know about or have any experience with, he will just start making stuff up. He makes up insanely unbelievable stories about things he's done or seen that anybody would know is not true. And when you're talkin about things he will try to correct you and tell you you're wrong and then make up lies to support it. \n\nEx: someone asked if Dr pepper is made by Coke or Pepsi. I explained the doctor pepper is its own company and not made by either. He chimes in that dr. Pepper is actually made by Coke but Coke keeps it a secret. I told him that's ridiculous. He tells me that his friend's dad is the CFO for Coca-Cola and told him that they make Dr pepper. \n\nIt causes a lot of stress in the group. He will start trying to cut me down and tell lies. I will call him on his lies and expose him. Then he will get mad and pout and everyone will get mad at me for being mean to him. \n\nso anyway I find out that he thinks he's going on this vacation. I told my wife no way. If he's going I'm not going. We have going on a week-long trip with him before and it was a nightmare. everyone was mad at me the whole time for arguing with him. They think I should just let it go and let him lie. \n\nPart of me realizes that since I'm the only one that has a problem with him, I should bow out. But my wife and I are the ones that planned this trip. This is our vacation spot that we go to every year on our anniversary. (Forgot to mention this trip would be on our anniversary). We have gone every year since we were married and I really don't want to have to skip it.",

            "input": "Hi y’all, just wanna get other people’s thoughts on this. I figured that if my mom wants her friend to go so badly, they should just plan their own trip, but let me explain. Sorry for the long read. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nThe Situation:\n\nBack when I graduated from high school, my mom’s graduation gift to me was “a ticket to the Philippines (redeemable at a future date).” This is in quotations because there was no actual ticket, rather it was a comment written in my grad card because 1) I had already told her that even though I wanted to go, I would be in school and didn’t know when I’d actually be able to go and 2) she couldn’t actually afford a ticket at the time. This becomes important later on (imo). \n \nThis past summer, I applied to medical school and was successful(!), so I’ll be starting this coming fall. That being said, I’ve been studying/working throughout college and after graduation to prep my application and save money to pay for aforementioned apps, so I’ve never really been able to take any vacations or trips. In this span of ~6 years, my mom has gone to the Philippines (without me, because I was in school) 3 times, each time for 3-4 weeks. \n\nSince I’ll start school in the fall, I’ve started to plan my last day at work, and when I’ll finally be taking my trip to the Philippines. I told my mom about this, and asked if she would come with me and if the offer for the free ticket was still on the table. She admitted that money was still tight (which didn’t surprise me because my dad is still unemployed), and that she probably wouldn’t be able to cover her ticket, let alone mine. I was fine with this though, since I’ve been working full time and have managed to start saving a bit (after finally paying off the ~$6k I spent of my own money to apply to med school in the first place). I really want my mom to come with me, because the first time I went to the PI was with her, and I’d like to be able to enjoy a trip with her again. My tagalog is also not the greatest, and even though I know enough to get by and some of my family members speak some english, things still get lost in translation. \n\nSince I want my mom to come with me, I crunched the numbers and figured I can afford to buy my mom’s ticket, so I offered to do so for her. This she happily accepted, and we started trying to plan out dates for the trip. The main point of this trip, at least, as I intended it, was to visit and spend time with family. It’s been almost 10 years since I’ve last gone, and my grandmother’s getting pretty up there in age. My mom knows this. \n\nAs we’re figuring out dates, my mom pulls out her phone, and calls her best friend, who we’ll call Marie. Cue her telling Marie about our upcoming trip, and telling her she should come with us. She spends a good half hour discussing logistics, places her friend can stay, and other touristy islands and places they could visit. Marie sounds excited for the trip and plans to come. \n\nAfter she hangs up, I ask my mom why she invited Marie, as I wanted it to be us two to visit family. Her response was basically “Marie has been wanting to come with me to the PI forever!!! We’re finally going, so of course she should come. I told her she could the next time I went.” \nOf course, I responded saying that I wanted it to be a family visit trip, not one where we’d go around to all the touristy places so she and her could take pics (this was what she was talking with her about). She basically brushed that aside and said “She’s been wanting to go for so long, so she has to come. Don’t be selfish.” As if I haven’t too??\n\nThis is really annoying me, since this isn’t at all what I intended it to be and I feel like the trip would be much different now if her best friend does come. I’m at the point where I almost want to not pay for my mom’s ticket anymore, because I wanted it to be a trip for me and her, not here and her friend. But of course, if I don’t pay, my mom won’t be coming with me and won’t be able to see her family. So, AITA here, and WIBTA if I did tell her I didn’t want to pay for her anymore?\n\nTL;DR: Mom invited her best friend on a trip to visit family that I was going to pay her way for and calls me selfish for not wanting the best friend to come because “she wants to go too.”\n",

A girl contacted me and confided that he had groomed her, and was flirting with underage girls so he could have sex with them the minute they became legal, then ditch them. This is a crime in my country. She sent printscreens that looked dodgy. I mentioned this to said former friend in an argument where I cut him off for stabbing me in the back. Didn't say I was going to make them public or anything like that and his response was to immediately block me. This made me suspicious but still not overwhelmingly convinced. Former friend then spent 3 months on a total smear campaign about me. Since I had blocked him on messenger (he blocked my entire fb profile as soon as he read my message saying I had seen dodgy stuff about the way he treats underage girls) and mails people I'm friends with , badmouthing me, taunting them etc. During this time, more girls came forward confirming he had done the same things to them when they were underage, and one even saying he had slept with an underager.\n\nThis was incredibly alarming so I brought police attention to it.  Police said I was right to call as this is a concern, and that they'll need to talk to the actual victims to move forward. I tell the girls this and they agree to do that. That marks the end of my involvement. Someone said former friend finds out a couple of hours later , and now everyone's calling me an asshole and posting statuses about me on FB, calling me a liar, accusing me of trying to ruin his life because I'm \"jealous\", mailing everyone I know calling me a liar. The girls' timelines all check out, and the former friend was always *extremely* questionable when it came to girls, so I'm on the fence. Especially after his reaction/the last 3 months. Even though I stated this when defending myself, people are now harassing me via inbox, messaging others etc. and saying I'm wrong for contacting the police and \"butting in and reporting stupid stuff over facebook\". The thing is if I didn't report it, and the allegations the girls were making were 100% true, then I would feel guilty like hell for not reporting it.\n\nPeople are asking for the printscreens, but if he's done this to me, I could only imagine what he would do to his alleged victims so I won't reveal names/reveal printscreens. AITA for reporting him to the police or should I have just stayed out of it? I feel like I did the right thing, but the amount of hate and ostracisation I'm getting is now making me second guess myself. I have severe depression and anxiety and the way people have consistently came at me today is making my mental state worse, even though my close friends have told me I was right to report.",

That's been a little frustrating but understandable. My real annoyance comes from that over the past couple weeks she's made 4 dates with me, and then bailed pretty close to the date each time. Excuses were pretty much always work related, and I definitely understand having to pick up a last minute shift, or having a really trying day and being too tired to go out. On the other hand I can't help but be unhappy with the situation. \n\nThat brings us to the current situation, I asked her last weekend when she would be free next because I'd like to see her. She responded that she was going to be getting off early on Wednesday and we should go out after. I agreed and planned on seeing her Wednesday night. Wednesday morning she texts me to ask if we're still going out, I confirm and we agree I'll pick her up from work. \n\nLater on in the day she texts me to say she still wants to go out, but she's gotta be home by 10:30. I was a little disappointed because she often doesn't get off until 9:00 or so, but it had been a couple weeks since I'd seen her so I agreed and told her to let me know when she would be off. She assured me again it would be early because Wednesdays are slow. \n\n9:00pm rolls around and I haven't heard from her, so I text to ask if she is still stuck at work. No response. \n\nToday, she finally texted me back over 24 hours later. The text just said \"I lost my phone 💀💀💀.\" I sort of doubt the truthfulness of that, but even if it were true I kinda feel like there's any number of ways she could have cancelled on me. Besides surely bailing on a fifth date in a row, this time with no contact, should warrant some kind of apology. \n\nAnyway I haven't texted her back, and I kind of don't plan to.

I’ve said I think it looks good, but Whilst I haven’t outright said it, I’ve tried to hint I’d prefer the other one (which I’d like to add is cheaper than the game friendo was talking about).\n\nTo round it up, friendo ended up getting me the second game, and whilst I’m grateful for the thought, I’m finding myself disappointed that they got me it instead of the other game I’ve been hinting at for weeks, I haven’t shown this at all to them, and I fully intend to give the game a go, I just wanted a second (or however many people) opinion on if I’m an asshole for being disappointed, and if I’d be the asshole if I kept hinting about the other game after a little while?\n\nApologies for the long post, TLDR:\nFriend who I’ve been hinting at wanting a certain game for a while got me another game of the same genre(?).

I always make her write down the passwords that she comes up with and she always forgets them. Most recently she decided to get a new phone and switched from the easy to use iPhone platform that she has been using for years to Android and she's pissed that \"My Spotify isn't on here, and they told me it would transfer.\" Spotify WAS on her phone, she's just too stupid to realize she needs to sign into it and as we all know history likes to repeat itself so of course, she doesn't know the username or password.\n\nMy other Aunt can't remember her email password. Doesn't have access to the recovery email and doesn't know her secret questions. Yet I'm the jerk for not wanting to help her sort it out.\n  \nThey always love to say \"But you helped me set up the password\" when I tell them I don't remember it. I don't know in what world a person is expected to keep track of someone else's passwords but I don't live in it, I've got enough passwords of my own to keep track of, not to mention the fact that I watched them write it down last time we reset it. \n\nI love my Dad but how many times can I show him how to switch his Chrome default search engine back to Google before I lose my shit and just stop helping? \n\nIt feels like the only time my family calls me is if they have a question about their computer or phone, and I can't stand it. I work on an IT helpdesk all day talking to idiots. I wish they would just recognize that I don't want to sit and answer IT questions and fix issues that wouldn't be issues if they would just fucking listen.\n\nThis Thanksgiving within 5 minutes of me arriving I'm being asked to look at problems with 3 peoples phones and fix my Dad's web browser again for the 10th time this year.

            "input": "Well, where to start? I haven't talked with my mother regularly in two years and I think it took me a lot to get to that point. I guess I'll split this up by major events?\n\n2 years ago, pre-wedding:\n\nThere was a large family event, small-family (less than 20 with cousins and aunts) but the event was big enough to get most of them together, my mother was not explicitly invited.\n\nMy mother was not invited because the person getting married and she had not on spoken in years. It was decided that she would be allowed to act as a plus-one to any member that wanted to take her and basically everyone offered. My mom took to this as being a huge sign of disrespect, not getting an explicit invitation, and chose not to come. Eventually asking me not to participate either. I chose to go because I hadn't seen some of these cousins in years.\n\nThe out-of-town family was staying the weekend so I asked if we wanted to go to a theme park. Everyone ended up thinking it was a great idea. I invited my mom but then my aunt decided to go and my mom blew up. Also choosing not to go to that either. She had made it about herself, as if the theme park visit was about family getting to see her. At this point, I guess she decided she was having an argument with her sister.\n\nSo, I was casually asked to not go. I think a week or two before my mom tried to make plans for the weekend of the wedding to which I think I initially agreed. I think it was spring break maybe summer, I'm at uni hence the title. Once I realized the dates I made it clear I couldn't hang out with her. I think this is when I thought of going to the park and invited her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 years ago, post-wedding:\n\nMost of the family hung out excluding my mother. She chose not to come. I even pleaded for her to participate and it was a constant will she won't she. By the end of it, right as I was driving home, I think she sent a several \"page\" text (it's not really pages on iPhone anymore but you get the point?) maybe saying sorry but it quickly broke down into an argument. When arguing with her it's just so stressful trying to get all these things across and never getting a chance so I got to the point of finally saying alright express all you grievances so I can get my turn. It ended with her saying this aunt raped her with a water hose before I was born. She had never mentioned this and I don't really understand how this was relevant to the situation. It felt manipulative and I couldn't really process anything at all anymore so I told her she needed to leave me alone. \n\nI blocked her from my phone and that's really the only way to get a hold of me. She has my main email address and I never let it get out of control but shes never emailed. I could no longer handle the instability and unpredictability of her meltdowns. I think I had recently told her that and then like a day later a meltdown happened. It was like she was pretending not to hear me and would specifically do what I told her stressed me out.\n\nFast forward 1 year ago:\n\nThere was another wedding and literally, everyone was invited. I hadn't talked to my mother since the last one. I didn't sit with her at the ceremony or the after thing (the dance/ eating/ party thing after the church. I get confused on the terms, sorry.). I got pretty drunk and I think I started talking to her about my 17 years younger half-brother. He's basically illiterate and now aged in the double digits. I think she left shortly after? I know another aunt came over and tried to reconcile differences at some point. Deciding she would mediate but I think she had chosen to fight for my mom so not true meditation.  I know I got way drunk I can't remember much? I don't think I talked to my mom during this time through text.\n\nWithin a week:\n\nI've been doing great! I was constantly a nervous wreck most of my life. I always had terrible acne but I've been getting good sleep and eating well. My face is clear, I make great grades, and I'm making friends.\n\nI play Fortnite with my little brother and he has expressed that he planned on going to graduation. I texted my mother at the start of this semester, my senior year, to start coordinating plans for graduation. Earlier last week I texted her and asked if it would be okay to call, she agreed. The phone call went well. She was acting very nervous at first but I can't really guess why. She was like almost expecting a certain thing but sounded generally happy. I think she thought I was calling because I was like dying or something? I ended up having to hang up because of a quick emergency. So, I texted her back 5 minutes later and said it was good talking to you and said sorry for just springing up out of nowhere to talk. She responded with a massive text talking about how much I hurt her and that she'll remember these things \"until the day I die\" saying she left the most recent wedding early because of me. I accepted fault and said I was pretty drunk. Then it was just text after text of her resaying all the same stuff and not really listening to what I had to say. Similar to the last time we texted and maybe as it has always been?\n\nI recently read a book, the laws of human nature, and I have been considering peoples backgrounds when how they act. I have learned to understand my mother's behavior and I was trying to forgive her. I don't want to act the way she acts. This book explains it is very likely I will fall into the same habits if I don't stay conscious about it. I don't know why I reached out, I guess it's my mom. I want to be able to have a stable relationship.  \n\nAnyway, I asked my mom if it would be okay if I visit over the current winter break. She started sending all the texts about how disrespectful I was and that there need to be rules I have to accept if I'm to see my little brother. Honestly, it has been two years and she had acted cool in the texts earlier this semester about coming to graduation. Well, I didn't like the tone of the conversation so I said we would go back to not talking. She started being whishy-washy and tried to make it sound like it was her idea to not talk? Idk it sounds petty but I think it is relevant to say it was my choice.\n\nPrevious 24 hours:\n\nShe is obviously pissed and was talking about years of grief. When I expressed one thing specifically that she constantly makes me feel bad about she acted as if she was never mad about that and made it seem like it was actually me who was mad over this event 14 years in the past. She graduated from college and moved me into my dads while she lived with the aunt I mentioned earlier. I decided to stay with my dad once she got an apartment and shes always told me how it hurt her and never accepts an apology for it. I mentioned this grievance and she made it seem like she was never mad about me staying with my dad and that she thought I was the one mad this whole time. Like what do I even have to be mad about that I stayed living with my dad?\n\nI decided to uninvite her to my graduation. It is way too much stress. She hasn't helped me with the price of a cheeseburger since I started. She never really makes me feel good about myself. I just don't want to talk to her at all anymore. I've started a new book about surviving psychological abuse and she is a textbook abuser. \\*cue I can see clearly now\\*. \n\nI texted her and I think I'll just copy paste? me: Well, I put a lot of thought into it. I don’t want you at my graduation. I’m no longer interested in maintaining a relationship. You had a lot of terrible things to say and if I ever try to explain how you make me feel you minimize or ignore it maybe you say I have the wrong memory all-together. Anyway, I don’t wanna deal with it anymore. I was really trying to be nice when I reached out, you’re very angry. I think you project a lot so I feel like I sound like you when I’m trying to explain what you do but that’s for you to figure out! Bye I guess \n\nHer: You know what Erick, I’m done with you son. You’ve been so disrespectful and shitty towards me since you were about 11. You’ve got issues, and you need to grow up! I’m a good mom and was a “great” mom to you. You totally don’t deserve me. Thank God I have \\[little bro\\] because if all I had as a reference as a mom and you were my only child I’d probably have shot myself. Don’t contact me again.\n\nSo, grand-finale, my mother just told me she would have killed herself if I was her only son and that I've been terrible since I was 11? Who gets mad at an 11-year-old. She has a social work degree, I would think they tell you it is never the child's fault?\n\nI think I'm better off. I think she's being manipulative and knows full well what she does.\n\nTL;DR  First, I think you need to read it all, I know I needed to write it! Haven't talked to my mom in 2 years. She hasn't talked with most of her family in as long or much much longer. I told her she is not invited to my college graduation and that I don't want to talk to her anymore. She said she would have killed herself if I was her only son and to not contact her anymore.\n\nJust here for the judgment. AMIA?",

She told me that she doesn't have the mental energy to talk to anyone, but was able to go out of town with someone for a day trip. But I guess certain people calm other people down and I am still trying to understand the different versions of social anxiety because day in and day out it's different. \n\nThe last message that was sent was that I told her a simple message that she wasn't feeling well would've been enough and she just ended the conversation with \"okay\".

My gf has a big bottle of shampoo for women. She has a long hair so she uses quite a lot of it. So when I started using the new shampoo my gf just casually asked before going to shower if she could use it. I thought for a while and said no. Maybe I was tired of sharing everything and wanted to have something, even small, of my own. Besides my family got it as a present for me, and I was afraid my gf would use 1/3 of the small bottle on her hair.\n\nShe got angry and stormed out of the room. She spend the next hour sulking locked in a room and when I tried to ask why she's mad she just said she feels uncomfortable if there's something I don't want to share with her and she doesn't want to talk with me.\n\nShould I just share literally everything, even gifts for me, with my gf or is it normal to want to have some personal items of your own in a relationship?\n\nTL;DR: Didn't share my gift-shampoo with my gf because I want to have something of my own, she got mad and will be uncomfortable if I don't share everything.",

Hair accumulates on the machine washer's door and i figured that the filter might need a little bit of cleaning. I am living with my best friend in a rented apparent with one more guy. My friend and the other guy lived here before me and in my place lived a girl which I replaced. When i tried cleaning the filter, it got stuck because there were hair clips from the girl in the filter that jammed in between the filter and the washer, essentially getting the filter stuck. I couldn't put it in fully, i couldn't take it out.   \n\n\nThis is where the problem arises. My best friend (we've known each other since kindergarten, now we are 21-22) came in the kitchen and saw me fiddling with the filter and i told him it got stuck for unknown reasons ( at the time ). When he found out, he suddenly started blaming me and shaming me - \"Why don't you ask ME for \\*permission\\* to do things? Why do you do things on your own mind? Why do you think you can do everything on your own? Why do you think you can REPAIR the washing machine by yourself? Why do you think you know everything and can \\*fix\\* things on your own? Why do you constantly brake things that are none of your business? Why do you think you are a mechanic and feel the need to fiddle around? YOU BROKE THE WASHING MACHINE, I DON'T CARE, I WANT IT FIXED! Take responsibility for once in your life, you broke it and STOP complaining!\". Now, keep in mind that i haven't really fiddled with anything up to that point in that apt. I did tell him that its not my fault that it got stuck and i told him the reason why it happened, i followed the manual and i only wanted to clean out the filter which is something normal to do with a washing machine in my mind. I would've paid for repairs \\*if needed\\*, the thing was in warranty too, hell, i would've paid for the darn whole washing machine too.  \n\n\nSo am I the asshole? I only tried cleaning out the filter and it jammed for reasons beyond me.. I fixed the issue by myself and he didn't offer any help. Am i the asshole for \\*breaking\\* the washer and \\*complaining\\* that it is not my fault that this happened ( though i held responsibility to fix it ), or is my friend the asshole for shouting at me and pointing fingers at me and blaming me for absolutely everything possible? I asked my father and he said i am in the wrong since I got the filter stuck and I shouldn't be offended by my friend's reaction.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She said (after nobody responded to her), \"I guess you all hate me. I'm just going to leave then.\" I texted to ask if she was ok, but she wouldnt tell me what was wrong. She had also been talking about everyone in the group behind our backs. \n\nThe next day, my friend tried to come up to me in school and pretend like nothing had happened. I ignored her, and she yelled after me.\n\nThat day she asked someone to add her back to our group chat, and they did. She starts by saying \"I'm sorry I suck guys. I didnt mean to hurt your feelings. I love you.\" Nobody responded. I thought this was a little manipulative tbh.\n\nShe texts me and asks if she can explain. I say sure. She said she wasn't mad at us, but dealing with her own issues. I said fine. Whatever. I told her it sounded like a guilt trip to make us feel bad. Especially since she talked about how much we all hate her. She says she wanted someone to ask if she was ok because we should care about her. I tell her I DID ask if she was ok. She ignores that.\n\nShe then says that I attacked her by ignoring her? I said that that was playing the victim card. She yelled at me. I say that I would have offered help if she told me what was wrong, and she says that I \"attacked her for needing help.\" We go back and forth for a little while, until she goes onto the group chat that she was added back into.\n\nShe says, \"I know I said sorry before, but you guys are clearly still upset.\"\n\nI respond (in the group chat), \"I know I said sorry before, but you guys are clearly still upset = Its ridiculous that you guys are upset\"\n\nI called her out for manipulation. I said that she was trying to make our issues seem ridiculous and is trying to get us to apologize to her. She was the one talking about us and ignoring us. It's not fair for her to act like it's our fault for not forgiving her yet. \n\nShe calls me a crappy friend and a \"jerk.\" I call her the same. She says its ridiculous that I keep saying that she's manipulative, and I say that that's what it sounds like. I also add that others think so too. (It is actually true, multiple people told me they agreed.)\n\nA second friend and I kick her out of the group chat again. (We use a messaging app and you can do that). \n\nNow, about a week later, she texts someone in the group and asks to be added back into the chat. She says that it's not fair that I am keeping her away from her friends, but it wasn't just me. Anyone could add her back, but nobody has.\n\nI've told our group that I'm not interested in letting myself be walked all over, and people seem to agree. I want to cut her off from the group, but her best friend is in the group too and isn't so sure. So, AITA for wanting to cut her off or did she actually do nothing wrong?",

Obviously it wasn’t me looking at this, and it left me pretty shook. \nI’ve known my fiancé likes milf porn and such, but I had no idea he was into THIS. We have 2 two year old girls, so the thought that he has been getting off to stuff like this is really unsettling.\nWhen he got home from work, he could tell something was off with me so I straight up told him that I saw it. He was embarrassed, of course, and kept saying that he “isn’t into it personally,” but I am just having a hard time letting this settle and I keep thinking about it. I haven’t let him change our daughters diapers or left him alone with them at all, which may be an overreaction, but I don’t care. AITA for calling him out, and not being able to deal with this?\n\nEdit to clarify: first off, I am not against porn. I don’t disagree with it or ban my fiancé from watching it, I just don’t personally watch it myself so I don’t understand the appeal. Secondly, I was trying to be very general with my post, but to be more specific by “incest porn” I meant he literally left his reddit up and he is active in multiple incest subreddits. And lastly, I don’t think it was a crazy jump for me to be concerned for my children, because invest is quite literally having sex with your family and my daughters are our family. I have never been concerned about him with our children before, but with this random discovery I deemed it necessary to be that over protective mother for my sweet girls, whether it hurt his feelings or not.

Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I’m scrolling and I’m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think “oh cool” and click on it. Still reeling from £1 night at the club I didn’t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised “wait that’s my girlfriend”. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn’t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn’t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn’t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn’t then I didn’t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn’t want to stop so I ended things then and there.

I moved out of my parents house to be on my own last year, so it's all very new to me. I'm not assertive at all and I have trouble establishing boundaries. \n\nI became friends with one of my neighbors and she's disabled (she weighs 500+ pounds and cannot walk/stand for long periods of time or drive). I would ask if she needed anything from the store if I saw her and I was already going. Huge mistake. She then started asking me for favors constantly; asking me to pick up her groceries or can I drive her to doctor's appointment. I have very small car and not to be mean, but she would simply not fit. She is very inconsiderate and quite selfish and basically sucks people dry and annoys people until they stop doing her favors. \n\nNow, all that being said, I don't believe she is doing this maliciously. She's had a rough childhood and her mother never taught her how to be a functioning adult. She is heavily dependent on other people. I have come to her with problems of my own. I adopted a puppy and it was very stressful and she's helped me with researching training and she's talked to me when I'm feeling sad/anxiety. \n\nI work full time and on my days off, I like to do nothing but play video games, do laundry, and be lazy in my nightgown. She calls me and leaves me a voicemail to stop being so antisocial and to come down for coffee in the lobby. I tell her that I'm not ready and I don't feel like socializing at the moment. She accepts it and we agree to talk later. \n\nI wind up taking a nap and I get woken up by her calling and I said, hey i'm sleeping can I call you back when I wake up more? she said that's fine, but I'm going to come up there (to my apartment) if you don't call me back in the next 15 minutes. And I'm half asleep and I'm just like yeah don't do that, i'm gonna fall back asleep. \n\n20 minutes later, I hear pounding on my door and i'm like oh, it's probably maintenance and I get my robe on and it's her standing at my door. I hate when people drop by unannounced. Unless it's family or super close friends, I don't want anyone just coming by because I don't feel like talking to the person. \n\nShe said \"I figured you would ignore your phone if I called so I decided to just come up\" and I'm just standing there like wtf? and she just walks right into my apartment and plops down on my couch. And I'm grumpy but I'm drinking coffee so I'm waking up. She tells me about more dog training shit and I'm just like, I've figured out a training solution that works well with both me and my dog. She still makes me take down all this information. \n\nThank god my little pup has to go outside to potty, it's been about 30 minutes that she's been in my apartment. So we leave my apartment  and she says she'll meet me in the lobby when I come back in and i'm just thinking *I do not give a solitary fuck actually*. I let my pup do her business and come back inside. \n\nI notice she has a wallet that looks very similar to mine and I ask her that I have one just like that. And she tells me that she found it on the ground and the ID says **my full name**. And I'm not trying to jump to conclusions so I ask if I dropped it on my way out of the elevator? \n\nShe says no she got it from my purse. And i'm like wtf? you went through my purse? She said that she wanted her food stamps card back because I got a couple things for her the day before at the grocery store. And I tell her \"Why didn't you just ask for it back, it's not even in my wallet, it's in a pocket in my purse.\" \n\nShe just laughs it off and says I love messing with you and I make an excuse to leave and go back to my apartment. I double check to make sure nothing was taken from my wallet but she just wanted to do a \"harmless prank\". \n\nShe called me that same night and I told her I need her to respect my boundaries and not to come over unannounced anymore because it stresses me out to have uninvited guests. She said that she just wants to be close friends with me and didn't really see the problem. Am I the asshole here? I don't want her in my space but she also justifies herself by saying she is just trying to make friends.  ",

Specifically my pet comet goldfish. How I got her is important to the story, as I didn't go out and buy a goldfish that, for those of you who don't know, grow to be quite a large size. Instead, I got her through my zoology class. One of our first labs involved fish and when the lab was over, there were about 30 goldfish in need of re-homing. I wasn't going to get one, I really wasn't...but then I did, which I fully admit was an impulse decision as I hadn't done my research first. Long story short, a single comet goldfish requires a tank size of at least 55 gallons for when they're full size. Campus rules say you can't have an aquarium larger than 10 gallons, so I currently have her in that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did my research after getting her and I'm taking as good of care of her as I can.

The fish and fish care are incredibly stress relieving for me, even the tank cleaning is relaxing. There are days when I come home from a long day of classes and stare at her swimming around for hours to unwind myself. This is where I find myself asking the question, \"am I an asshole?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know she will need a bigger aquarium soon. She has plenty of room right now because she's a baby, but she'll grow. Many people on the fish subreddits say to re-home your goldfish if you can't provide the perfect home for them, either to someone else or to a local fish store. However, I do not know anyone who lives off campus who would take a goldfish, and I refuse to leave her at home for my family to take care of, both because I know they won't do as good a job as I do with the cleaning, and because it's not fair to dump that responsibility on them. There is no local fish store where I live, and I have no car to travel to somewhere that does. Even if I did have a store to give her to, she's a 40 cent goldfish, not an exotic fish. They most likely wouldn't take her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, she's a rescue fish who's getting a better life than she normally would have seeing as she was a disposable \"lab rat\" fish who would have died otherwise. I really enjoy having her and I plan on buying a 55 gallon as soon as I have my own place, and if she were to die before that, I would not replace her since I now know I can't house one correctly here. That being said, I still want an unbiased opinion from people who aren't me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't the typical AITA post, and I hope I don't come across as fishing for attention (pun intended). I just want an objective view on my situation/choices.",

            "input": "A few years ago I lived with this girl that had a rescue dog that she had adopted a few years before. The dog was super sweet and super clingy and loved humans. Sadly she did not have a lot of time for him, so she never walked him, saying that he was too old, which I think is complete BS. He only went out in the small backyard to do his business. He spent all his day in the living room waiting for someone to come home and play with him. He also had a lot of energy and was not properly trained, which led to him chomping on everything he could reach. We were advised when we moved into the house that he does this, so I did my best to always keep food out of the dog's reach. He still got into some of my friend's chocolate one time and had to go to the vet. \n\nNow, one thing that bothered me about living with this girl was the fact that she was not very tidy or clean. It was an awkward situation, since the house belonged to the girl's father and was already stuffed with the girl's and her boyfriend's belongings. They owned a lot of toys from TV shows and such and generally their stuff was just everywhere, while I barely ever had a place to put my laptop. \n\nOne time after christmas, I wanted to sit at the dining table to eat and discovered that it was covered in stuff, some of them wrapped presents. I decided to put the presents on one of the chairs, so I could eat at the table. Later in the day, the dog's owner calls me downstairs to inform me that the dog had gotten into the presents and eaten a scented candle and that this was a gift from her parents to her boyfriend's parents and that the candle had to be replaced...by me. Not only did she want me to pay for the candle, which is still annoying enough but whatever, but she wanted me to personally go out right then and shop for the candle, as it had to be there the next day. I was honestly shocked that she wanted me to go buy this candle. For one, she did not know what was in the presents, so she did not put a note on it saying that it might be something edible. Also, I did not feel that it was my responsibilty to replace an item that her dog ate and it is not like she replaced my friend's chocolate when the dog jumped on the counter and ate those and I would've never asked her to because it's ridiculous. Ultimately, I only had two more months living with them though, so I did go shopping for the candle, which of course was a christmas-scented candle and was now out of stock. I bought a similar candle, which the housemate said she couldn't use and offered me to keep it. How generous.\n\nSo AITA for initially not wanting to replace the candle and still feeling annoyed at this girl for this? I wouldn't have done it, but my parents convinced me to just try and keep the peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my housemate's dog ate a candle that I had moved from a table to a chair and my housemate wanted me to shop for the exact candle and when I bought a similiar one from the same brand didn't want it.

            "input": "A little background, after my freshman year my good friend and I decided we were fed up with dorms and made plans to move into an on campus apartment for our sophomore year.  We were the first ones to put our names down for the apartment and up until mid summer we were the only ones listed in the apartment.  Well room assignments came around and two random roommates were also assigned to the apartment.  This was no big deal and was something we both saw coming as it was pretty unrealistic to get an apartment all to ourselves.\n\nAnyway, after moving into the apartment Saturday morning things were strange.  I didn't see my first random roommate (we'll call him Mat) until nine at night since he was staying in his room with the door closed.  My second random roommate (let's call him Tim) didn't move in until late Sunday night and made quite a commotion doing so.  The next morning, I saw Mat in the kitchen and we introduced ourselves.  The basics like what our major was, our year, where we're from, etc. in general he's a pretty decent guy and I don't have any problems with him.\n\nTim on the other hand...\n\nI didn't see Tim until Wednesday night when I was in the kitchen waiting for water to boil.  He came up the stairs and I said something along the lines of \"hey how's it going\" and he walked right past me.  No wave.  No eye contact.  Nothing.  He walked straight past me and into his room.  Off to a great start.\n\nI saw him again the next day and tried to start a conversation.  I managed to get a small wave out of him as he passed by but that was it.  \n\nThis continued on for weeks until Mat, my friend, and I had to almost drag him out of his room to fill out our roommate agreement.  During this ,we all agreed to keep the apartment clean, take out the trash as it fills, and just generally be respectful of one another.  Well the three of us did, Tim did little more than sit there quietly.\n\nTo no ones surprise Tim didn't keep up his end of things.  He has a popcorn maker and there are constantly kernels left all over the floor and the trash can will overflow with his microwave meal packages.  On top of all of this Tim gets really into his video games.  And I mean **REALLY** into them.  He stays up late swearing his head off and dropping every racial slur under the sun at these games.\n\nSome of my favorite quotes of his include (if you're easily offended don't click the spoilers)\n\n\"&gt;!Get raped you fucking nigger!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!I can barely understand you go back to your own country spic!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!Don't talk to me you fucking dipshit!&lt;\"\n\nand the list continues\n\nThis finally prompted the three of us to talk to our RA and have a mediation to try and get things worked out with him.  The mediation wasn't very productive but Tim told us he'd do better.\n\nShockingly nothing changed.  Food was still being left on the floor.  He was still stuffing his trash into an already filled trashcan rather than taking it out.  And his choices in language and volume level didn't change.\n\nAbout a month later we go to the housing office to attempt to get something done.  The housing office organizes a SECOND mediation with our RA and our housing coordinator.  This mediation went a bit better and a chore chart was organized to make sure everything gets done.\n\nThings have been relatively stagnant since then, he still yells at his video games but the apartment stays clean.  There's still almost no communication and trying to talk to him feels like cornering a wild animal.  \n\nWell last week I came out of the bathroom to see Tim standing there waiting for me.  He said something along the lines of \"hey... would you and \\[friend's name\\] want to get pizza sometime?\" I told him I'd have to talk to my friend but maybe.\n\nI have no intention of getting pizza with this guy.  He's ignored every attempt at communication and friendship for months now and has been outright disrespectful at times.  I appreciate him finally reaching out but for me it's too late.  So am I the asshole for not wanting to be friends with my roommate after months of him blatantly disrespecting and ignoring me?\n\nTL:DR One of my four college roommates has refused to talk to anyone in the apartment for months now.  He's disrespectful, messy, and yells racial slurs at his video games and is just not the kind of person I want to associate with.  He finally asked my friend and I if we'd want to grab food sometime but I feel like it's too little too late after living together for four months and having no communication.\n\nAlso thank you to anyone who read this novel of a post, this is me trying to summarize four months of hell.  I didn't even include his 7' green inflatable dinosaur, his latex sex suit, or his $300 dragon sex mask.",

We share a studio apartment in the city for which the rent is incredibly reasonable and I was ok with this because getting her debt free was a priority. \n\nSuddenly without income on her end I’m paying for groceries and if she remains unemployed past this payment I’m on the hook for her loans since I co-signed them when she refinanced.

I completely get that applying for jobs is a full time job but right now I’m doing a full time job + commuting + house chores + taking care of her while I don’t see her making any progress and I’m feeling taken advantage of.  \n\nAm I wrong to ask her to pull her weight? Especially if I’m going to have to cover her student loans next month? ",

I mention that because maybe my behavior makes a bit more sense in context, but then again maybe not. Anyway: \n\nYesterday I was on a semi-crowded subway car headed back from work. Standing up, headphones in, as is my custom. It's a decently long commute and the whole time there's a youngish couple (guy and girl, mid-twenties) across the way from me, having what seems to be an increasingly heated argument. They're not speaking English but the guy in question is clearly upset, and appears to be the more aggrieved party. I mostly mind my own business. At some point, though, he gets to the point where he's full-on screaming at her. Very public freakout. To the level that a couple jokers actually have their phones out and are filming it and others are sort of hooting and laughing. \n\nNow, the guy's not big but his body language is more than a bit aggressive, and I notice that the lady is actually starting to cry. Soooo... in what I think is an unobtrusive manner, I sidle up to the guy and say, *\"Hey dude, take it easy OK?\"* \n\nI don't touch him or anything, but predictably he shifts the full brunt of his anger to me and starts cussing me out, telling me to mind my own fucking business bitch, etc etc. Maybe not being a dude saved me from a full-on ass-kicking, but who knows. I didn't really try to defend myself, apart from continually telling him to calm down. It's difficult to read the vibe in the car at that point, but I can readily tell that nobody has my back in this. \n\nI get a teensy bit of satisfaction when he exits at the next stop (his apparent girlfriend goes and sits in the far corner), but mostly I immediately feel like a raging douche. Several people give me a sort of eye-rolly dismissive look that indicates they agree. One helpful gentleman politely tells me that doing that kind of thing is a bad move and I really should mind my own business, especially when it's between a couple like that. \n\nSo at present I feel like way less of a good samaritan and way more of a busy-body asshole. I also don't know why I felt the need to step in in that instance when I know I'll be obliged to ignore all kinds of equally disturbing behavior on public transport in the future. As I said, I'm still getting the hang of the vibe here. D'you think IWTA there? ",

I bought it and got a confirmation email that they had gotten my order.\n    2 weeks later I was wondering why it hadn’t shipped. I emailed them and they told me they ran out of stock and weren’t going to get any more. They said I could instead get a different ball for the price I paid. So they offered me a 60$(already less than I paid)ball for what I paid(which was of lesser quality). I then asked if I could have a refund instead. \n    Another 2 weeks later and no refund. I email back in and ask if they can just give me another ball of equivalent quality(Another ball that cost 165$) they said no but they can offer me a ball from last year (165$ at full retail price/on there website, but usually around 80-100$ on other sites) for 25% off. Some quick math would reveal that they were offering 41$ off after I had already paid 71$.\n   I was getting fed up at this point and emailed a new person from customer service. They refunded the ball, and said for my trouble they would sign me up for the rewards program (10$ but gives you a lot of discounts from their website) for free. I had to email in one more time after this because the person then forgot to add me to the rewards program. But in the end I did get my refund and was added to the rewards program for free.

            "input": "\n\nI’d been waiting for years to have a cat again, and adopted an older one that needed to be rehomed.  I did not realize the cat was as old as she was when I took her and her age quickly started to show. She only moves to eat and use litter box.  The rest of the time she rests in one spot.  That’s it.  Very sweet cat but she’s like a living fixture in my house. \n\nWhen I was first dating SO, one of the earlier important questions I asked was if he was ok with cats, if we/I could have a cat down the road if we live together.  He said yes.  He said yes because we were newly in love and we were enamored with each other and I badly wanted a cat and although he’s an anti-cat guy he said OK.  I already had a cat, but I know she is old- I’m asking about another cat. \n\nAnd after a couple of years cat discussions came up and he changed his position on cats. He hates cats, he’s allergic (even though I’ve never seen him have an allergic reaction when he’s over at my place with my cat), says cats are horrible and murderous, they kill for sport, cats stink, litter box stinks, they don’t love their people etc etc etc.   And he took back his agreement to have a cat.   He now says NO CATS when we live together. \n\nThe subject of moving in together has come up  and we have been looking at places and without any particular rush are planning on living together, that’s the long term plan. \n\nNext thing I know, my teenager comes home with a kitten.  Now- I didn’t go LOOKING for this kitty. Neither did my teenager who just found it, it was dumped and starving.  So we fed the kitten, knowing we couldn’t keep it but just helping until I can get it to a rescue for her forever home.  I didn’t mention it to SO because we had other things going on and it was temporary anyway.  In hindsight- probably should’ve mentioned it.   ..... SO comes over and learns there is a kitten here.   I tell him the cat is not staying (even though of course I do want to keep her) I’m going to send her to rescue.  He says “No No No No- I know you want that cat your kids are in love with that cat it’s already been here and you guys are attached to the cat. So absolutely DO NOT get rid of that cat because you will be making me the bad guy and no thank you to that. The kids will know it was me who spoiled it and made you get rid of the cat.”  He was piiiiiiissed.  But told me not to get rid of the cat. \n\nSoooooo I kept the cat.   But he couldn’t sleep and was so upset because he took this as a HUGE sign that I don’t want to live with him since he said he wouldn’t live with a cat and now here’s cat that will be around for a long time. When this came up in an argument a month or so later, and I reminded him that he told me to keep the cat that he did not want to be the bad guy or make my kids upset that they had to part with the kitten.  He told me I should’ve known better and that I was supposed to go ahead and not keep the kitty of my own accord, not because he told me to.\n\nGreat when he tells me this NOW, after we are all really and truly attached to the cat and after the cat is very attached to us.  She loves and trusts us very much.   I’m reluctant to even try and rehome her now. This is her home. And I love her. I know I should’ve discussed this with SO more as it’s a big decision that affects us both in the event we live together.  And I do want to live together. I just want him to accept a cat like he said he would.  It’s JUST a cat. Its not a sign that I don’t love SO or want to live together. \n\nNow SO is so mad. He doesn’t want to come over. He’s pissed all the time about me getting a cat.  It’s almost getting worse.  The more he thinks about it, the more upset he is and it’s snowballing into a huge thing.  Also he flat out said he will NEVER EVER EVER live with a cat.  He wants to live with me 100%.  This is not him looking for an excuse not to live together. He does.  Just not with my cat.  \n\nHonestly ..... I love this cat. I really do. It’s important to me.  So important that it was one of the few questions I ask in the beginning of a relationship. Dealbreaker questions.  And for me a cat is one of those questions.  \n\nI understand how he feels.  ***He feels like I chose this cat over him. Over his feelings. Over our relationship.  And he’s very very butthurt.***\n\nBut it’s JUST A CAT.  I get it. He doesn’t like cats.  I wish he would get over it and do this for me.  He wishes I would get rid of the cat for him.   I told him, it’s fine you don’t have to live with a cat.  He said Neither do you.  \n\nI think he should accept the cat because it means so much to me.  Just deal with it it’s not the worst thing in the world. He thinks I don’t care about his feelings and that I should not have a cat because it means so much to him. \n \nAITA?\n\n",

Ex and I both had depression and anxiety at some point (I had pretty bad post natal depression both times and while I'd love to say he was super supportive and caring, he really wasn't.). He was incredibly difficult to live with, has a lot of autistic traits I didn't see in the beginning. I tried to involve him in caring for the kids, attending their appointments, but he had no patience with them and I often had to step in to avoid a meltdown. He did nothing to help keep the house in order, inside or out, despite both of us working and me pleading for help. Both of our children have autism and I believe he does as well. In the end I couldn't take any more, I'd begun to resent him because I felt unheard and unappreciated, more like his mother and maid than his wife or partner. I'm not perfect, I know he felt like I was too controlling and I'll admit that I probably was.

I lied about little and big things, stole food and clothing, cheated on people and in school, manipulated others for my own gain, abused drugs and alcohol, was very promiscuous, and all around did not give a fuck about anyone other than myself and my 3 sisters. I was desperate to be loved but not trusting enough to ever give anyone the opportunity, so in order to protect myself and keep my options open because since that’s all I ever learned how to do, I was rarely faithful in my relationships. I was also a bitch about a lot of things but was still pretty submissive and doting in other ways, so I’m sure it was a confusing whirlwind for anyone I was involved with. All in all, I wasn’t the best person, let alone friend or girlfriend. \n\nI feel incredibly guilty about who I was back then and what I did to others. I have worked very hard in my adult life to never be that person again through lots of intensive therapy, medication, getting an education, and choosing to be better and do good each day. I can never take back the hurt I caused others but I have centered my life around making up for my transgressions through other means. I own and operate a non-profit that houses and fully sponsors homeless teens and young adults who have aged out of the system to receive counseling and work towards their future goals, whether that be college or entering the work force. This information is probably meaningless for the purpose of this but I feel as if it’s important to know that my behavior was circumstantial and it is not who I am.  \n\nMy ex and I still talk, we grew up together so he knows my situation, and I have apologized profusely to him over the years. He calls me up crying about once or twice every single year to tell me how I’ve ruined his ability to trust and love others and how hurt he still is. Sometimes he hits me up and is very flirtatious and tries to spark things up again (I always turn these advances down). Other times, if I’m dating someone and he knows who they are, he will antagonize them, insult them, and has, on occasion, gotten physical with them. I never severed ties with him because I always felt like he was justified in his treatment towards me and his resulting behavior because of how I wronged him, because I thought he was amazing and I felt like I was beneath him, and I felt so guilty for messing up such a good thing with a good guy that part of me hoped we’d get back together. \n\nRecently, about a few weeks ago, we were catching up and he started bragging to me about all these things he’s doing (he is very accomplished, has his PhD and has won a lot of awards, and is such an upstanding, good person, he adopted his cousin’s twin boys because the cousin is strung out on heroin, so he kind of deserves to brag and be complimented for all he’s done) but I thought it was strange because we hadn’t spoken in length for years. Then he started bragging about how he hadn’t dated anyone since we had been together, something he does often, even though this is a lie as I know at least three people he has seen and two he has been “official” with. He again blamed me for his unwillingness and inability to get involved with others and started saying straight up bullshit about the times we were together (saying we dated at a different time than we did by several years, saying we were never official and only talked for one month, etc). Then he started coming on to me, demanded I start sending him nudes regularly, and that we be fuck buddies. \n\nAt this point, I just lost it. I started yelling about how he can’t change the facts of things just because he doesn’t like how they turned out, how rude it is of him to always try to use me for sex (something he has admitted to in the past), that it’s not fair he pops back into my life to punish me every few months and that I was done with it, that I had always felt sorry about how I treated him before now but that I wasn’t sorry anymore because he’s acting creepy and pathetic, that it had been over 10 years since all this happened and he should have been over it by now and that not dating anyone in your twenties doesn’t make you some saint like he’s always painting himself out to be, I told him he needs to stop blaming me for his intimacy issues and stop using me to make himself feel good, that he is being ridiculous and that even though he thinks I’m the horrible person it’s really him, and that he needed professional help. I did say I wish I had never hurt him or anyone else but that I was a teenager, raising myself and living in constant fear, and that no one should be judged based off of who they were as teenagers and that he of all people should know that (he also did some very messed up things as a teenager which I won’t elaborate on as it’s not pertinent to this). \n\nHe got really pissed off and started cussing me out and saying that I was a good for nothing whore and that I would never be anything more, that everyone knew what a slut I was and that that no one actually liked me, that I can’t call him out on acting like a shitty person because I am the actual truly shitty person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or loved, that I was an idiot, that he wasn’t immature but that I was for raising my voice and always using slang words (I work with teenagers, it rubs off, what can I say), that I would never be as accomplished him and would never amount to anything, and that he was the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me. \n\nI rolled my eyes and laughed at him and get kind of snarky and told him I don’t owe him anything, that it was gracious of me to apologize as much as I had but that I didn’t have to but did because I wanted him to know it was me and not him, and that even if I did owe him something it most certainly wouldn’t be my body and that he’s raising his cousin’s boys badly if he believes that. \n\nHe said that since I just put out for everyone and since he’s already seen it all then I shouldn’t be such a bitch about us hooking up or sending him nudes and that it’s offensive to him that I’m shutting him down. \n\nI hold him that the only reason he was mad was because I was supposedly a whore but that I wouldn’t be a whore for him. \n\nHe stormed off after this and then blocked me on all social media a few minutes later. We haven’t talked or seen each other since. \n\nI don’t really feel bad about cheating on him anymore or about how he’s dealt with that (I still know it was wrong). My opinion of him has completely flipped from placing him on a pedestal to thinking lower of him and believing he’s just an egotistical jerk who’s got everyone else fooled (we’re from a small town and he’s very popular here, everyone loves him and thinks he is literally the world’s greatest person, and everyone he meets outside of our town think the same thing). \n\nA couple days after we fought, I started to feel like I am actually in the wrong for being mad at him, fussing at him, and for having stopped feeling bad, and for starting to feel kind of repulsed by him. I know that everything impacts each person differently and I don’t want to invalidate his feelings or belittle them and I know that everyone moves on or doesn’t at their own pace and own prerogative and it’s not my position to say how or when someone does or doesn’t do this. I know that even though I might have seen our relationship as silly and was not really invested in it or him, he may have been very committed and in love and I could have crushed him, so just because I feel one way doesn’t mean he will feel the same way, and I can’t project that into him. \n\nBut truth be told, and to be quite blunt about it, I truly just feel like he’s being a little bitch about it and that he has now wronged me so we’re even somehow. \n\nI don’t really know how to feel about how I’m feeling and keep switching between feeling like I crossed the line and will never be in the right when it comes to him because of our history OR feeling relieved, vindicated, and very appalled at and vexed by him. \n\nI’m just here looking for some unbiased clarification as of course my friends support my side of it just as I’m sure his friends support his. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?

She's 18 and I'm 20, this weekend we are home with the two of us and she decided to throw a party yesterday.\n\nI went out to a buddy of mine for a smoke sesh and came back around 11 P.M. M was having a girls night and she invited 5 people. I have seen all her friends a few times and I would consider myself to be good friends with M. I greeted everyone and went to my room as to not disturb them further. Was feeling pretty good already but decided to roll myself a blunt and took my bong out for a few bowls throughout the night. \n\nAround 12 the munchies kicked in and I went downstairs to grab some snacks. They saw me in the kitchen and it was obvious they were already pretty drunk. I got dared to take 4 shots back to back and they started teasing me and calling me a pussy for not doing it. Now I was already pretty high but decided to to do it because why not. M asked me if I had some green and I gave them my bong and took a few hits with them. Left the bong downstairs for them to use and went up with my snacks and rolled another blunt. \n\nI was just puffing and watching YouTube in my bed when someone opened my door. It was M and her friend S. They were laughing their asses off and they both jumped on my bed. I was roughly a [9] at this point and was not sure what to do. I asked them how they were doing and all they did was giggle, touch and tease me. They were both in lingerie too. Somebody called M and she left my room but S was still laying down on my bed. Usually she's pretty shy but a real sweetheart nonetheless. That was not the case now and she was barraging me with questions and kept eying me. \n\nLong story short, we shared the blunt I had left and went to watch some Netflix. This eventually escalated and we ended up having sex and falling asleep afterwards. I don't even know if we used protection.\n\nThis morning I was woken up by M who angrily told me to 'wake the fuck up'. She told me she couldn't believe I had slept with her friend and called me disgusting. I tried to apologize but she was having none of it and stormed out of my room. She hasn't talked to me since and acts like I don't exist. I have a bunch of messages from S thanking me for the night and that she loved it but she had to tell M and that she's sorry.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Honestly if I was fully sober I would have never done this but I was not in control. I definitely understand where she's coming from but I don't believe I'm entirely in the wrong here.\n",

We were supposed to have 6+ free throws but were somehow negated by the refs because you cant argue against them or else you get a technical foul. Close fight. We lost.\n\nYeah, I was mad obviously. So I decided to post on twitter. I said \" my teacher probably hired some construction workers and gave them referee clothes fuck you refs\". Thought I was being creative and all instead of just saying something simple like \"refs dumb\" etc. \n\nWent to bed and the next thing I knew was my PE teacher wanted to talk to me. I knew it was about the tweet but why the teacher instead of the ref? I got called into the office and we talked. Apparently the principal saw it and she hates profanity. Who the fuck thinks profanity is taboo? The teacher's ass is getting chewed on by the higher ups because of my mistake. My tweet is also a violation of \"disrespect\" based on the student handbook. Dont know how that was disrespect but I lost one medal because of it. I asked on what the refs were thinking at that time etc. and they just kept defending them saying \"You want me to cancel next year's games?\" \"They are licensed\" \"They dont see everything\" \"We paid a lot\" etc. And they just kept talking about how we should be more respectful and respect the refs because they are licensed and experienced. I dont care if they were licensed or not but they disrespected my game, I \"disrespected\" them. But as a student, I am powerless against people with misuse of power, even if i'm right.\n\nI kinda guess my roast was too good intead of just saying \" dumb ref lol\"\n\nTLDR: Tweeted against ref, pricipal got mad, suspended\n\n",

One friend, \"Mitch\", somehow got very drunk during the concert (we were all drinking, but he was especially drunk at the end) and suggested we go back to his place to play some Jackbox Games. \n\nI expressed hesitation because I had a feeling that if he was this drunk, it meant that he would pass out early. He insisted that he was fine. We talked about getting food before leaving but everyone said they weren't hungry. Eventually, I agreed to go to Mitch's place with my husband, \"Caleb\", and the other guy, \"Rob\". I hailed a cab off the street and then we went to Mitch's place in Queens. Tip + fare is \\~$24. \n\nWe get there and Mitch is alternately smoking (on his balcony) or talking about making Vietnamese noodles. He gives Caleb and I a beer... to split. I'm frustrated so I tell him we came there to play games so sit his ass down and stop talking about noodles. We play approximately two games before he falls asleep on the couch. \n\nCaleb, Rob, and I play another game while Mitch is asleep but they're really much better with four people so we head back to our respective places via Lyft. \n\nThe next day, I get a text (on the group text with Mitch, Caleb, and Rob) from Mitch asking everyone to each pay him $6 for the cab to his place. I sent a text back, \"No, that's part of being the after party host\".  A couple hours later, I get a request from Venmo for $6 (as did Caleb). I send another text explaining that I wasn't kidding, I'm not paying and that if we had gone back to our place, we would've paid for the cab. This dissolves into an \"epic\" text fight where neither of us are understanding how the other doesn't get that they're being ridiculous. My main argument is that he is asking to pay $6 to get home, while Caleb and I would pay a total of $26 to get home ($12 for the cab to Mitch's plus $14 for the Lyft). His argument is basically we split the cab, so we should split the fare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Additional info that may be relevant:**\n\n* We are all well paid professionals - with Mitch making the second highest single salary out of the four of us (so it's not about needing the money).\n* We regularly host people at our place, and buy all the beer/wine and snacks. We don't ask for reimbursement. \n* Mitch also hosts, but is generally less likely to have beer to share.\n* From Mitch, Rob lives slightly less than a mile away and Caleb and I live about 2 miles in the other direction.\n* I was convinced that I was not the asshole here, but we recently met up with Mitch for the first time after this fight and he (and Rob) expressed total confusion that I thought I was in the right. We're no longer fighting but I wanted to make this post to see once and for all who is in the right. I will accept the outcome either way, and will show the post to Mitch as well. \n* We never paid him the $12\n* I asked my husband to chime in on the text battle and he responded dryly \"It seems like you've got it handled\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "This happened last weekend but she's still not talking to me so I decided to bring it here for judgment instead.\n\nMy GF and I (both late 20s) have been together for about a year and a half. When I met her she was financially stable, though I make mid-six figures and she makes mid-five figures. I appreciated that she was frugal (as am I) and didn't waste money on things like trips or expensive meals out or material items no one needs. After a while she admitted to me that the reason she is so frugal is because she grew up very poor and does not have a safety net. Last spring she had an accident that resulted in her being in the hospital for some time and saddled her with a great deal of medical bills. From day one she was adamant that because we had only been dating for a few months, I was not responsible for any of her bills, nor did she even want me to know the financial specifics of them. I was fine with that and we continued as usual. I did notice that she has become more frugal than before and has acted as if she is under more stress, but I honestly thought it had more to do with the accident than anything else.\n\nLast weekend we met up with two of our other friends for brunch. My GF said she wasn't hungry and didn't order anything during the meal and just had a cappuccino and some of my home fries, but we all split the meal four ways anyway because that's how it is with these friends. It wasn't a huge bill but she was obviously annoyed about having to put her card down for it, even though we've all paid our share of meals where we had the smallest item before. Anyway, when we were on our way home we passed a woman selling tamales on the corner for $2 apiece. GF says to me \"Babe, do you have $2?\" I did have cash, but she had literally just sat through a meal saying she wasn't hungry, and I was embarrassed by the way she had rolled her eyes while settling the bill, so I told her there was a bank across the street. She went \"I don't want to have to take out a $20 just for a two dollar tamale,\" and I told her \"Fine, don't get a tamale then.\" She got really quiet and went \"I'm just really hungry,\" and I kind of snapped at her and told her that she should have ordered something at brunch instead of just eating my leftovers. Then she told me that she has been \"food insecure\" over the past few weeks because of her medical/credit card debt and that she didn't have the $20 in her bank account to take out because she had to pay at brunch. She said she hadn't told me about any of this because she \"knew\" I would judge her for not handling her money more wisely, started crying, called me an asshole, and walked off. I haven't spoken to her since it happened on Sunday.\n\nI don't think this is fair for a number of reasons, the biggest being that I'm not a mind reader and wouldn't know anything about her finances because she expressly told me her medical bills were none of my business. I highly doubt the \"food insecure\" claim, but either way, she has been way too eager to let me pick up the bill when we go out to eat over the past couple months (even though at the beginning of the relationship we always split it evenly, or she'd pay if she ordered the more expensive thing). She makes a salary and I have no reason to believe she can't afford food to eat, so I'm pretty sure this is a guilt trip situation. But like I said, she hasn't spoken to me since Sunday and it's Thursday morning, so I am looking for an objective opinion: am I the asshole for not giving her tamale money, or does she need to realize that she can't keep mooching off people just because she's in debt?",

The last straw for me was finding out that during that month he'd begun relentlessly flirting with other girls on social media, whether they were interested or not, and was taking another girl on dates near identical to our first dates, all while burying any posts of me under his woodworking and not telling any of them I existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, as for why I wrote it all out; any other time we'd fought, he would yell and throw things I'd end up so exhausted from the flashbacks and panic it caused, he'd have a panic attack and I'd drop everything to take care of him even though he never stopped yelling or physically intimidating things, and I'd give up. The next day he'd promise he'd try to do better, and make me laugh and smile even though nothing had been solved. I didn't want to give in without having fixed anything this time so I wrote out the points I wanted to make on my phone and read them off my phone. I wanted him to realize everything that he'd done.

We've fought twice since the breakup and every time he says something like \"why don't you send me the essay you wrote about me being a terrible person and I'll go over it with my therapist\". (I know I shouldn't have kept talking to him, but I really wanted to help him get better).

            "input": "Hubby and I moved across the country to help my mom with my grandparents (shopping, doctor visits, etc). My grandmother has alzheimer's and it's still in the beginning stages, which makes dealing with her a little difficult. She's in her late 70s and refuses to be told how to live, even if it's good for her health. Because of insurance changed, we have had to change their doctor a couple of times. Her last three doctors have told her that she's diabetic, but she refuses to believe it and continually sites the doctor before them saying she's \"borderline\" only. She's actually gotten into full blown arguments with my grandfather, my mother, and myself about the fact that she has to take her medication as prescribed and the fact that her diet absolutely has to change in order to keep her healthy. I have even gone so far as to threaten her with a home (not that I could ever follow through with the threat, I was just grasping at straws). My grandfather is and has been ready to be put in a home for over a decade because he does not want to become a burden to anyone. My grandmother, on the other hand, refused to talk to me for almost two weeks just for mentioning it. Then, about eight months ago, a friend of my grandmother's moved back into town (she had been living with her son and hated it). She's on the list for section 8 housing, but jumped the gun and moved into my grandparents' house. From what my grandfather was told, she would be there two weeks, she was there three months and only left because she had to (my uncle was coming into town and my grandfather told her that they needed the space). She still takes my grandmother out all the time, and while they are out she borrows money from my grandmother with no real repayment plan in place. She also comes over a few times a week to eat dinner, completely uninvited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in the mix of all that (about three months ago), my grandmother started calling on her friend to take her to the doctor. I would show up to take her to appointments only to find out that she was already gone. Or I would find out, after the fact, about her going to an appointment that I didn't even know about. This is especially problematic because her friend doesn't tell us what's happening and my grandmother doesn't remember everything or just refuses to tell us about her appointments. When my mother confronted my grandparents about it, they responded by saying that I'm unreliable. Which blows my mind because until this started happening, I was always the one taking them to their appointments without fail, and I am still the one that takes my grandfather to all of his appointments. Of course, asking them how I can be considered unreliable when I don't even know about the appointment gets met with silence. So, we've officially told my grandmother that she is no longer allowed to go to the doctor without me or my mother, on at least four separate times now. I even went so far as to call her friend and tell her that she cannot take my grandmother to any appointments. Like, I don't even care if you take her shopping or whatever. That's between you and her, but no more doctors. That's my job. That was two weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week, my grandmother had outpatient surgery. Her friend went with us because my grandmother had no idea where she was supposed to go and I wasn't involved in any of the planning for this surgery. There was a mass removed, which had to be sent to pathology. I set up the appointment for the results. I also set up an appointment for my grandfather's dermatologist later on the same day. That day is Monday. I woke up sick as a dog on Friday, but I have been forcing medication down my throat to get myself well enough over the weekend to not have to ask my mom to take time off work for this. Well, midday on Friday, grandma's friend calls me.  \n\n\nFriend: Hey \\[my name\\]. I heard you had to go to the Social Security Office on Monday?\n\nMe: No...?\n\nFriend: Oh, well, your grandmother's appointment is on Monday. At what time?\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: So that I can go.\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: \\*mumbles\\* Okay. Okay. Talk to you later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother comes home later on, from being with my grandparents. She caught my grandma attempting to make plans with her friend for Monday. Her excuse is that I'm sick and I won't be able to take her. I'm at the point where I want to call her friend and reiterate that she is not to take my grandmother to the doctors anymore. Am I being unreasonable here?",

I don't post to facebook and I don't need validation from people online.\n\nShe talked to her friend and her friend, who gets upset when her on/off boyfriend adds girls to facebook all the time, chimed in that I'm immature and she should dump me if I don't \"Claim\" her on facebook. I think this is petty. I explained I spend 4-6 days a week with her, our kids hang out, we crash at each others places all the time, we go on road trips, we're planning a trip to Europe this summer. It's not like I'm hiding anything and I don't want/need validation from people. I don't show off, I don't brag, it's just how it's always been with me. I don't even post pics of places I go. The important people in my life know, I've sent them pics of us together and that's it.\n\nHer son can't get off snapchat and constantly lies and advertises that he's drinking underage and using drugs (another story, it's being worked out). I just don't like putting my life on display.\n\nI said I'm not changing my mind on this, facebook doesn't define my relationships and if she wants to end it over somthing as petty as this, then go for it.

Making things much easier and providing us a good base to continue life together.\n\nThis year we've both been under heavy stress. Myself, I've been aggresively job hunting after graduation  for over 6 months with very little hope and just getting more and more depressed after each rejection. My ex-gf was facing stress from a grandfather who's been terminally ill for a year, with also lots of assignments keeping her busy at university.\n\nDuring our time together we've both known about each other's issues, but not how great the stress is for each of us. I was blind by her schedule, so I structured my tasks around her, so I could spend time with her hanging out, going out, going for walks n talks etc. In some cases, she did bring up her grandfather, and every time I'd listen and talk about it. However I never sugar coated it. I tried to voice my stress. Telling her directly, about rejections or how stressed out I am. But at this point she seemed go be already annoyed at me for reasons I couldn't understand, she would often play mobile games and not communicate properly with me, which was not like her.\n\nIt was 2-3 months after her arrival when she broke up with me before xmas holidays, stating the reasons being me and my family. For hurting her feelings, and not supporting her at all. She said that she would sit in my bathroom and cry in secret and go to a friends house to sleepover there instead. She also stated very petty reasons that I'm a bad boyfriend, in most cases a lie or an exageration. Her crying state made me fall for it and sympathise with her. She also revealed to me \"dark secrets\" that she has never told me about. She said she was suicidal since 12 years old and that before me she cheated horribly with her ex, threatening me that she would do the same to me if we went on for longer, she never spoke to me about any of these things, not even hinting.\n\nA lot of her issues, seem to stem from a time before I've known her. Yet in her final dialogue with me, placed the blame on myself. I haven't been in contact with her since and only known of her progress through mutual friends. Fixing out she seemed to have recovered, posting unusually Instagram posts with hastags of #happiness #positivity etc. Rather superficial in my opinion. I also found out that after returning to uni after holidays, she immediately went on a date with a friend she met there. So it's clear she moved on very quickly.\n\nI've left this relationship feeling incredibly guilty and sorry for her, as it really was an amazing relationship. We treated each other, and she admitted this, yet she didn't speak to me about any of these feelings she said she had. Seemed like she built up all the negatives and just burst by the end. I also feel very angry and resentful, as I feel I was betrayed. Opening my house to her, settling her in to a new city, keeping her busy with what time we had. I had my stress, and she had hers. I tried to talk about it, but she shut herself off. Am I really a bad partner, and a monster that she sees me as ?\n\nIronically, I acquired a great job a week after we broke up, with many benefits, prospects etc. So it's rather oddly timed, as a part of my life continues and another runs off. Certainly missed details, but it would get rather wordy and messy.",

We had planned in on Tuesday of last week (Election Day), and I bought all the tickets then. Everyone paid me and what not things are all good. A little more context: I'm on the quarter system at my university, so this week is pre finals week/finals week and the week after is finals week. So Sunday arrives, game is at 6pm. We all kind of preemptively set 4:45-5:00pm as the departure time. 4o'clock rolls around and one of my friends texts us saying he isn't feeling well and has a lot of HW so he sold the ticket to one of our mutual friends; nbd because I like the guy and he's pretty chill. I come downstairs (we all live in this \"house\" on campus thats for like 30 people so kind of frat style but it isn't a frat) at 430, after finishing up studying to ask the other two how soon they want to depart. They both then look at each other and say sorry they don't want to go, they have a lot of homework.\n\nAt this moment I just become pissed because this is literal last minute cancelling and I essentially bitch at them. They say its not personal and that they just have homework to do and that they just don't feel like it. Plus, \"its finals week, cmon man\". This is all in the commons room and a bit extra people are there, like 1-3 who aren't involved, and I essentially tell them that they are giving me a big fuck you by cancelling last minute. I kind of go on to abscond them for a minute about how this is just bs leaving me because you couldn't get your shit together. My rationale is that not only was this planned Tuesday, but we all know our workload in advance so its not a shock like there was a lot of work this week. Secondly, we were all watching football downstairs that day, but I left for three and a half hours to do homework in leu of going to the game. And now I'm being called a child by my roommate (was one of the ppl that was going) and that I'm overreacting to something that wasn't personal.\n\nI understand that it isn't personal, but I'm still upset about it because they are my friends and they couldn't go because they couldn't plan ahead. \n\nI talked to my dad about this and he says that people just do this, that people look out for their own self interests and that cancelling plans last minute happens all the time. So AITA for calling out two of my friends?\n\nAlso just for closure sake: I went with the first guy, and invite two other dudes in the house I wasn't friends with particularly, but just wanted to not waste the tickets.",

My siblings there even call me a \"ghost brother\" which kinda hurt me to hear. Meanwhile every time I ask to meet up halfway (they have a car, and don't work weekends...) I'm told to just take the train down and see them. I just think of it as a two way street and if they're not making any effort, why should I? \n\nThis is a big deal for me even though it may not seem significant because I have anxiety and I'm already stressed out enough about putting myself through school.

Apparently I scrolled up a bit too far because I found that shortly before we went on this trip, he had taken several close-up shots of his ex's ass in tight sweatpants as she was laying on the ground playing with the 4 year old daughter they have together (he sees his daughter and ex about 4-5 times week as they have shared custody). \n\nWhen I confronted him about the photos and told him how much it hurt me to find out that he would look at another woman that way and would go as far as to take pictures of her body even though he is in a committed relationship with me, he barely acknowledged my feelings. When I asked him why he did it, he said it was \"hard to let go\" of his ex (she was the one who left him).\n\nHe basically showed no remorse about the photos, and said it doesn't mean anything so he has nothing to apologize for. I know they have a history together, and he promised me that the only reason he sees his ex is because they have shared custody of their daughter.

It really makes me wonder what else he does behind my back.\n\nAITA for getting upset at these photos?

My bf is kinda the typical frat bro and honestly nothing from the outset screams anything but heterosexual, so when we started dating I assumed he was straight.\n\n About 6 months in he mentioned that he had a \"bate buddy\" in college, so I replied \"oh who was she? Did you date\" and he just laughed was like \"it's not a she\". I'm bi myself so it wasn't a big deal at all to me, but I definitely was shocked so I told him I didn't know he was bi, to which he laughed and said he was \"100% straight\" and it was \"just a guy thing\". I obviously thought it was an odd excuse but I grew up with all girls so I don't know much about guys so I just left it alone.\n\n\nSo shortly after that we were having sexy times and he wanted me to describe my past romps with woman, so I ask him about his past \"bate buddies\" and he gets really quiet and admits that sometimes they went further than just masturbating beside each other and goes on to tell me that he's done just about anything you could think of with another guy a couple times. So I made a lighthearted joke about it; something along the lines of \"should I be worried another guy is going to take you away from me\". He didn't get mad but I could see he was a bit upset by it and just kept saying that he's straight and he was just experimenting but he doesn't have any interest in guys. \n\nSo today I ask to use his phone to quickly buy something online because mine broke so when I opened it I'm greeted by gay porn. He snatched it out of my hand and laughs but was obviously embarassed I say to him that they're is nothing wrong with being bisexual and I don't care if he watches that type of porn. He just kinda blows up and insists he's not bisexual and that he's tired of me trying to say he is. I really really tried to explain to him there is nothing wrong with it and I'm nit trying to but labels on him but I think he should just accept it if he's okay. But he just got even angrier ans stormed out.\n\nI feel super bad about it but I honestly just want him to be comfortable with who he is. I used to deny I was bi so it's a bit personal to me. I also think that the reason he won't admit it is because his dad left his family for another man so I think it might be some internal hostility (even through they have a very good relationship now)\n\n\n\n",

I was in a bad situation where myself and my two cats were about to become homeless. \nSo me and my boyfriend (we can call him bob) were only really dating for about a month. We got along fairly well but obviously there's only so much you can do with someone long distance. Anyways, when I told him about my situation, he offered to fly me to him, with my cats and I could stay in his second bedroom (or with him in his bed if I decided). He was going to pay for plane ticket, pet deposit fees, etc. Until I could get back on my feet financially and such. He even said he'd fly me back home if so desired. \nI didn't really want to accept such a big offer like that, especially since I hadn't been with him for very long.. but I was put in a position where it really was my best option. So I accepted.\nMy first week there, things were weird. He would not have sex with me, or anything intimate. I tried to sleep in his bed but every day he'd say that it felt like I was pushing him away. So much so, he felt I was doing it in my sleep. (Creating physical barriers between us using a blanket?) \nA few more weeks go by, I still haven't been able to find a job in the small town I moved to. Therefore I haven't been able to help pay for anything, but he did know this beforehand. After 2 months, I finally get a part time serving job. I make enough to pay half the bills but not reimburse him for what he's already paid.. and he reassured me he doesn't want me to pay him back. He also had put me on the lease, too.\n After starting my new job and spending time away from him, I realized how much we didn't get along. We could not communicate in a productive way at all. When I started to show a lack of interest, he immediately assumed I was cheating. He began to go through messages of mine if I left them open on my computer. \nI finally decided I wanted it to be over because nothing about this was healthy or normal for a relationship, but I didn't have anywhere else to go so I thought maybe I could stay. I wanted to be friends with him since he did so much for me but i also didnt want to be pressured to stay in a relationship. I wanted to stay in the second bedroom, continue to pay half rent. At least until I could save and afford my own place. He told me that if I didn't want to date him, then I had to move out. I was disappointed but obliged. Started to look for a new place, staying in the second bedroom (Where I had nothing but a twinsize blow up mattress and about 80% of the room filled with Bob's boxes). Since I was single and so ready for this relationship to be over, especially after 3 months of no sex, I was flirting with a guy at work via texts. Bob found a friend to help him hack into all of my accounts and cell phone number so that he could read all of my messages. He showed up to my work multiple times to yell at me in front of customers to \"get my shit and get out\". I had to have my manager escort him out because he would not leave. He simultaneously changed the locks on the front door so I couldn't get in. He would call his mom over to babysit me whenever I was home alone so I didn't \"steal anything\". When I finally moved out (onto a work friends couch) he refuses to give me the rent money I paid for THIS month, and is telling me to repay him for everything he spent before...\n\ntldr; long distance boyfriend pays for my plane ticket to live with him while I'm broke and homeless, when relationship doesn't work out, he hacks into my accounts and messages, changes locks on door, and accuses me of lying and cheating and kicks me out even though I am on lease and pay half the bills.

As I'm the only one with a car and one of them was pregnant (let's call her M) I suggested to come pick them up and drive them to the city where we would have dinner. And so I did. \n\nAs M did have a way of previously not offering to split parking fees when I drove us home (or any other costs) so I asked her the night before if she was willing to contribute if the parking fee was higher than the cost of public transport would have been. Which seemed fair to me and she agreed. Little backstory, I'm the only one with a part-time job now and need my weekend days also to run arrends and clean my house. From 13:00 on she was texting me about different parking lots, their costs per hour and the number of cars they could hold. I didn't really look into her suggestions because I was busy and just went to pick them up. They got into my car and at that point we didn't make a decision on the parking lot and I didn't really acknowledge all of her research on parking lots. I did ask what parking lot she would like me to go to and she came up with a whole cons and pro's list. I told her that I'd prefer the closest as I liked the convienence. She continues to discuss options and at that point I'm a bit done with it and try to shut it down with a joke along the lines of ''I would almost think you have never parked a car before, I've never seen so much research go into costs and places of parking lots!'' And she loses it. Screaming that I should shut up and that I'm ridiculing her and that not everyone earns as much money as I do. \n\nI immediatly apoligized for my comment (hardly could get a word in) and drove to the parking lot closest to the restaurant. We did sort of talk it out later that night and she blamed it on pregancy hormones. I drove her home later that night and that was the last time we really spoke. After that she texted me that she realized that it wasn't her hormones and that I put her down with that joke and made her feel small by saying something like that. \n\nSo the friendship has ended but it made me kind of insecure about it.

At one point, I didn’t get back to her for a whole day because a string of family emergencies (a family friend passed away, my parents house almost burned down and my sister went into labour all in the space of about 24 hours), and when I finally checked my phone, I found a really ragey text saying she didn’t understand what she had done wrong and that she would delete my number and never text me again. I told her what had happened and she said she obviously hasn’t deleted my number,  then took this as an invitation to repeatedly text me again.\n\nI know her husband died a few years ago and she’s in her 60’s so she’s probably super lonely but I’ve not text her since, aita?",

We've had our good times and bad times and in the beginning we both just got out of bad relationships and both made mistakes of misloyalty, i wont go further into detail, but this comes in later..\n\nIn the beginning we lived in different towns, i lived at home, we would see eachother as much as possible, this died down a little after highschool and when we got jobs. But we still hung out whenever we were free. No problems with no replies on texts. Then more recently in the past couple months, ive been noticing when i tell her good night and i love you, which i just thought was a nice thing to say and help someones night go well.\n\nHowever, my texts seemed to be maybe 3 to 4 lines, and hers would be 2 to 1 lines. But now she hasnt really texted me back more than once since i last saw her a couple days ago. I wont see her for about a week now,\n\n and ive had past relationships and earlier issues with cheating and whatnot years ago. I try to shrug it off and believe her excuses of 'oh i was just talking to my dad and then took a shower and forgot.' and i cant help but think  the only reason she wouldnt reply even in the morning is because when she looks at my text she opens it and just says 'fuck it, not worth my time' she is a couple years older than me, so idk if she just doesnt like texting or what, but when shes over, she'll reply to people right away. \n\nI guess this turned into a rant but whatever. If anyones reading this long, let me ask you this,  Am i also the asshole for wanting to have sex? Its been a good amount of time now and she never seems to be in the mood around me or to me. We'll mess around a little with foreplay and stuff rarely but it hasnt gone farther than that for a while. She says she just doesnt like sex, but idk what im supposed to do when i do.

A little background, I have been a hockey player my whole life, and I broke on to my school's varsity hockey team as a freshman, and have started every game since day 1.

I also had a real chance to break the county record of 122, considering I scored 37 goals my sophomore year. It became a running thing with my buddies, and I gained a lot of notoriety for it around the smaller town. Well, a week before the season starts, my older sister (22) and her boyfriend were home on Thanksgiving break. This guy, a big guy mind you, wanted to play football with me and some of my buddies in the yard. I said sure. However, in an effort to impress my sister, this guy tackled me as hard as he could in a simple game of touch football. He ended up breaking my wrist, and we had to go to the hospital for it. Doctor tells me I can't play for minimum 8 weeks, considering the physicality of hockey. This takes me to the near end of my senior season. Now, I won't be able to break either record, and I feel like what I loved has been ripped from me. My sister told me to \"man up and how its not a big deal (missing the hockey season). She knows this has been a big part of my life my whole life, and doesn't seem to care. This was in late November, and I still haven't spoken to her more than saying hello over the phone.

He's funny and personable, if a little quiet. \n\nBut Paul's wife Sharon is... something else.\n\nThe few times I've gone to their house, Sharon has been nothing short of frigid. She is silent aside from \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". She will stare daggers at you the whole time you are in her presence, like you are completely inconvenient to her existence. Basically from the minute you walk in their house, even if you've been invited over, it feels like she is counting down the seconds until you leave. She's not verbally rude, but she gives off a definite negative energy and body language.\n\nI asked my fiancé if maybe I did something to piss her off or offend her, but apparently she's been like that towards him for the last twenty years so... that's just her personality I guess.\n\nOriginally I was going to invite her to the wedding anyway. But then it came to my attention that she has made multiple posts on her social media denigrating us and our relationship (usually alongside denigrating Paul). Comments about her loser husband's loser friends. Comments about me being an idiot for dating my fiancé. Just snide little posts that are vague enough someone on the outside might not know who she was talking about, but specific enough that it's pretty obvious to anyone who knows my fiancé or I.\n\nBetween her obvious disdain for her husband (repeatedly calling him names, questioning his masculinity, disparaging his income even though he's the one supporting both of them) and her obvious disdain for my fiancé and I, I don't want her at the wedding. I would LOVE for Paul to attend, but to be frank I feel like Sharon can go fck herself. I don't want that energy anywhere near my celebration.\n\nFiancé thinks it would be an asshole move to invite Paul without inviting Sharon, and is worried Paul wouldn't show up if his wife is excluded. His feeling is we should take the \"kill them with kindness\" route. \n\nSo what say ye, Reddit? Would I be the asshole to send Paul an invite with no +1 attached?",

            "input": "TL;DR. My mother mistreats me and my little brother but I don't know if I am making it worse. I feel like my lack of contribution around the house is not helping, and while I'm trying to fix it, I'm busy with school and constantly tired. I just want to be able to be a normal teenager--make mistakes and slack off sometimes--but I don't get the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has had abusive tendencies since I was young. Her first response to my negative behaviors as a child was to beat me, and when I got too big to beat, to yell and scream, knowing quite well I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She treats my younger brother similarly. He's 8, I'm 16.\n\nHere's an example of her behavior.\n\nA few weeks ago, she sent me in an Uber to pick up some food for her from Popeyes'. She demanded a particular deal that involved a leg, wing, and thigh, as well as a biscuit and drink, for 3.99. I knew damn well they didn't have that, especially in the pricy neighborhood I was in, but I asked anyway. I'm cripplingly shy, so I didn't want to press the issue, and bought her and my brother tenders by mistake.\n\nWhen I brought them home, she FLIPPED OUT. An honest-to-god screaming fit, tears, voice-breaking, the entire 9 yards, hollering she didn't like tenders, she wanted (insert dead bird parts here). To me, they're the same fucking bird, but okay, I guess. The part that pissed me off was when she insisted I didn't care about her because I didn't know she didn't like tenders. To this, I asked her which condiment I preferred--barbecue sauce or ketchup. She said ketchup. I like barbecue sauce. She insisted that it wasn't the same thing, and said I was inattentive.\n\nLater, she \"apologized\". Well, not really. She forgave me for bringing her tenders and said she appreciated my efforts. She did not say sorry for calling me, in so many words, an awful daughter. Over fried chicken.\n\nTo me, it was a completely childish response to a relatively simple problem. Howling your lungs out like a four year old because you got a piece of a bird and you wanted another piece of a bird is not how adults should behave. If I, a hormonal teenager, who has panic attacks about makeup sponges, can understand that, a woman in her forties certainly should. \n\nHere's another example.\n\nToday she screamed at and physically threatened my 8 year old brother for emailing the teacher about a missing assignment--to clarify, she asked him check Google Classroom, and he misunderstood . I was too afraid to go look, but based on the changes in her voice, she hit or pinched him at least once. In the same paragraph of speech, she insisted that TV/computer use is making him stupid and then said that he wasn't stupid and could listen to her. \n\nNow, from what it you've just read, she seems like an asshole. Granted. \n\nBut today, after more screaming when I told her she's always angry at us, she brought up two things: one, that I am ungrateful, and two, that me and my father aren't doing enough in the home to help my little brother.\n\nWith the first, I can kind of understand where she's coming from. In her mind, she's never wrong, and for me to be upset with her to the point of crying for throwing a skirt at me seems like a ridiculous and unfair thing to do. I disagree, of course, but I see her logic. \n\nWith the second, she's right. Completely. For a lot of my life, my dad has been just \"there\". He provides, and sometimes talks to me, but he doesn't try to do things with me or take me anywhere. He doesn't really give me advice unless I ask for it, or tell me to do anything if it doesn't directly pertain to him (i.e. I don't want to do this, so do it). He's the same way towards my younger brother (with some improvements). But my mother has made my brother into a little tyrant: he doesn't listen to or respect anyone but her. He fusses at me and is short with his father. We can't really tell him to do anything, and I can't really make him.\n\nAnd I admit, I am a lazy piece of shit. My room is a disaster, and other than taking care of our three dogs and making sure they're fed, clean, and toileted, I don't do much. I try to help with the sink--make sure stuff doesn't build up in there, and that kind of thing. I'm a senior in high school--I skipped a couple grades--and just generally going through some tough stuff right now, so it's kind of difficult. Studying for tests, keeping my grades up, making sure I graduate by getting my service hours--it's a lot on my plate. My workload has increased 1000x since last year.\n\nI'm also super irresponsible. Just in general. I'm working on it, but I feel like I lost a good chunk of my development to depression in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. I feel stunted.\n\nAnd I'd just like to share that until very recently, my mother didn't do anything around the house. She has walked the dogs maybe 6 times in the two years we have lived here (she forces them to be in a little room near the garage because \"she doesn't like animals up under her\"\\[our dogs are cuddly\\], and complains that my room isn't clean enough to have them live permanently with us). She does not wash dishes, nor clean up after the rarity that she cooks--she recently started baking bread, and leaves the sink piled high with dishes every time. She then proceeds to complain that the sink is full of dishes and no one is doing anything about it. \n\nBut she works a lot. She just graduated school and is running three businesses. I feel like she resents me a little because I was born at a time that wasn't opportune for her and disrupted her life. I do feel like she's in the wrong a lot, but I want to extend sympathy to her. I can't imagine the amount of stress she's put herself through for us, and I am grateful for what she has done. I just wish she wouldn't treat us like shit and say it's fine because she provides for us. I didn't choose to be here. \n\nShe is not open to communication, and no amount of discussion will fix this, so I just want to know: is this entirely her fault, or are me (and my father) partially to blame? If so, how much?",

I asked her if she had an e-mail or knew who I could contact, and she provided that information.  So I e-mailed them and got a call a couple of days later to schedule an interview.\n\nShe asked if I told this person that I got his e-mail from her.  I didn't.  He said it was his personal e-mail and he wasn't sure how I got it, \\*but\\* he didn't ask AND I didn't tell.  He just proceeded to tell me about the position, and how they are hiring for all positions (FT/PT/PRN) at the moment.  He told my friend (when she interviewed over a week ago) that they weren't hiring anyone else.  Well, my friend spoke to this contact person today because apparently, she has not yet given them their decision on whether or not she accepts.  She is still waiting to hear back from another place that is basically her dream job, and asked if she could have until Monday or Tuesday.  Well, I guess this person sounded a little irritated and wants her decision by today.  Personally, I don't think this has anything to do with me, because she \\*has an offer\\*, and I don't.  I still need to interview.  \n\nShe said I should have waited, blah blah blah, I thought you were my friend, and didn't think I would have e-mailed them so quickly.  But see...she could have told me to wait, or not give me the e-mail at all, and I would have respected that!  I also saw this position on Indeed some time ago, but when I found out she applied and was in the process of scheduling an interview, I held off, out of respect to her as a friend because I knew she was desperately looking for a job and I have one.  I told her I would wait to contact them until after she got an offer.  Well, she got an offer, so I thought it was okay for me to go ahead and proceed.\n\nIt's not like I'm stealing this position away from her.

I wasn’t super happy about it, but I put up with it because I know that she has been there for me when I was sick.\n\nNow, whenever my dad or me gets sick, we take a range of different medicine regularly to try to fight it off ranging from DayQuill/NyQuill, to zinc tablets (which have been clinically shown to shorten colds), to Dimetapp at night. Apart from that, we drink lots of liquids.\n\nSo as I’ve been taking care of her, I suggest that she takes some medicine, but she rarely would take anything except for Advil, which lowers her fever I guess. To top that, she would drink barely any fluids (like maybe 10-12 oz per day). All of this made me mad, but I didn’t try to push it too hard on her.\n\nToday however (basically a couple of weeks since she first started feeling symptoms), I woke up and felt really sick. I went to my mom (still sick btw) and told her that I was a bit mad at her for getting me sick because she didn’t try to take any medicine to shorten her cold. She told me that she’s sorry I got sick and that, yes, it’s probably from her, but that she doesn’t think the medicine has any correlation.\n\nObviously there are no guarantees with something like this, and I could have gotten sick from her even if she had been taking medicine, but I still feel like she’s to blame for not really attempting to fight the sickness at all.

The look on their face is priceless! Usually they are really surprised and then I explain how I know Spanish.\n\nMy question is, would it be different if I did this to an SO? I thought it would be pretty funny to play the long con on them, and then maybe in a few months bust out the Spanish on some random occasion and see how they react. However, I saw on another post that someone lied about their middle name for a few months and people were saying YTA to her.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I did this?

I asked him why he was acting so weird and he wouldn't tell me. \n\nEventually a couple of mutual friends told me that Ian has had a big crush on me for awhile and that I was the only one in the dorm hall that didn't know. It's been a week and Ian and I haven't really spoken to each other because its been so awkward, but I've been hearing weird things that he's done or said. For example, last Wednesday he refused to talk to anyone and was only using sign language. I've also been told that he said \"Well MooseLand's boyfriend is a senior so they're not going to last long. I'm not giving up\".\n\nToday he texted me and asked if I was upset because he insulted my boyfriend. I said \"I mean it definitely wasn’t cool, but I’m upset about other things as well\". He apologized for the lack of communication and then followed the apology up with \"on the flip side though, you probably could have done a better job communicating what was going on with (boyfriend)  months ago. I think you were a little naive/unrealistic about what was happening\". I explained to him that my boyfriend and I only started dating in January and that I told him about my boyfriend multiple times. I also said that I had zero idea that he was attracted to me. The final text he sent me was \"Oh wow. Literally everyone in (Dorm Hall) knew I had feelings for you, I assumed you did too. My bad. I guess I took things wayyy too slow. It’s too bad because we have damn good chemistry\".\n\nAm I the asshole? Because I'm starting to feel really guilty.",

I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said “no, why’re you so persistent.” She then states that if I wasn’t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol’ reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn’t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing.

I would estimate that she’s been in the hospital for more than a year (if I were to add up the length of all her stays in the past six years). \n\nAs time has gone on, I have found myself unable to emotionally respond to her health issues anymore. I can logically respond and ask her questions about whatever her current issue is, but there isn’t an emotional switch that goes on. This is odd to me because I work with patients in other capacities and I often overly feel concerned for them and their wellbeing. But with my mom, it’s like my feelings have been overstimulated so much that they have fizzled out. As a result of this, I find myself getting irritated or exasperated whenever she tells me about what feels like yet another issue and I end up being very short with her. \n\nMy post today was prompted by her telling me about chest pain (which she always has to some degree, but tonight it’s been worse) after I spent literally 13 hours outside of the house. I was visibly irritated which I know hurt her feelings since she views me as her main confidante in the house, but I honestly couldn’t even pretend tonight. I love my mom dearly and she has done so much for me and advocated for me while I was growing up so I feel terrible about my inability to connect to her issues emotionally/feel empathy. \n\n\nPlease tell me if AITA!

On mobile while the kids are having naptime, forgive any errors please. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy Great Grandpa(GG) recently turned 89. I am 29, turning 30 very soon. All my life I was the \"favorite\" grandchild of his, but I am pretty sure its just because my Grandma, (who raised me, and whose Father GG is), took me to hang out with him so often. But even if that was the reason, GG and I always had a good relationship. \n\nI have always been bigger then other kids and people my age, but it wasnt until maybe the past four years that I have slipped into the probably obese category. (I am not really wanting any advice regarding that, I know my issues there.) Between heavy depression, lack of care for myself, being content in a happy relationship, and PCOS, I have quite a bit of extra weight that is a struggle to lose. (But I am trying one pant size down this year! :3) Before this bit of weight gain, even though big, I was \"fat in the right places\" big. My GG used to creepily call me \"Hot Momma\" whenever I hugged him in public... Which was often as he always invited me out for lunch and dinner. I also spent a significant amount of time just hanging out with him at his house too. \n\nBut once I got properly fat, he stopped inviting me out as much, and whenever I would stay at his house he didnt really talk to me and just sorta acted awkward for lack of a better word. He would quickly finish dinner and be off to his \"man cave\" rather than socializing like he used to. We always go over to his house for Christmas, and for 2018 Christmas he decided to not give any of my family presents. (Husband and 15 year old daughter, as well as me.) I didn't say anything at the time, but all three of us sorta had our feelings hurt as he had made sure to give lots of other people presents, but somehow forgot us. \n\nThis was relayed to me by my Grandma later:\nMy Grandma asked GG if he had given me a present, and he grumpily said \"No, and I didn't give daughter or husband any either.\" He then told her that he didnt like me being around as much \"since I got fat\" because I make him, my 89 year old Great Grandpa, \"look bad\" and I am not \"hot\" anymore. \n\nOnce my Grandma told me about this I was livid and my feelings were so hurt I almost felt nauseous. I haven't said anything to GG as he's mostly deaf and really doesn't listen to me anyways. But since then... I have had no desire to go see him. I feel guilty about not doing it, I know he's old and doesn't have long but I just can't stand him at the moment. \n\nTL;DR \nAITA for not wanting to visit my Great Grandpa anymore after he said he didn't like having me around since I got fat and am no longer attractive in his mind, making him \"look bad\" in public? \n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.

            "input": "I'm an alcohol abuser. I binge drink sometimes, self-medicating sedative for sure, but pot's more my deal and I love how it helps me create and be up, optimistic and engaged, whereas drinking numbs my issues and just shuts me down. Socially, I drink more, part of the flock, but, when I'm home, I largely avoid it to remain productive and would love to quit entirely, no judgement on anyone who relies upon the drink to get them through. I understand.  I'd just like to stop, altogether. \n\nMy wife drinks too, but not really socially, more like constantly.  It's been every night for years.  Happy times, sad times, all times, a bottle of wine a night.  I know of issues she has, and I understand how self-medicating works. But she has always shown such a lack of interest in trying to rein it in. I don't push - I get it.  But it started to attack her health, and she gained weight, her health deteriorating over many years of nightly pounding the wine down, along with questionable dietary habits. I ride mountain bikes, walk a lot, work out, and she just doesn't want to be active, for whatever reason, I still don't know what that block might be.  \n\nFortunately, our doctor confronted her with a diabetic prognosis, as a result of her weight gain from both food and alcohol abuse as well as physical inactivity and she had a woke moment and decided she needed help.  So, she got gastric bypass surgery as a way of forcing her to pay closer attention to her health.  She would have to follow a dutiful regimen because of the surgery.\n\nIn a year, she lost 125 pounds, and I've been so proud of her.  She's been ecstatic, glowing, excited and empowered.  I've loved watching her rediscover life and have shared in all of her victories day by day.  Our marriage has strengthened as we've affirmed that we were in this together.\n\nIt's well-documented that there are some psychological side-effects that come from this kind of surgery and that also, many still revert to their old ways in time.  My wife has been a model patient, defying all of the standard results for this procedure.  No complications, a tremendous boost of energy and dedication to remaining fit and the realization that she'd committed to a life-long lifestyle.  I told her from the start that I'd be there with her, side by side and step by step as she redefined her approach to physical and mental well-being.\n\n9 months after the surgery, she stopped working out so much, very much pleased with her progress, and then she dropped right back into drinking heavily again.  But, her smaller stomach couldn't process the booze as well, so she began getting drunker quicker and more severely.  This progressed to full-on drunk-every-night sessions that would leave her on the couch, head hanging forward, dead to the world, full-on passed out.  I'd never seen her like this before.\n\nWe'd go out somewhere and we'd both be ordering drinks, but she'd end up wrecked in half the time, and we'd often have to bail on our plans in order to get her home.  She was stumbling drunk every time, and she had to lean on me extensively as we aborted date nights to get her back home where she could pass out in private.\n\nI thought I was getting my wife back when she got the surgery, but there are issues that continue to press her towards the booze.  I recognize my own issues with the drink and have decreased my usage over the past few years, especially at home, where we could support each other.   I've told her many times that I would stop drinking completely if she would do the same.  Because the two of us are stronger together than each of us alone.  If both of us are of like mind on something, there's no stopping us.  We're like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis at the end of \"True Lies\"; working the room together and owning it.\n\nI told her again, tonight, that I would cut back on drinking if she would.  Together, we'd get a handle on this thing.  We didn't have to stop drinking forever, just maybe not as much. I'm ready.  She said that she wasn't quite ready, yet.  The same thing that she's been telling me for years.  I went alcohol-free for a year, for myself and to serve as a witness.  She didn't change her intake one bit.  I got something out of it, some lucidity, some better habits, a sense of control that I didn't think I possessed.  But she didn't share that depth of attempt. And it was hard to quit cold turkey in a house full of booze.\n\nI'm willing to dial it down to zero and she's not willing to dial it down at all.  I know she's dealing with a lot of baggage, from childhood to some of the mindfucks that come with the surgery that she endured a year ago.  I don't blame her for drinking.  I just don't know what to do in the face of her saying, \"I can't stop right now.\"\n\nShe was very sweet when I told her all of this.  We're not arguing.  I asked her if she's happy and she said, exuberantly, \"yes!\"  I'm happy too; she's a wonderful woman. We have fun, we have a great relationship, we enjoy each other's company, it'll be 15 years of marriage next year and 17 years of being together. But something is compelling her to drink in excess seven days a week, and I just don't know what to do.  \n\nAnd because I DO drink, and know WHY I do and tell her so, but refrain from the intense levels at which she imbibes, I just wonder if I'm being an asshole.  Do I even have room to speak?\n\n",

We have all come off the same flight which was delayed by 2 hours, so are 2 hours behind our individual schedules on top of the impending 6 hour roadie.   \n\nWe're having toilet breaks along the way but are all keeping it as brief as possible. We're driving away from a lunch break when a girl yells out to the driver to stop- she's lost her phone. A bit of communal panic ensues and we of course turn around and head back.\n\nThe girl is travelling with her bf who is obnoxious in a few ways: yawning ridiculously loudly in a small space without covering his mouth, falling asleep numerous times and essentially resting himself on my shoulder (I would politely inch forward until his gf would pull him back over), ball space to suit 3 men, etc etc. \n\nSo, she loses her phone and is STRESSED. We pull up, she jumps out, the driver jumps out as well and helps her look (we're on a small touristy island - in my home country - I can confidently say that if someone finds the phone, they're not handing it in). The bf doesn't get out to help her (???) but kind of looks around the seat half heartedly and ends up finding it under the seat. \n\nHe announces with zero sense of urgency: \"Yeah it's here ha ha, she's unbelievable.\"  We're all relieved. Maybe 15 seconds goes past and everyone's like uhh are you going to tell her? And he says, \"no she deserves to panic, she's always losing her shit, this happens all the time. Let her panic\". He says that she has to learn her lesson one day or another. I say half-jokingly, (enough for him to hear but not making a statement to the whole van) \"maybe right now isn't when she needs to learn the lesson though?\" He ignores me.\n\nWe're a van full of strangers watching her and the driver frantically run around this dodgy restaurant and he's laughing, and someone comments \"it's funny but the driver is out there stressing too sooo...\" Bf responds with: \"classic. She's so ridiculous. She would be so pissed.\"   By now we've awkwardly watched this shitshow for about 5 minutes. \n\nMe: \"surely tell her now?\"\nHim: \"no, it's funny?\" (Smug at this point). \n\nSo I lean over him, open the door and yell \"WE FOUND IT!\" She gets back in totally relieved and apologetic, we're all kinda laughing (with her) to make light of the situation. I say, \"he found it the moment you got out of the van\" and again others laugh, she laughs too but also looks at him like seriously?! \n\nHe then gives me absolute you-asshole daggers, mutters something under his breath and, to let her into her seat makes a point of completely shoving me out of the way (he's a 6 foot 3 male, I'm a 5 foot 3 female). Tbh this wouldn't sit well with me any other day but I've gotta sit next to the bloke for another 3 hours.\n\nSooo AITA for \"ruining the joke\"?   ",

A bit of fuss comes from her side as shes mad that i forgot, which is understandable. its about a 40 minutes drive and i get there and i'm as happy as possible because i don't like seeing her mad at me, i try cheering her up and i end up fixing things with good attitude. We get to the mountain to go hiking after we eat and turns out its closed. We head back to hers and stay there for a good 40 minutes, 10 of which were us sleeping. At this point i'm tired and have been out since about 9a.m and its 8. I decide i want to go home, she gets mad and gives me attitude as i leave. \n\nI understand this because we planned to go hiking since the beginning of the week, i was as excited as she was, granted I forgot, i am always excited to see her. Before I even leave her neighborhood shes texting me about how excited she was about seeing me and how shes mad i left early. I'm thinking to myself, \" just because our plans didn't go like we thought, doesn't mean i'm obligated to spend more time with you\". Call it selfish but i like home and just felt tired. When i'm home she calls me and demands an apology for not wanting to spend time with her, how i don't want to see her, and because i left early. In my mind, I am in control of my life, if i wanted to go home, i have that right. I mean i don't want to be extremely biased but is that not natural? Extra: we have been dating for three years and she will constantly tell me she doesn't feel appreciated and that i don't show that i love her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to spend some time alone after a failed date?",

            "input": "We met in college about 10 years ago and hit it off immediately. She is the loud, sometimes obnoxious, attention loving performer-type and I, the goofy, introverted hermit, emotional artist-type. \n\nThe dynamic of our relationship has always been that I'm there for her whenever she needed me and if she was struggling with something, I was happy to spend however long talking her through it. I'm assuming with as much as I've done for her and helped her out in the past, she felt like she could rely on me. But, it wasn't so much the same for me. See, most of our conversations would always somehow end up focusing on her, even if it was something \\*I\\* wanted to talk about. Still, I considered her as my best friend and even an extended family member for all the events/family dinners she's been at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward...I leave our hometown, move across country a few times, get married. She stays back home, pretty much doing/living the same life before I left. We halfassedly keep in touch while I'm away, and we even organize double dates/hangouts when I'm back home. But, over time, keeping in touch becomes more and more difficult and there's resentment compounding on my end for ridiculously stupid things like \"she never likes my pictures on instagram\", \"she didn't message to ask if I was ok when she saw I was in the hospital\", \"I'm always the one saying hello and she takes forever to respond to texts, yet she hits me up when she needs help with something\", etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo eventually, I got sick and tired of her shit and sent her this text;\n\n \n\nHey dude,\n\nJust wanted to reach out to apologize for being in town for over a week and not getting in touch. To be honest, I’ve been kind of upset over the past few weeks and I got to a point where I thought it would be best not to reach out. It hit me some time later that letting anger get in the way of honest expression is the reason why most friendships wither and die over time. So my idea in being completely honest with you here is so that I have a chance to get it off my chest, give the situation an opportunity to unveil all of the hundreds of other possibilities my one perspective might be missing, and most importantly give this friendship another chance to survive. \n\nI want to be super clear that while this message may seem one sided - it’s just me expressing everything I feel. And, what I feel is all I know. I fully open the possibility of being completely wrong and having misunderstood things. Ultimately, I’m reaching out because I’m not comfortable in making my own assumptions of the truth to a two sided story. How could I possibly?\n\nAnyway, for as long as I’ve been capable, I’ve always done my best to help you. I answered your call when I was on vacation to walk you through Instagram marketing, set up your YouTube ad campaign over the holidays, and have never hesitated to share with you anything and everything I’m doing that has helped me - in order to help you. I never expected anything in return because that’s not why I chose to help. I helped because I thought we had a mutual respect and care for one another as friends and as independent artists. But every time I reached out to say hello, I’d never get a response, and when I did it was super delayed and the excuse was always the same. I became extremely ill right around your birthday but I messaged to wish you a happy birthday but you didn’t respond until a week later, after you saw that I was in the hospital. By the end of all that - you reached out to ask me what happened, I was so tired of not being responded to, that I answered in a way to cut the conversation to avoid waiting for a response that would never come. That made me so sad. And made me wonder if you really cared. \n\nSo, ultimately it was time to go back home for a visit and I was extremely resentful towards you. To me, it feels like I’ve inserted many coins in this friendship vending machine only to feel like I’ve just come up short. You may have noticed that I didn’t mention being busy as an excuse I’m interested in talking about. I know how busy I am and I’m assuming your schedule is no different. \n\nIn all honesty, I wasn’t going to send this at until I played this 30 min exercise / game and it opened my eyes to why I should. (do it on desktop browser to fully understand what I’m talking about). \n\nWhatever happens I feel good about being honest with you. Life’s too short to be angry and I don’t want to keep thinking about it. I will always love you.\n\n\\----------\n\nShe responded by saying she needed time to think things through and that she loved me and respected me...but then turned around to unfriend/unfollow me and she hasn't bothered to reach out like she lead me to believe she would. I feel hurt and used obviously, but the question that wracks my brain constantly is this...Am I an asshole for calling her out? Did I make it impossible for her to want to remedy the friendship? Was I too aggressive? I want to know what I did wrong to warrant her wanting nothing to do with me. It's so f\\*\\*\\*ing confusing. \n\nThx for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "This past fall I started college and decided to room with a high school friend of mine who we’ll call Dan. I had been good friends with Dan throughout high school. We had many similar interests and he had actually gone on vacation with my family the year before. \n\nAnyway, a bit into the first semester everything is ok, sometimes he’d ignore me if I tried to talk or would just walk in and out without acknowledging me, but overall it wasn’t too bad. Eventually pledge week at college rolled around and he pledged and I didn’t. Everyone that I knew pledged, and it was really hard for me to be the only one that wasn’t. I had the option to but long story short it really wasn’t for me. Anyway I spent most of the week depressed and lonely because everyone I knew was so busy and couldn’t even talk to me due to pledge week. I had a panic attack one day and my parents came down to make sure I was ok even. By the end of the week I was doing a better and was more stable. One of my other friends informed Dan that I was having a rough week at the beginning of pledge week and needed a good friend. Dan ignored me all week. That Saturday Dan was sick from pledge week, and I went to lunch with a friend. While at lunch Dan messaged me and went off about me needing to change my attitude before I came back to the room. And continued to go off at me. I asked why he was acting like that because I hadn’t done anything and he just kept on. I eventually ended up breaking down in my friends car due to this. The next day I decided to confront Dan on what he’d done. He claimed that he never sent those messages (they were on Snapchat) and began to scream at me and told me to go to hell. That night he ended up in the hospital, so the whole argument had no effect.\n\nOnto before Thanksgiving break, everything is perfectly fine between us. Then once break happens he invites our old friend group from home to hang out multiple times and excludes me. He ignored me in person one day on break. Upon returning to campus he continued giving me the silent treatment. Rarely replying to me and looking away when I walked in. He would blare music in the room when I was trying to work or sleep, and would slam the door when he left the room. All of this caused a substantial amount of stress on me. Near the end of the semester I told him that I was moving out. I started to explain that it was just a stressful situation and I didn’t want any hard feelings (it’s not you it’s me), and he interrupted and said if I didn’t want to be there then I didn’t want to be there and that’s all there is to it. We didn’t talk again until winter break. I moved out and headed home and he sent me a text message saying “Since you left without saying bye, bye have a good break” he hasn’t talked to me since and I’ve since found out that he’s gone to his and my friends telling them I stopped talking to him and was an asshole to him this whole time, and some of them take his side.

My issue is that when we go out to the bars in our small town, one of the  guys, lets call him Josh, gets really weird around girls.Now Josh is in decent shape and smart but when he opens his mouth to talk to women they get this look on their face like they are about to vomit. This has happened 6+ times. In his defense one of our other friends told  me a story about how the first girl he took home made fun of his micro-penis and he hasn't been with one since.\n\nLet's call the next one Emily. She's a bigger girl, whose Bi.Whatever.Tons of fun. When she talks to new people it goes \"HiMyNameIsEmily.I'm bi. I like boys and girls. I have a bf hes cool with it can I get your number,\" all in one breath. In her defense shes better than Josh. \n\nSo  Josh, Emily and I are at the bar. We just getting drunk keeping ourselves until the third bar and I run into this Hottie I have been talking to for a bit. I go over to say Hi how are ya, shes laughing everything's kosher. Emily and Josh slide over. Josh says \"You know this guy he's fucking asshole, total a piece of shit.\" \n\nHotties like \"uhh what?!!\"\n\nMe- \"This is Josh hes my friend hes just joking.\"\n\nEmily-\"Hi my name is Emily.I'm bi.That means I like boys and girls. I have a bf hes cool with it.Do you want to play pool with us?\" Hottie-\"Sure that sounds fun.\" Emily -\"We should hang out more whats your number..Did you hear me, whats your number.\"\n\nShe gives her number like okay lets get this over with. And its almost okay until Josh starts making jokes about raping dead babies that fall flat. He doesn't know what to do, so he doubles down. Doesn't work. So I just lean over and  I'm whisper \"dude chill just try to be normal,\" so only he can hear. And he shouts \"Fuckman, I'm just being the scumbag so you look better by comparison and  can fuck this girl, you'll see, it will work.\" She and her friends hear, total cringefest. She turns around and just completely ignores us, to talk to random dudes that swaggered up, like sharks that smell blood. Then Emily says to me \"Well, you really mess that up, I'll talk to her tomorrow see if she wants to hang out with us.\" At this point I  am in awe. If I didn't know these people I'd say they were fucking with me.\n\nI go to  the bathroom Emily and Josh pull an Irish exit. Hottie instantly walks away from sharkies back over to me says I don't know how I am getting home, I have to move my car do you want to come with? Sure love too. She backs to happy and giddy. We get to her car and  shes says \"I texted my friend to come pick me up. (Cucked.) but I had  fun.\" No worries\n\nNow  it's not the first time that Josh and Emily have made me feel awkward around women. So reddit AITA for not wanting to go out in public with my gamer friends and suggest we keep our relationship at the gaming table?\n\n2 many words. Lesser cringe stuff cut.",

A few weeks ago I had this idea to basically create starter pack memes of each of my friends poking fun at all the quirky and small things they do or have done. This went really well for the first few of my friends as I quickly slopped together some Google images and pasted them in mspaint. \n\nHowever, we have this one friend, we'll call him T, who is generally kind of recognized as the pretentious friend of the group. As I worked my way through each of my friend's memes, T takes notice and asks for a starter pack of himself. I tell him that he'll have to wait until I get through some of the other people's before I started working on his. He obliges initially for a little while, but then he begins to become a little more persistent while also requesting that I pull no punches on his, making sure to really \"push his shit in.\" His words, not mine. Anyway, I finish up and begin working on his  starter pack when he says that anything relating to him \"acting smarter than he actually is\" is low effort and unoriginal.\n\nHere's the thing about T. I mentioned that he was the \"pretentious\" friend, but in general he's a pretty good guy. However, sometimes, he gets too big for his britches and I feel like I need to knock him down a few pegs, so hearing that I should pull no punches on his starter pack, I went all out on him. Over the next couple of days, I made a giant collage of all the weird and strange things he tends to do, but also went after all of his deepest insecurities in making his starter pack as he had requested.\n\nAfter it was all done, I immediately thought that perhaps I had gone a little too far. However, persistent as he is, T demanded that I post it. I really hesitated posting it, even going so far as to make him sign a \"consent form\" for what he was about to see. I upload the image and immediately T shits on it, calling it unoriginal, low effort, disappointing, and 0/10. I felt a little bad as I had worked on this for a few days only for it to be put down, but whatever.\n\nHowever, things got weird from here. Following this, T completely and suddenly disappears off discord and cuts all communications with the friend group for the next two weeks, deleting his discord account one week in. Rightfully so, the whole group starts to get increasing worried about his whereabouts as we try to contact him to no avail. A few hours ago, though, one of my other friends broke through to him to ask what happened to him, only to learn that he left because of the image that I had posted.\n\nAm I the asshole?

A few months later I suddenly get a warning that someone logged in on Netflix on another country. Worried about it, but seeing as it was from my GF's homecountry, I asked her about it and yes, she had given account access to her mother. I told her I didn't appreciate it the fact that she didn't ask me about it first, honestly if she had done so I wouldn't have had an issue with it. \n\nAbout a week later, I get another notification, same country. Took me longer to find out, but apparently her mother had given her brother the account as well. Now I was pissed, because at this point I felt like I had no control over who was using my account. She was telling me her mother didn't think anything of it, which fine, I think it's rude but let's give her the benefit of the doubt. I told my GF that if there were going to be more new login or access requests to please tell me first and I would be fine with it. It costs me nothing per month, and it's a major plus for them. \n\nBut then this dude started to log in on different devices, and I got in about 2 weeks repeated log in notifications from Netflix (about one every 2-3 days), and every time I would ask my GF to please check with her family. Every time it was. The tipping point came when my subscription got changed, supposedly I guess because the maximum number of simultaneous devices had been reached, and her bro (according to her not knowing English) just saw some pop-up  and clicked \"OK\" to continue and watch whatever. \n\nI was mad at this, I felt that at the very best case scenario her brother did not give a shit about using someone else's service, not understanding that this was lent as a favor, and should be letting me or my GF know before hand when logging in or asking if he didn't know what he was doing. At the worst, I now had a bunch of unknowns using my account. \n\nMy GF ended up getting her own Netflix account, which to me is a relief. But she still says I am a mayor asshole for making a big deal out of nothing and still gets incredibly upset when the topic comes up.\n\nI honestly fail to see how sharing something of mine with people I have never met, but asking the to notify me on Whatsapp/FB/Skype/whatever before logging in on different devices is asking for THAT much. Especially having told my GF time and again that sharing accounts and passwords is difficult for me in general. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a paranoid asshole here? Or is she being unfairly critical of what she sees as distrust in her family? I honestly would be just as mad if it were my siblings or best friends doing this.",

(Myself, or my husband do not expect people to kiss his ass, if that's my brother's opinion then whatever, but going off about it two days after my husband left was inappropriate and poor timing IMO. He was extremely rude and explosive about his opinion and said my husband would deserve whatever happened to him on deployment, if he was hurt or killed, because the U.S. was responsible for the deaths of innocent people)\n\nAnyway, yesterday out of the blue, he sends me a messenge on facebook asking me if I would fly to Vegas to be at his wedding in October. I said I would see what I could do because I would flying with two young children across country because my husband would be deployed again. Also, a cross country ticket and hotel in Vegas is pretty pricey. He seemed happy with this answer and said he would let me know definite dates soon. And that was it. \n\nI was a little upset after this exchange for a few reasons:\n\n1) He never acknowledged we haven't spoken for a year, or that he said some messed up stuff to me, about my husband. \n\n2) My son is two and half and he has never acknowledged that his nephew exsists. He never congratulated me on this pregnancy or his birth.

I've been hospitalized a few times, all of which he knows about because my mother tells him about it. \n\n4) He's always crying that family should support family no matter what when he has something going on,  but is never supportive of any family when they have something going. I.E. he was still living in the same town as my older brother when his daughter was born, but never went to the hospital to see her and didnt bother to meet her until a family event months later. \n\nAfter thinking about all of this, I didn't see why I even should spend the money and go through the headache of long flight with two small children. However my parents and some family members have told me I am being petty and should just be a good sister and go. To the point where I'm starting to question if they're being ridiculous or if I'm really just being petty.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just say fuck it, like he has for so long?",

I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something.

My mom and I talked about it in private since she doesn't really understand Twitter and how it works. I told my mom that, yeah we should talk to her about being careful about what she says, especially on the internet but to not worry because when you're in middle school you think cussing makes you \"cool\". I reminded her that I did it as well on my \"fan account\" on twitter and that was she said wasn't even bad. My sister's account didn't have her picture or name on it, if that's an important factor. It wasn't an urgent matter so we didn't address it right away although we obviously planned to. Literally 2 hours after she texted my mom, my cousin decided it was her place to call my sister and lecture her over the phone. I was sitting next to her and could hear my cousin lecturing her and it made me absolutely furious. I told my sister to hand me the phone and I blew up.

That made me even more angry and I told her that she wasn't her mom or her sister and that she needed to mind her own business. Notifying us was enough but it is absolutely NOT HER JOB to lecture my sister. She texted me a half-assed apology. Basically one of those \"I'm sorry IF YOU FEEL blah blah blah\" basically not taking responsibility or seeing anything wrong with her actions. I responded saying that it wasn't her place and that my mom and I had talked about it and she just went ahead and assumed that we weren't dealing with it and had the audacity to call my sister and lecture her. She responded saying that she was calm about lecturing my sister and that I had no reason to be mad (I beg to differ) and I responded with \"It doesn't matter how you delivered it, it was wrong. Period. You were out of place. We talked to her about it and it felt like you were undermining not only me but my mom by calling her. You're not her parent. Like I said, I understand the concern but it's not your job to call her and lecture her.\" My cousin is neither a mom nor a big sister and knows nothing about handling middle school children anway.

She cleans it once every four days (scoops just the clumps and never replacing the litter entirely or scrubbing the box at all) and honestly our apartment just smells like cat litter and poop. I've had to become complacent because every time I explain to her nicely that I pay the rent just like her and would appreciate if she cleaned it every 1-2 days instead, especially since he's a big cat and lays huge turds. Every time I asked her, she would get kind of defensive and would tell me that I jump all over her every time she makes a mistake, and that she's only human. I get that she is only human, but this happens a lot.\n\nI just got back from a week of spring break. She left the day after me, and is coming home in about two hours. I come inside and it REEKS. I check the cat box room, and lo and behold, it's full of shit. She let shit fester in our house for a week. Took the cat with her, but left the litter.\n\nI don't know how to approach her about this. If anything, I am moving out in May. But I am just so, so livid. Especially after talking to her multiple times and it being known that the cat box is a source of serious contention between us. \n\n\nWIBTA if I said something, expressing how angry I am about this?

I (14F) was very close with her up through that but then when I started 8th grade I realized that I actually didn’t like being around her. The bad things hadn’t started yet though. \n\n       A couple months ago Ashley came over to my house and told me that she had started doing drugs. Not cocaine or anything, but weed and experimental things like cough syrup. Also, weed is legal where I live, but certainly not for minors. It’s not for medicinal purposes or anything, either, she just does it for fun. And okay, yes, if I’m being honest, I don’t know that much about drugs and how safe they are, but I just don’t want to associate myself with anything that could end up hurting me or my future. \n\n        So I didn’t do weed with her when she invited me and now I’m beginning to subtly push her away. At least I thought it was subtle. Ashley  said before that she didn’t expect me to pick up the phone when she called. I think she knows I’m pushing her away. She was already very clingy and used to call me every day to ask to hang out, so she still called a lot, just without an answer. \n\nI’m worried that if I directly tell her that I don’t want to be her friend that she would go back into a state of depression, because she got close to hurting herself last time. She missed about a month of school because of it. I’ve begun going to therapy too because all she is is a negative energy in my life. \n\n\nTo sum it up: I feel awful about trying to leave my friend who went through intense depression  recently but she started experimenting with drugs and I don’t want to put me or my future at risk. She’s also manipulative naturally and I still wouldn’t want to be her friend even without the drugs. AITA??",

We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.\n\nMia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.\n\nNow upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.\n\nNow here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.\n\nNow of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.\n\nSo WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.\n\nTL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

It was all nice and I was very thankful, and showed my appreciation by helping with preparing the Christmas food and helping clean up. It was a great Christmas altogether.\n\nWhen I moved into to my Dad’s house 6months later my Mom didn’t say anything about returning the phone to her, since she did pay for it. But this Christmas, my dad bought me the newest iPhone. When I went up to my Mom’s house to spend Christmas with her side of the family, my Mom asked if my Dad bought me the phone, I said yes. My Mom got weird and said something under her breath to my Aunt and I got a bit pissed and asked ‘what was that?’, since she’s always badmouthing my Dad to my other siblings. She replied in an offended tone, ‘Glad to see where his priorities lie’. I asked her what she meant by this. And she went off saying about how he never buys by siblings stuff (which was a lie, he bought my siblings a lot of clothes and toys) and buys be a brand new £1000 iPhone. \n\nI told her I needed a new one since my old one was running very slow. So she asked if she can have it back. I said ‘Why? You bought it for me for Christmas.’ And she said that it’s hers since she bought it for me, regardless of whether she gave it to me as a present, I need to give it back to her.\n\nSo I refused since it was a Christmas present for me, I shouldn’t have to return it just because my dad bought me one.\n\nDoes this make me the asshole?",

She always believed the man should be the breadwinner. Despite us both graduating from college and getting good jobs, I still feel the tension is there. We now combine all of our finances. I make roughly double her income now... but I know that if I made less than her, we would probably argue a lot more. Her mindset is even applied outside of finances. She simply believes that the man should take the burden of everything. She believes her gender allows her a free pass to bend the rules. We fight about this constantly. I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but I’m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... She’s like a “selective” traditional gal. Fall back on her gender roles when it’s convenient for her, but become a feminist when it’s not. \n\nI’m at my wits end about this. \n\nSo AITA for believing this??

The professor gave us a grade for each and it counted for 20% of the yearly grade for this class. I was really motivated to get good grades and so I organised the group work.

I’m going to call him Jeff for this post. We met in middle school and ended up going to the same high school too, but we had an extremely rocky friendship (even longer story so I’m skipping it) until the end of my sophomore year when he convinced me to join a club at our school. We started hanging out a lot during my junior year, and I developed a crush on both him and my now-girlfriend about that October. I had come out to him two weeks previous and he was chill about it, but I knew he was straight so I figured if I asked him out, he’d just reject me and I could move on with my life since that avenue was entirely closed and ask out my current girlfriend instead.\n\nTo my surprise, he said yes anyway. The way he said yes should have been my first red flag. He said, “Well, you’re a dude, so I won’t date you, but we can be friends with benefits.” Now, I was stupid and felt validated and was shocked so I said sure and we made out in his car. When he took me home after that, I felt weird, like I wasn’t really myself? It’s hard to describe, but I found myself staring at my reflection in the mirror and feeling off for a while that night. I brushed it off at the time, but it’ll come back up later.\n\nOver the next two weeks, he slowly warmed up to the idea of us dating. These are the next red flags. He asked me if he could call me his girlfriend, which I was so...weirded out that I was left speechless. We also did a lot of semi-public making out and third base which made me sort of uncomfortable but I wanted the relationship (one that I felt I barely could even have in the first place considering the circumstances) to work so I didn’t say anything and just went along with it when he’d ask to make out for an hour in his car or for me to give him a handjob.\n\nEventually my own anxiety caught up with me and I impulsively broke it off that December. He seemed crushed, as he was finally developing romantic feelings for me, but the addition of romantic pressure to what I recognized was mounting discomfort with physical stuff (particularly because the dynamic of the physical stuff made me feel like “the girl” of the relationship) was too much for me so I nipped it in the bud to save myself.\n\nIf only I had listened to my gut and my raging dysphoria.\n\nHe ended up dating a girl pretty soon after and I started dating my current girlfriend for the first time (our first relationship was pretty dry because we were both pretty awkward so we broke it off after a few months, but we’re extremely happy and almost at 6 months going strong this time around!). However, after we had both broken up with/been broken up with our SOs, he asked me if I wanted to try a relationship again in June. We had been best friends the whole time we were broken up, so it wasn’t hard for feelings to be rekindled there and I agreed.\n\nThis time he upped the ante sexually and every single time we hung out he’d ask for some sort of sexual act, usually a blowjob but sometimes more. He’d also ask me if he could do things to me that made me extremely dysphoric (touching certain parts of my body for extended periods of time and using certain language) and I’d tell him no repeatedly but he’d still ask almost every time we hung out. Our relationship continued into my senior year, which worked because he was in college but living at home. We only saw one another on weekends, time that became unspoken “his time” with me.\n\nI barely hung out with my friends outside of school functions that year because all of my weekends were taken up with Jeff. He didn’t have any friends at college (this probably will come off as biased but everyone I’ve known from high school agrees that he has a weird superiority-inferiority complex that leads him to not give people the time of day if they’re not “smart enough” for him) and his high school friends largely went elsewhere except for two of them.\n\nMost of our time in person and over text was taken up with him talking about his interests and his financial problems with me just having to go along with the conversation and him asking for sexual favors (either sexting, which I was uncomfortable with, or actual sex, which I increasingly turned down out of the crippling anxiety/dysphoria it gave me and actual physical pain it caused me in some circumstances). Because I was in senior year, more and more of my time was taken up with college applications and big projects, so I started saying no to more and more invitations to hang out.\n\nI will admit that that’s not always the only reason I said no, as he was becoming clingy and demanding to the point where just thinking about the weekend made me uncomfortable. I tried my best to communicate my discomfort to him, to the point where I broke down crying on his bed trying to explain my discomfort when he kept asking me for a blowjob when we were watching a movie. After I finished crying, he asked me again and coerced me into putting his dick in my mouth, after which I broke down crying again and asked if he could drive me home. He did, and that was the last time we hung out, as after that I would both deflect for OBVIOUS REASONS! and also because AP exams were approaching and I needed to study.\n\nThe night before one of my exams, he texted me asking if I could come over. I said no, I was studying and had an exam the next day, but he then launched into a long message about how I was avoiding him and “he never had this much work in senior year and he had taken much harder classes than I did” (which may be true on some level as he was taking engineering classes, but I was still taking 4 AP classes, a dual enrollment math class, and an intensive film seminar where I had to make my own short film that was due in a few weeks, so the comparison wasn’t fair in my opinion). He threw out a few different arguments all with the intent to keep me from studying for an exam (including but not\nlimited to making fun of the college I committed to when it’s literally the same college he goes to!) I paid $93 dollars for just so I could give him a blowjob and cuddle him for two hours maximum. I had had enough at that point and told him as such and ended the conversation.\n\nWe didn’t talk much from there and two weeks later he broke up with me, citing how distant I was for the previous few months. As he was breaking up with me, he asked if we could “still cuddle sometimes” to which I said yes, mostly because I didn’t want to burn the bridge at that point, didn’t want him to be upset with me (as he had fallen into a depression in the past over ended relationships), and was riding the relief high of no longer being trapped in the relationship.\n\nFor clarity, I didn’t break up with him myself because I was too scared of disappointing him or at worst sending him spiraling into depression. He was still my best friend, and I cared about him, but I know my choice to sour our romantic relationship without talking to him properly was a very very bad one. I apologized to him for it the day we broke up and he seemed to understand and forgave me.\n\nWe broke up a week before prom, so I ended up going with a group of friends (he didn’t even want to go to prom so this was the plan anyway). It was a great night that I still remember well, except for what happened afterwards. My best friend who we’ll call Nina planned on having a get-together afterwards. We usually had holiday parties or afterparties at her house so this was normal, with the only difference being the very small number of people coming to her house this time around (only like 7, two of whom left before the sleepover portion and one of whom being her boyfriend who was on break from college). Jeff asked her a few days before prom if she was having a party, to which she said yes. No other words were exchanged - he didn’t ask what kind of party, how many people, times, and not if he was invited.\n\nAt midnight, we hear the doorbell ring. I’m upstairs in the spare bedroom (which is on the third floor, for reference) with my current-girlfriend and her then-best friend while Nina, her boyfriend, and our other friend are in the kitchen downstairs. I don’t hear who it is or know what’s going on until a few minutes later. Jeff and his friend are standing in the doorway of the spare bedroom. Nina is standing behind him looking EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he just stands there, smiling awkwardly and not saying anything.\n\nMy CGF asks him what he’s doing here, to which he responds that they were coming back from a metal show and decided to stop by since they were in the area. Keep in mind this is a private party, it was literally the middle of the night, Nina’s parents and sister were sleeping on the second floor, and he had shown up unannounced and with an additional person most of us weren’t really friends with. And he thought this was okay.\n\nHe doesn’t leave until every single person there expresses to him that they’re not going to speak with him until he leaves (apparently he had specifically asked Nina where I was so he could come talk to me, which he should have realized was weird because we hadn’t spoken sense the breakup). When asked about it repeatedly after the fact by me and other people, he refuses to see that he did anything weird, wrong, or otherwise.\n\nAfter that, talking was a bit awkward so I asked him if we could take a bit of a break from our friendship too, as I knew he wasn’t totally over me and I wasn’t totally over my own discomfort being around him (multiplied by that weird encounter after prom).\n\nThe longer we didn’t have contact, though, the more I realized that - not to be dramatic - I m",

I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nLast year, I lived in this house and we had a command hook in the bathroom that I would use to hang up my towel when I showered. While I was out of the country last summer, one my roommates (J) basically redecorated and refurbished the place. When I got back, the command hook was still there, so I hung my towel up there for the shower. Throughout the entirety of the fall semester, no one complained about this whatsoever. I assumed it was the same command hook that was there from last year, but in reality, J bought a new one and hung it up.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, I came home drunk from a bar and for some reason, J decided that 1:00am on a Saturday would be the best time to tell me that I could no longer use this command hook because he bought it and would like to use it to hang up his clothes while he showered. Drunk aitathrowaway1321 slurred \"yeah okay, whatever\" and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning, having absolutely zero memory of this conversation, I showered and then went to the gym to sweat out the hangover. After coming back, I jumped in the shower and noticed that my towel was missing! There was a little blue sticky note next to the hook that said \"missing something? Follow the sticky notes!\" I followed the sticky notes downstairs naked (because no towel) and was greeted with my towel hanging downstairs next to a sticky note that said \"bet you must've missed me after you came back from the gym! Next time, buy your own fucking command hook!\"\n\nI hung the towel on the bannister outside the bathroom to avoid a fight, but I chewed my roommate out for being passive aggressive and not talking to me beforehand. We still sometimes have arguments over this when I forgetfully hang the towel on this command hook, which he really only uses to hang his clothes on while he showers. I feel like his passive aggressive response and him getting angry at me is way overblown for this kind of situation; furthermore, it's kind of unreasonable for him to expect me to change my routine which bothered no one for five whole months! Furthermore, command hooks are literally like $2, so I feel like the response is disproportionate to the overall crime. This situation has also caused my other housemates to gang up on me too, so needless to say, I'm not too happy about it.\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking that my roommate is being unreasonable? I'm trying to avoid a fight, but it's kinda hard to when all of my roommates are now ganging up on me about this. ",

She's received a ton of love, and her mom and sister drove 12 hours to be with her while I'm in the hospital.

Help would be much appreciated!\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was fairly young, and I've divided my time between both houses since then. I get along famously with my mom (even though she's a helicopter, I love her dearly). But, my Dad and his family is another story. Since I started highschool (about 7 years ago now) he and his second wife decided to work constantly. They own a small business, and want it to succeed. But, they also do a lot of volunteer work (I'm so proud of them for it!) However, this has left the task of running our household on my siblings and my shoulders.\n\nFor a few years, this was fine. In highschool I was always on top of my work, and didn't mind coming home at \\~5 pm to cook dinner, clean the house, do the dishes, study a bit, and go to bed. Between my three siblings and I, we've kept a fairly well functioning house! However, as I've gotten older the demands have further increased.\n\nI'm in my junior year of college now, and commute to a nice school \\~40 minutes away from my household. After I spend 4 hours in classes, I go to therapy for an hour (to help with anxiety), and then work a part time shift for 3 hours. After that, I make the \\~40 minute commute home by train. It's around 5 at night when I finally get back.\n\nImmediately after arriving home, I have to put away the dishes I did the previous night. Then I do whatever chores need to be done that day. Often times I walk to the nearby grocery store to buy groceries for the week. I come home, cook dinner, and by that point it's 8 at night. I quickly eat, and then go to finish up whatever else needs to be done (laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom/kitchen, etc). Overall, I finally start on my homework at around 9 pm, and typically go to bed at 1 am... Only to get up early and start the process over again.\n\nI don't have a problem helping out around the house. In fact, I think it makes me more prepared for when I want my own home! But, I've come to resent my Dad and Step-Mom who decided to offload everything onto us. The tipping point for me was Friday, when they asked me to cover the cost of groceries this month. I'm barely making enough to cover my textbooks each semester, so it's a huge ask. I didn't say anything to them about it, just decided to grin and bare it.\n\nThey snap at me whenever something isn't done. Often times the yelling takes longer than it would take to actually do the chore.\n\nI hate that I'm in charge of so much. My days are long, and they're about to get longer (2 of my siblings leave for college in the summer). I get that they pay the bills, but we're a family and I feel like everyone should pitch in.

            "input": "Throwaway because I’m honestly a little ashamed to be telling this story/asking this question. It’s long, I’m sorry. I’m trying to be thorough. \n\nA little backstory: shit’s been rough lately. I used to be very outgoing, very spunky, had many friends. I ran a small local business and was very involved in the community. I’ve never had many problems with friends before, at least not on my end (that anyone has told me about at least). I made friends relatively easily—though I was still picky and cautious about who I let get super close to me—and have never been the kind of girl who’s a gossip or has big falling outs with friends or lots of drama. For the most part, my friendships (definitely the close ones) last a long time...like years, decades long. \n\nBut almost three years ago I was in an accident and it fucked everything up. I broke my spine and got a brain injury. I’ve already had one surgery and we’re waiting on number two. I had to move back in with my parents and temporarily close my business. I cannot do a lot of basic things for myself...including bathing. It’s been extremely hard on me, not just physically, but also mentally. To add to the craziness, I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and then almost immediately after, sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. It’s been a ride, y’all. \n\nBut over the last few months I’ve lost **everyone,** and I don’t know why. \n\nThree of my very best and closest girlfriends have straight up ghosted me. These girls helped me through my first surgery two years ago no problem. These were the girls who were my cheerleaders and helpers for my business, who threw me surprise birthday parties and called me when shit was going down in their lives. I thought we were ride or die. But when I asked girlfriend 1 (we’ll call her Micha) if she still had pictures of her wedding cake that I made for her a few years back, her answer was oddly distant and cold. When I tried to reply, I was blocked. No hints, no conversation, just blocked. \n\nI asked girlfriend 2 (let’s call her Kelly) about it to see if she knew what was wrong, and she brushed it off. “I think Micha was scared because you mentioned committing suicide (over a year ago).” This didn’t make any sense. Micha was the girlfriend I’d had the longest of the three, and she saw me through a horrible breakup in college where depression and suicide was mentioned. I did the same for her about a year later. That had never been a spooky topic before. And besides, that comment had happened over a year ago. I figured she just must need space and dropped it. \n\nThen maybe a month later, Kelly says life is too busy to continue talking to me, and she wants a break. She sends that message to me and at least one other mutual friend. I didn’t take it personally at the time because she was pulling away from everyone, not just me. I was concerned for her, but I wanted to respect her wishes so I told her that I loved her and whenever she was ready to chat and hangout again I would be here. \n\nBuuuut a month-ish after that is when my doctor first said “you might have cancer, I’m sending you to an oncologist.” I was freaked the fuck out. I felt so alone and scared and I didn’t want to tell my parents because it wasn’t a definite yet and I didn’t want to worry them. I needed my best friend so badly. So I called Kelly. She didn’t answer (which I expected), so I left her a tearful voicemail apologizing for calling and saying that I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful and invade her space, but the doc says I might have cancer and I was very scared. I just wanted a hug, honestly. She never returned my call. \n\nGirlfriend 3 (Nancy) moved to another state about a year ago, but we still stayed very close. Sending big birthday packages, long chats, lots of pictures back and forth and keeping each other very involved. She was supposed to be coming home soon and promised to visit, as my place is right down the road from her parents. But suddenly she stopped messaging too, around the same time as Kelly. I finally sent her a text that just said “Nancy, I have something important to tell you.” after the diagnosis was confirmed. She said “So do I. You go first.” I asked her if she could FaceTime, but she said she was still at work, so I said that was fine we can chat when she gets off or tomorrow, whatever works best for her. I never heard back. \n\nI sent all three girls a “wtf is going on” message one tearful night not too long ago. It was long, and probably overwhelming (in fact I sent an apology for the length the next day) but honestly, for a “best friend” it shouldn’t have been some crazy message. I told each of them my diagnosis and that I’m truly at the lowest of the low right now. I feel like I’m trapped in this shell of my body and there’s nothing I can do. I begged them to please tell me what I did wrong to make them ghost so I can fix it. I pleaded with each of them not to leave. But I also told them that they really hurt me, and I felt like I have been abandoned by those that I trusted the most during my deepest tome of need. I sent this individually over Facebook messenger because I naively thought that maybe I wasn’t getting replies because their phones were dead or something. I have been left on read for all three of them, and Micha deleted me as a friend immediately after reading my message. \n\nI don’t know what to do guys. All I can think of is that saying “if you keep smelling dog shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check your shoes.” Please tell me, AMITA? I’m so fucking mad at them. I would never straight up ghost a normal friend, never mind a best friend. *Especially* after they tell me that they have cancer, godfuckingdamn. It feels so shitty and I’m honestly more torn up about it than I am about the cancer.   \nI can provide more details if you want, I just didn’t want to make this longer than it already is.

My grandfather died when I was around 8 and he was a lovely man but he didn’t prevent her behaving the way she did. \n\nMy parents separated when I was 11 and she didn’t bother to stay in contact with me, my brother who was 16 and my sister who was 18. I don’t believe she should take any blame for this lack of contact as we were the kids in the situation and she was the adult. \n\nMy dad basically disappeared from our lives for about 5 years or so as well and I later found she was abusive to him when he was growing up although I’m not sure what form that abuse took. \n\nMy brother’s eldest son was her great grandchild. He is now 15 and she has never met him. My brother has since had another child and my sister has two kids who again she has never met. I am now pregnant with my first child and I know she would not have them this baby either. However she has met and had a relationship with my cousins kids. \n\nI saw her for the first time in years at my Dad’s 60th which I helped to organise, but I didn’t know she would be there. My  Dad’s girlfriend must have invited her. She didn’t acknowledge me or my brother. My sister did not attend as she doesn’t want a relationship with my father. \n\nI have somewhat repaired my relationship with my Dad but I keep it up for his sake mostly. I don’t really get anything out of it. I just feel guilty if I don’t have some sort of relationship with him. \n\nI’m really uncomfortable with the thought of going to the funeral. I barely speak to my cousins and I know they will be fully involved in the funeral. I’m worried they will judge us for coming and blame us for not having a relationship with her. I also don’t want to listen to a eulogy about how great she is when she treated me, my siblings, our kids and my Dad terribly. I also had to take time off sick from work lately due to pregnancy related issues and they were so understanding. I’m entitled to bereavement leave but I hate asking for more time off. I also don’t want people at work hearing my grandmother died and being all pitying and I’ll just come across heartless because I’m upset about it. I mean I feel really weird and anxious about it but I’m not sad that she died. \n\nDoes that make me a terrible person? My brother thinks we should go to be there for my Dad, that it’s the right thing to do.

            "input": "Okay, for some context, we are both in High school. A few years ago, when we were 13, we were “dating” aka hanging out together after school and during weekends. After three months of our relationship, we shared our first kiss and it all went downhill from there. \n\nAfter our first kiss, he started wanting things from me, specifically sexual favors. He would constantly ask me for a blowjob and I would always refuse. Eventually, he would start pulling his dick out and making me touch it and pleading me to suck it. I was VERY uncomfortable with this, and he managed to convince me that I was a bad girlfriend for refusing to blow him.\n\nHe would also constantly try to touch me, but most of the time, I gave the excuse that I hadn’t shaved down there and he would leave it be. Once though, I did shave before hand, because for some reason, I thought I would be ready. When he came over that day, I realized I wasn’t and told him not to. He shoved his hand down my pants anyway. As. I. Told. Him. No.\nI remember pulling his hand out of my jeans and him brushing it off and smelling his fingers to tell me that I smelt good. I don’t remember what any of the other encounters were that day, just that specific memory.\n\nI was really starting to get into feminism at this point, and joined my junior high’s gay straight alliance. We had this event called the GLSEN Day of Silence where students were supposed to wear black and pledge an oath of silence for the day to protest against bullying and harassment of lgbt+ students. People would ask why I was joining and I wrote down a cute pie chart of how much I felt I was attracted to boys vs. girls and a title that said “I’m Bisexual! :)”.\n\nThis was my first time coming out to any of my friends, and it was the first time I told my Ex. He read the note, looked up at me, read the note again, and then with the face of Joseph when Mary first told him she was pregnant, he said “You’re bi?”.\n\nWe had an argument over FB messenger on the way home from school. He told me he couldn’t date a bi girl because I was more likely to cheat on him. That’s when we broke up.\n\nOver the summer, I met someone new and started a long distance relationship with said person. I was happy with him... then the flashbacks came. I don’t know why, but that memory of my ex shoving his hand down my pants started to constantly play, and I would panic attacks over it. Luckily, my new bf was supportive when I told him what happened and would even call when I’d have panic attacks so I could calm down. \n\n I didn’t tell my parents that it even happened until a year after my ex and I broke up. At the end of 8th grade, I told all of my friends what happened and many took my side (but some still hung out with him afterwards)\n\nRight before Freshman year, I contacted him on social media and we had a nice conversation. He apologized for what he did to me and promised that he would never do that to another girl again.\n\nAnyway, here we are present day.\nLast night, a girl contacted me (Let’s call her A) and told me that her BFF (B) is dating my ex, and she wanted to know if that was the same Ex that had sexually assaulted me. I told her yes, then proceeded to answer any questions she had, as well as tell her my full story.  \nA tells me that B has admitted that my ex does sexual things to her without her consent but she is “okay with it” (A thinks she’s lying). A said that she gets a really bad vibe from my ex, and that she thinks that he may be doing similar things to B.\n\nThat makes my blood boil and want to confront this girl and tell her to break up with him as soon as she can because I don’t want another girl to go through the same trauma that I did!\nBut at the same time, what happened to me happened when we were technically kids, and I don’t feel like it’s my lane to sabotage his relationships. I fear that it will make me seem jealous and I’ll be known as his “crazy ex”\nIdk, should I talk to B? Should I let her know of the monster that her boyfriend was when we were together? Have I slandered his name enough just by telling our friends about what he did to me? Am I an asshole for not putting the whole thing aside  and moving on with my life? \n\n\nTDRL: My “ex boyfriend” sexually assaulted me when we were 13 and now we’re in HS and I suspect that he’s doing the same to another girl even though he told me he wouldn’t. I told our friends about him and part of me feels like I slandered his name enough but the other part of me wants to protect other girls from him.",

She's 34 and I'm 35.\n\nI continued to date her knowing it was risky. I really loved her. So much in common. All that good stuff you hear about good relationships. Yet, she was constantly being shady. Always talking to men behind my back. Would invite them over without my knowledge and hide it from me. She would break up with me temporarily and then claim anything she did was fine because we were broken up.\n\nEventually I couldn't handle it and we went our separate ways.

She consistently said they were just friends and it was okay even if we were dating for them to sleep in her bed because friends.\n\nAnyways. I got laid off from work yesterday. I came to her place and I can't remember exactly what we argued about but she was drunk and it was about a guy I told her to stop flirting with and inviting him over because she tried to sleep with him last time he was there. She kicked me out. She said she was sorry a few hours later but I wasn't having just a simple little I'm sorry. I told her I wanted her to be nicer to me and stop doing this thing with other men.\n\nWell she got drunk that night and had a man come over and she fucked him. I was really upset. Less than 12 hours and she was already fucking someone else. So I called her a slut to her face.

I’m an accountant with plans to move out and go for my masters after saving enough money.\n\n \n\nMy brother has a bit of a rough past so I’ll try to keep it short. About a decade ago, he attended a UC pursuing a major in Chemistry. He lied to our mother about his grades and he ended up dropping out due to his inability to keep them up. This left him with a big ass loan that needed to be paid off and no degree to show for it. At that point, he was forced to work retail. There, he developed a meth addiction and was diagnosed with depression. With years of AA meetings and constant support from our mother, he was able to stay sober for years and was able to find another retail job with better conditions. Fast forward a few years later, he’s traded his addiction to meth with an addiction to junk food. He's a head cashier now, but has no plans of either moving up in the position, or backing down to go back to school.  \n \n\nMy brother and I used to be pretty close. During my college years, we would often bond, watch movies, and go out to eat. During the time however, I would notice things about him that would bother me. I was aware of his situation, so I tried to keep quiet in order to not upset him. One of them being that our mother would always do his laundry. He would also never clean up after himself. He’d never do the dishes. In fact, sometimes he’d just leave his dishes on the counter. He never did any chores either because he would always be too tired. He's extremely pessimistic and aloof about every single thing. He's also very prideful. Whenever my mother would try to offer some advice, he would straight up yell at her. He constantly complains about how tiring his job is and claims that one day he’ll quit or step down so he can go back to school despite showing absolutely zero signs of doing so. Whenever he’s home, 90% of the time he’s asleep. This kept up for about 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I eventually snapped at him about his behavior. It became this full blown argument which ultimately ended with him calling me a condescending asshole. Since then, I’ve stopped communicating with him. This caused me to stop eating junk food with him. After a few weeks, I lost like 10 lbs alone just from not spending time with him. This motivated me to lose even more weight. It's been a year since I've stopped all communication with him. I’ve lost around 100 lbs. and I’m no longer obese or pre-diabetic. Our mother has always been worried about me and brother’s health so she's delighted with this change. Not only that, but ever since I’ve called him out for it, my brother has been doing his own laundry and has started to wash his dishes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a childish asshole for not wanting to speak with my older brother anymore? I feel like we're both better off just not associating with one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

During my four years at this college there have been a number of reports of random people in the dorms. Some of these people would do things like: Steal, peak in on the girls bathroom, walk into peoples rooms, and sleep in the lounges. One of the big rules they tell us every year is to NOT let people you do not know into the dorms. I take this rule seriously because I would never know who I was letting in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to what happened this night. While waiting in the entrance to the dorm for my friend so we could go out to get something to eat. A guy (we will call him David) walks up to the front door and tried to open it. Now the doors are electronically locked and you need a fob to get in. David then starts pounding on the glass of the door to get my attention. I look up at him, but turn around and walk the other direction. David then starts pounding even harder on the glass. At this point his (I'm guessing) girlfriend lets him into the dorm. David then walks up to me, and starts yelling about letting him into the dorm. I look at him saying that I do not know him, why would I let him in? David then shows me a Tupperware container saying \"Yeah I look like threat.\" He then says that I should let him in because he was \"freezing his ass off\" outside. For some context it is about 5 degrees out right now, but he was not out there for more than a couple of minutes. David then turns around and walks off with his girlfriend into the stairwell. During that time he was calling me an asshole and a \"inconsiderate jerk.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for not letting him into my dorm?",

Pre-kids, my husband and I had decided that we weren't going to do the whole Santa tradition.  What we didn't plan for was how hard Santa would be pushed in school (small town in an area that's 99.999% culturally Christian). Lots of Facebook posts from classmates' parents about not letting kids who stopped believing in Santa spoiling the magic for those who still believed.  The thing is, my daughter has absolutely no chill and can't keep a secret.  So when my daughter started talking about Santa and believing in him, we reluctantly decided to play along just enough to keep her from being the a-hole that \"ruins\" Christmas for her preschool class. \n\nFast forward to a few days before Christmas.  We go to a family function and within minutes of arriving my 5 year old niece tells my daughter that Santa isn't real.  Daughter asks me if it's true,  so I ask her what she thinks.  Daughter replies that she thinks he's real and crisis averted.  But later at the gathering, my brother-in-law (that niece's dad) boasts about how they don't do myths at their house.  It seems that when niece learned the truth, she wasn't taught that some people prefer to be kept in the dark.  I say nothing to niece or brother-in-law about it. After all, if I don't expect my daughter to be able to keep a secret, I can't expect her cousin who only a few months older to keep one either. And everyone has the right the raise their kids as they see fit.\n\nBut I'm feeling annoyed about the whole thing.   Both at being peer pressured into a tradition that we  didn't really care to do and for not getting the same consideration from our brother-in-law that we were trying to give to others.  So I'm sure I'm an asshole for being a hypocrite.  But I'm also wondering if parents who want you to lie and pretend to keep up a tradition that you don't follow are the assholes.

Several months prior to that his ex gf of 9 yrs lost her house due to not paying mortgage because she had a friend living there who signed for the postal delivered foreclosure papers but never gave them to the exgf. She lost the house &amp; desperately needed to live somewhere w her 15 yr old son(not his) &amp; was broke, although very highly educated. \n\nAlthough they were broken up for a year then &amp; he even had another relationship, he let her move in not charging rent. He even loaned her $12k+ for remedial mortgage fees.He pretty much knew he never would get it back.\n\nSo he meets me &amp; we're in love but wont even drive me past his house for fear she'd see us. Wimp. We dated &amp; had our trysts in his van for 8 months. But I loved him &amp; mostly accepted it with occasional all out screaming matches about why he was too wimpy to ask her to leave. She had a few excuses of people who promised her a place but then these fell thru last minute. \n\nJune 2018 shes gone &amp; I finally move in. I had to beg him practically bc I had to sell my home &amp; couldnt afford 2000+ rental fees while disabled. He charges me $700 rent monthly. Its been very ugly &amp; I have deep resentment over how he made me feel like \"first runner up\" while she kicked back in his million dollar home. \n\nHis mom still friendly w her &amp; I think gives her handouts. I heard mom &amp; ex had a christmas lunch. I went to Moms today &amp; saw displayed a pic of the kid in the living room &amp; I silently abandoned my half eaten breakfast &amp; quietly left. He knew it was bc if the kid pic displayed. Mom doesnt know ex gf owes him $12k &amp; he told me NOT to tell her. Mom would be very pissed. AITA for being pissed at this scenario? Thanks guys. ",

My aunt raised me since I was 3 and we lived with her now ex husband till a few years ago when they divorced. She has epilepsy and has seizures pretty commonly. She hasn't worked in 2 years and has no income other then alamony which runs out in March.

Now time is pretty close and she still isn't putting effort in to find work but rather waits for me to get home with her car from work and goes out and returns the next morning most times. Now most days she spends sitting on my couch scrolling on her phone and watching TV that's it never any cleaning or job searching. She makes very poor financial decisions like leavin lights on 24/7 I'm not kidding all day lights and the TV will be on all the time . The days she has a seizure she will sleep and in and I will take care of her and the dog and cats. Yesterday she slept all day and because of that I had to stay home on my day off to take care of things. Now today I get home and shes all dressed up and getting ready to go out with her ex husband. Nothing has been done around the house even remotely in fact she just left her dirty dishes on the coffee table. Now I've lost my shit before and she always just cuts me off and stops arguing with me stopping all talks and will just ignore me when I try to bring it up to her.

She has seizures which makes it hard for her to find work I understand that.

She pooped in the car while leaving the house, so we rushed back in to change her and inadvertently left her blanket there.\n\nWe parked a block away from the restaurant, I held her close to my chest and covered her with half of my jacket . As my wife and I were walking to the restaurant an older Chinese man looked in shock, pointed at my daughter and then at me. He told me “That baby needs more clothes!” I responded that she’s fine. She was actually in 3 layers: a body suit, a cardigan and a fleece onesie. I live in the Bay Area, so it was maybe mid 50’s. I stood near the doorway trying to look to see where my parents were sitting, when the old guy came up to me and said, “She is not fine, she’s too cold. She will get sick” I told him I didn’t ask for his opinion and to mind his own business. My wife found my parents and started to walk towards them and I followed, the old guy then gasped and essentially said “ABC (American born Chinese) kid doesn’t know anything.”\n\nAfter finishing dim sum with my folks, I told them what happened. They were shocked and told me that’s not how I treat elder folk. My wife came to my defense and said people shouldn’t butt into other people’s business. This was actually like the 5th time a random Asian elder made a comment about our parenting. 4 of the times they commented that my daughter “looked too cold” and the other time one woman commented that “she looks hungry, mom needs to feed her.”\n\nMy Dad said that “well if you saw a child in danger you would speak up too.” I told him, yeah but my daughter wasn’t even close to being “in danger” and he said maybe you need to bundle her up cause it’s cold outside. I just told him he was wrong and I told him many times already she’s getting over a really bad heat rash. (Long story, but essentially her room was too hot and needed to wear less layers at night).\n\nMy parents just told me to be more considerate and not be rude to older people. I just shrugged and that was that.\n\nAITA for telling off an old man that made a comment on my parenting?",

It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.\n\nWas I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?

A friend of mine was flicking through my planner and found out that I recently had another attempt. \n\nFor some context, she and I have bonded about our mental health issues before, so she might want to be updated about these things. She also comes to me often when she’s not doing so well, and trusts me enough to tell me about her attempts and episodes. The only issue is I’m not close enough to her to tell her about all my numerous suicide attempts and etc, and also didn’t think it was a big deal. I also didn’t really want it to be spread around, and she has a tendency of telling our other friends want happened, because she thinks “they deserve to know.”\n\nWhen she confronted me, she texted me: “I saw your planner. Why don’t you ever tell us [she and our other friends] about this shit? Why don’t you talk to us? We just want to help you”\n\nMe: “I’m okay now, don’t worry! I just didn’t want to tell lots of people.

            "input": "I know at first glance of the title it seems obvious that, yeah, this is an asshole move. Even I was convinced that I was, in fact, The Asshole at first, but as the night went on I began to have my doubts.  So here's what happened.\n\nLast week a big group went out for a coworker's birthday.  We have a pretty tightknit crew at my job, and there's a big group of us that goes out almost every Friday rain or shine.  The birthday boy is a regular part of that crew.  The person who planned his birthday outing is not, but she works closely with Birthday Boy and wanted to do something nice.  She's old enough to be most of Regular Crew's mom, and is friendly enough, (or so I thought?), though can be a bit sassy.  I've never had an issue before. I like her! I still do, I think, this incident nonwithstanding.  Anyway. She plans an outing into the city to go to dinner.  She asked if I wanted to come a couple weeks before, because she wants to get a number for a reservation.  I say of course, I'll be there with bells on.  Sounds cute.  She does follow up several times, to make sure she has the right number for the reservation.\n\nFast forward to the day of the event. As I'm getting ready to leave work, a couple buddies in Regular Crew ask if I'm going to this party.  I say yeah and ask if they want to ride together.  They do. It's me and three others in my car.  \n\nWhen we arrive, Party Planner gives me side eye so hard I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.  As the evening goes on, she continues to make a show of acting visibly annoyed.  One of the people I ride with ask me what her name is.  That's when I put two and two together and realize that the three Regular Crew buddies I brought don't know Party Planner.  They were not on her guestlist.  Considering they were already aware of the party, and that they are friends with Birthday Boy, it didn't even occur to me that they wouldn't be part of the official count.  I pull someone closer to Party Planner aside and ask if she's angry with me.  Party Planner's friend says that while she personally thinks \"the more the merrier,\" yes, it's me Party Planner is upset with and maybe I should say something. \n\nI should mention that there are probably about thirty of us here, and while we do have a private room, it's very cramped.  The waitstaff doesn't bat an eye and whips out a couple more chairs, and we all scoot in and get cozy.  But at my first opportunity, as people shuffle around and a chair opens up next to Party Planner, I sit next to her and say, \"Hey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to throw off your plan or anything,\" and without looking up at me, all she says is, \"I'm annoyed.\"  Yes, I'm thinking, you've made that very clear. I'm kind of at a loss for words that she wouldn't just brush it off and say \"no big deal,\" and I awkwardly retreat back to my friends.  She continues acting bothered down at her end of the table, and apparently not being shy about rude she thinks I am to her friends at that end.  \n\nThe night goes on and people are starting to get rowdy.  I'm not one of the people on a mission to get absolutely twisted, but I have had a few.  I see Party Planner not talking to anyone, and I ask if she's having a good time.  She responds \"Not as good as I could have.\"  Reddit, I am shook at this point! I thought a few drinks in and it would all just be smooth sailing. Everyone seems to be having a good time but her, and do feel bad about that, since she planned this and was really excited to hang out with everyone.  But again, I don't know what to say to her response.  I'm regretting going out of my way to talk to her again, feeling like maybe I rubbed salt in a wound. I confide in Birthday Boy that I am feeling like The Asshole, and he says don't be ridiculous, he's glad the people I brought are there, and that there are a bunch of random coworkers he never even talks to there, and it would be weird if those people were invited but the Regular Crew homies that just happen to not know Party Planner weren't.  \n\nAfter a few hours, Party Planner and the other older coworkers start filtering out, I suppose because they have lives and kids and stuff.  The rest of us young jawns go to a bar down the street that has a lot more standing room, and enjoy each other's company well into the night.  I do hear from someone at some point that Party Planner left in tears.  The person who informed me of this was of the perspective that Party Planner felt neglected and unappreciated when she left.  But at this point I'm kind of over it, and think that if you're going to go out of your way to act miserable, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to sit next to you at a party.  \n\nSo thanks for reading my long-winded ass story, y'all.  I await your judgement and will gladly accept whatever outcome I get.",

            "input": "So. A lot of context is necessary to understand why I was so upset to begin with. I don’t tell many people that I have a disability that basically makes everything I feel extremely intense, sadness, happiness, everything. I get upset a lot because of it and I don’t want people feeling bad because they didn’t technically do anything so I normally never say anything. I also hate using my disability as an excuse but it is important to mention in this story.\n\nWhat’s also important to mention is that I spent three months in an extremely abusive relationship prior to moving to university. I never did anything about the relationship because I was convinced that I was over reacting due to my disability and my manipulative partner told me the same.\n\nA friend of mine, let’s call him weeb, knee all of the above. He was someone I trusted a lot and he knew and the insides and out. \n\nWe were at the bar and I was alone at the table while everyone else was playing pool. I didn’t know how to play pool so I didn’t want to humiliate myself by going up there. Another friend of mine (let’s call this one memes) came up to me and asked why I was sitting alone and I explained. They said that I should come up anyway so I did. I went up and joined in on a great conversation. It was a blast.\n\nBut that’s when Weeb told me to move out of the way of the pool stick thing. So I did. Then he asked me to move more when I was clearly out of range of it (unless home runs are a thing in pool?). So he says “go away, you’re not wanted” and he pushed me so hard that I still have a bruise from where he touched me.\n\nI got really upset by this. He knew everything that I had been through. He knew how many times I had been pushed down a set of stairs. He knew how much I was hit, and kicked and everything. He knew. I went to the ladies and I cried. I didn’t want to make a thing out of it because I often over react to everything and it’s just easier to hide. That way the only feelings that are hurt are mine.\n\nThen another friend came in, let’s call him cloud. I was really surprised that he came into the ladies as he was transitioning. Coming back into the ladies must have been really upsetting for him but he wanted to console me. I was very thankful for that. I told him what happened and the context in which it happens (as vaguely as possible - I didn’t want to name names and I didn’t want to go into the exact depths of my abuse). \n\nCloud told me that I should go and speak to whoever upset me and talk to them about it. So I did... just not the way that Cloud recommended.\n\nI walked up to Weeb who was at the bar ordering more drinks with memes and I aggressively ask him “was there really a need to push me that hard” and Weeb says “I didn’t even touch you”. I responded with “but you did” and he rolls his eyes and turned away from me. I got so offended, Memes and I made contact and he had “oh teas gonna spill eyes”. \n\nI turned away and just sat by myself for the rest of the evening. When we were saying goodbyes I hugged everyone but Weeb and I said to Weeb “we need to talk when we’re sober” and he gave me major stink eye as he said “do we”. I said “yes we do.” And I walked home alone at 2am.\n\nAITA for aggressively confronting someone about something personal in front of their best friend?",

I was seeing this girl for a solid few months (in this environment, people tend to build relationships very quickly). \n\nAnyway, we called it off shortly before Christmas because she wanted to carry the relationship on once we left this particular hostel and I was a little more realistic, as we obviously have different plans to travel round Australia. \n\nOnce we both arrive back in the hostel after the festive period, we both missed each other and realised we want to carry things on together, even if it means changing our individual travel plans. It turns out she got both her nipples pierced whilst she was away. She asked my friends (one of them including one of my best friends who I came out here with) if they wanted to see her new nipple piercings, and he (amongst others) said yes. \n\nSo she showed them this entirely topless photo showing her complete upper torso. When she told me she asked if they all wanted to see it, and they all said yes, I felt angry/upset that all my friends have seen a potential girlfriend’s tits. \n\nAITA for being upset/angry at this? It’s making me question if I want to carry on seeing this girl and I’m also annoyed at my friends for saying yes they wanted to see her nipple piercings? (In my opinion, just an excuse to see her tits).

We often talk about marriage and kids and our future. \n\nWhen it comes to wedding rings, I hate the idea and the tradition. The absurdity and immorality of the diamond industry and how it became a tradition from tricky marketing makes me sick. I feel that many men feel that they HAVE to buy an expensive rock to show their love but that is absurd. IMO buying an expensive diamond ring means I'm buying into everything about the industry that disgusts me. \n\nMy SO desires a nice wedding ring, and it has been a dream of hers for a long time. Bringing up my distaste for the tradition always leads to an awkward fight, and now we cant talk about it at all without her saying she doesn't want to talk about it. She knows very shallowly from my rantings about the industry, but she doesn't care enough to not want one. \n\nI have talked about the idea of synthetic diamonds, but she is not interested and wants the real deal. She has came back and said she would be fine with synthetic for the band, but she wants a decent sized real diamond in the middle, something around the 2k to 4k range. This boggles my mind as that money could be a downpayment on a house, kids college money, exploring the world, etc. Why waste it on a little rock that I morally do not agree with? \n\nI'm not asking anyone to put down my GFs beliefs as I know a lot of people has distaste with diamonds. I get where she is coming from, a lot of girls dream of the real deal fancy ring their man will get them one day. I just choke up thinking about actually putting that cash on a single ring. \n\nAITA for not wanting to ever waste money on an expensive diamond wedding ring? I would do anything for this girl, but just giving up and doing the deed only confirms my thoughts that men are trapped into buying into a shitty industry. ",

            "input": "Long post, tl;dr at the bottom. Don't know if this is the correct subreddit, please let me know. Sorry for ambiguous title, let me know a better one so I can improve my posts.\n\nContext: my gf (25f) and me (27m) have been together since her first year of university. I was her first sexual partner, she was my second. She had a bf before me in highschool, but they never had sex.\n\nLet me first sketch the context and then I'll get to my dilemma.\n\nThrough the years, a few things happened that pushed my gf in some kind of depression. She went out a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot. Eventually, her mom and me convinced her to go see a therapist, which helped a lot. She got through it a few years ago.\n\nHowever, during this period of depression, she got drunk once and kissed another guy. She confessed the next day, we got into a fight but I found it in myself to forgive her. She told me that part of her was sad that she never had a truly wild period because she met me so early on and this also influenced her action.\n\nAnother thing about my gf is that she can be either really passionate about friends or not at all, and that she easily becomes friends with guys. She always kept me in the loop and told me if she was feeling attracted to other guys. I also sometimes feel attracted to other girls, but we don't act upon it so that's fine. These tight friendships usually only last a couple of months after which they sizzle down, either to regular friendships or to just acquaintances. A few guys are also friends with me who I trust so I am 99% sure nothing happened.\n\nCue to last year. During the summer, she met a guy while she was on holiday while I had to work. She became tight friends, and when she got home she told me about him. During the next month, she is texting him a lot, which isn't that unusual but every time I glanced at her phone when she was near me, she would turn away or close her phone. I mentioned this to her and she claimed that she doesn't like being checked and that she always does that. I admit that I only noticed it because I was already feeling a bit suspicious, so maybe that part was true.\n\nA week or so, my suspicions had grown a lot and I took the low road: I checked her phone (I know, asshole move). In their texts, he talked about how he loves her and she talked about missing him. She said that she liked him more than she wanted, but that they could never be a couple because she is together with me and she didn't want to give up a 7 year relationship for a fling. I only read a bit since my emotions were acting up, but I am 100% sure they didn't have sex since she told him she doesn't want to. I don't actually know if they kissed, she said no but I don't know if I can trust her. We got into a huge fight, but in the end I decided to let things cool of. The fight came up again and I said that I don't trust her completely anymore, she admitted that she still regrets never having a fling or sex with another man. In the end we decided to split up for 2 months and see where we stand afterwards. Since this is such a big issue for her I don't think we'll get through it if I don't at least let her experience what single life as an adult is like. She told me I am also free to do what I want, it doesn't bother her according to her. I don't have any interest but she sounded sincere at least. I told her I don't know how I'll react and that's a risk she is going to have to take.\n\nWe are currently 1 month into the break (insert Ross gif). I am still not trusting her again completely, and I am not sure I ever will. The thing is, I still love her very much and find it hard to imagine life without her. The reason for my trust issues is that I am an insecure person and I am afraid she will either fall really in love with the guy from holiday or find someone else that she loves more than me. I know that can happen with anyone, regardless of context and history, but I can't get over this feeling it seems. I'm trying to, maybe I can someday, but maybe not.\n\nI know I have only told my side of the story. I know I am a quiet person and not very passionate about anything (just who I am, maybe autistic traits but never tested). I do try to show her I love her but she does accuse me of never coming up with or organizing something exciting. I'm not an entrepreneur while she comes from a family of self employed, I just work my job and that's enough for me. I don't really make big plans for the appartment, she usually does. I know this makes me a bit boring while  she is usually in charge of the fun stuff unless it's meeting up with friends, we organize easily in that matter. On the other hand I'm reliable and there for her when she needs me or my help. I mostly put her first when deciding on my schedule or drop plans if she needs me. Bottom line is that we both have our merits and flaws, I don't want to break her down.\n\nWIBTA for waiting for another month hoping I can trust her again or is that unfair to her or to myself? Should I talk to her about this?\n\nExtra: WIBTA for asking her to let me go through their texts again as this could be an easy way to confirm I can trust her?\n\nSorry for rambling, I'm too close to the situation to think clearly.\n\nTl;dr gf of 7 years has history of emotional attachment with close guy friends, she developed a crush on the last one. Currently on a break because she hid it and I don't know what happened between them (100% no sex though) which is making it hard to start trusting her again. Might be an asshole for the way I am handling it.",

I didn’t think I’d ever talk with Maya, but we were put in a group project together, and soon started to talk with each other. We didn’t exactly become best friends, but did hang out with each other some lunches.\n\nFast forward a bit to Monday, my other friend, Helen decided to hang out with us. Helen is quite shy, and does have anxiety, but she is a really good person to be friends with. While talking in a our group about people we didn’t particularly like, Helen brought up that she actually used to be in Maya’s friend group last year in middle school. She told us that Maya would constantly harass her, by showing/sending her nudes/gross pictures, reading out sexual stuff to her, making remarks about her body (She’s around 5’0, while I’m 5’6) and calling her a ‘vampire’ because she’s quite pale. Helen would even go as far as to skip school just to get away from her. When I asked if she and Maya were on good terms now, Helen said that she never apologized for what she did to her, which made me angry.\n\nI haven’t talked to Maya since Monday, and when she asked what was wrong, I told her that she should be ashamed of herself for what she did to Helen. She told me that she doesn’t care, and that it shouldn’t matter because it was a year ago. I said back to her that it doesn’t matter, and that it still made Helen uncomfortable while she was around her. Maya said that I was just over reacting, and I didn’t have to be such a bitch to her the past couple of days.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n(Sorry for any spelling errors)",

            "input": "(This is my first post here, tell me if I do something wrong)\n\nSome context: \n\nMy birthday is right around christmas, and so usually my family combines both of those celebrations to get me one gift per year (I'm only 17, turning 18 soon, and so I live with both my parents). I know, it already sucks enough.\n\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\n\nNow to get into the story:\n\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \n\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\n\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\n\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \n\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \n\nThis receives no reply.\n\nI then say \"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\"\n\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\n\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \n\nFor the cherry on top:\n\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\n\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\n\nHere's to the new year. \n\nP.S. The reason this is even a post is because of how convinced my dad is that he is right. Maybe there is something I'm missing.\n\n",

Nobody can get a peep out of me once my flashbacks start. \n\nfast forward a few minutes after she stops yelling, and I manage to quell my flashbacks enough to pass off ownership of the server, and I leave.

            "input": " I've been with my wife for almost 4 years. We have one child together, and she's pregnant with our second. She's a great mother and partner, and I love her to death. She is currently about 8 months pregnant. She has gestational diabetes, so she is forced to eat a diabetic diet and check her blood sugars.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she has been on and off about eating healthy and checking her sugars. She was very busy with work and school during the first trimester, so she primarily ate fast food between classes, etc and didn't check her sugar. I didn't really find out about her diet until later on when she said she was too busy/stressed to eat healthy.\n\nI try to do everything I can to help and be supportive. I almost always have a diabetic-friendly dinner made for when she gets home and lunches packed for her. If she is out running errands and hungry, I tell her to text me before she gets home and I'll make sure there's healthy food ready for her. I also do the majority of our cleaning to keep her from being stressed. In my mind, we're in the pregnancy together, and I want to do everything I can to help keep her and our baby healthy.\n\nFor awhile, she was rarely taking her blood sugar. She was busy, stressed, and I think the pregnancy emotions were making things very difficult. After eating fast food (5 months pregnant), she came back home and I told her she really needs to take her blood sugar. She was annoyed, but took it to basically appease me. It was almost 300. For those unaware, those are dangerous levels. She took that as a reality check and started to manage her gestational diabetes better.\n\nShe finished school around 6 months. For the next couple months, AFAIK, she was doing better. The other day (8 months pregnant), she came home with fast food. I asked her why she didn't message me to make her food—she said she didn't think about it. I don't expect her to be perfect, so I just asked her to please take her blood sugar in an hour so we can manage it through exercise or whatever if necessary.\n\nAn hour passes by, I remind her, ask her if she wants me to get her supplies for her, etc. She said no she'll get it. Another 20 minutes passes, she said she is busy scheduling appointments. I told her I would literally bring it right to her since blood sugar is time-sensitive, and that her health is more important, but she needs to take it. She throws her papers in the air, yells that I'm annoying and nagging, and storms out of the house.\n\nI can see how it can be perceived as nagging, but it's not only her health, it's also our daughter's. It's frustrating because I'm completely reliant on her actions—all I can do is try to make sure we have healthy food available and ready. We had a rough last pregnancy (ended up fine and healthy). So far through her appointments, everything has looked okay, but I'm still nervous about the birth.\n\nAm I nagging? Should I just let her do her thing and not worry so much? Or is she out of line getting pissed at me?",

I cook as many healthy dishes as I can, we measure and weigh all of his portions at home, and we've even dished out hundreds on personal trainers for him to try and help him get more active, but our efforts have not helped him at all. \n\n\n\nAll that being said, we give all of our children a $25 a week allowance for helping out around the house. While it may not be much, it usually covers anything they may want to do with friends, and of course they are free to save up if they choose. Recently however, it just dawned on us just how much of that money is going to my son's fast food habit: every single cent. We found a bunch of receipts he left lying around after cleaning out his backpack that showed us he eats out almost every single day!\n\n\n\nAfter confirming with him that this was all true, my husband and I decided to cut him off. He wouldn't have to help out if he didn't want to around the house anymore, but we aren't giving him an allowance anymore. We told him that at his age, if he wants to ruin his body then he can do it on his own dime by finding a job. \n\n\n\nThat said, obviously until he does so we aren't actually going to cut him off. If his friends are going out, we'll give him a few bucks, we just don't want him to have the means of eating out as often as he does.\n\n\n\nAnyways, this has been a cause of a whole bunch of arguing in the house. He's saying he's too busy  with school, and that it's unfair that he gets nirbinfi while his siblings  still get an allowance, so if you have any opinions on this, please let me know! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I thought it was no big deal, we had plenty of food and drinks to go around.\n\nIt was about 20 minutes in when I noticed this guy standing around awkwardly. So I asked if everything was alright, and he said yes. He said that no one was talking to him. So I talked with him for a moment, learned more about him.

I asked what’s up, and he said no one was talking to him.\n\nI asked where my friend was, and he just shrugged. I suggested that he join a game of uno going on, but he refused. I suggested he mingle, and he also refused.\n\nNow this is where I started to get annoyed. He says no one is talking to him, despite the fact that he was being talked to earlier. And he says no one is talking to him, when he can go up to someone and say “Hi”. At this point, I’m starting to see what’s going on; he just wants to feel sorry for himself, or he wants everyone else to drop what they’re doing and make him feel less awkward. So I told him that if he’s just going to stand around, he can leave. He did, and I let his friend (my coworker) know.  She said it was shitty to tell him to leave, but I explained that he wasn’t making the effort to socialize with others, and I didn’t have time to drag him around to make him talk to people.

We have weekly chores that we are all assigned, and the general rule is to wash your dishes within the day you use them. \n\nOn Tuesday, we noticed one housemate (let's call them Housemate A) had not done their dishes in a while. They were starting to pile up and they hadn't been washed out (there was food stuck to them). I had seen an ant in the apartment earlier so I sent a message to the group chat, asking everyone to remember to do their dishes within 1-2 days to avoid bugs. Housemate A responded, saying they could probably not do the stack of dishes until the weekend. They said they were busy since they had 4 midterms, and had no time. I was a little peeved but I told them that I understood they were busy.   \nFast forward to Thursday night, and the dishes were still not done. There was a dead fly in one of the cups, the plates and bowls were not rinsed out, and they were starting to smell. It was so gross. One of the housemates and I started complaining to each other in the kitchen, just saying that we were grossed out, and it was incredibly annoying that Housemate A had left them this long, *especially when we have a dishwasher*. Said nothing bad about them as a person, but we expressed our general annoyance and exasperation with the situation. \n\nThe next morning, we wake up to see that the housemate has posted a long rant on their Snapchat about people they trusted talking behind her back, talking shit, etc. We realized that they probably heard us discussing the dish situation the previous night before. They posted all these quotes about how people are quick to criticize but never congratulate them on their accomplishments -- just generally really passive-aggressive stuff. I feel bad for complaining to my other housemate, but I also don't think they should have left their dishes that long when we have a dishwasher. It's been three days and they have yet to say a word to me or the other housemate; it's pretty obvious they are ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder.

I kept telling her that uh, no, I'm actually trans, and that isn't how it works. She didn't believe me, and started insisting I see a different therapist to get a \"second opinion\" on my own gender identity. She also tried to keep me from seeing my current therapist, who specializes in working with LGBT people and who I've seen for 3+ years, because she wasn't asking these questions and was just \"encouraging it\". At one point she even considered talking to my doctor to try and take me off my hormone replacements, which I've been taking for over two years.\n\nI was a complete wreck. I had never felt so betrayed in my life. Dramatic as it sounds, it felt like I didn't even know my mom anymore. Every time I tried to talk to her about this it ended with me leaving the room in tears. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if I was independent, but because of debilitating anxiety issues I have to rely on my mom for a lot, and she was basically trying to cut me off from the things that had been helping me the most for years. I was terrified.\n\nThis goes on for a few weeks, and then as soon as it started, it stopped. I was relieved but extremely confused, because at first my mom refused to tell me anything. After I kept pushing for answers she finally told me that a friend of hers had been influencing her and putting harmful transphobic ideas in her head, and my mom believed them. She finally snapped out of it because she saw how it was affecting me and didn't want our relationship to be ruined because of something like this.\n\nAnd, well, I'm having trouble forgiving her. I was really hurt by all of this and I felt like a huge amount of trust had been broken. I'm constantly questioning how much she actually accepts me and I'm afraid to be as open with her as I used to. Plus, she trusted the words of somebody who doesn't even support trans people over mine. She understands why I'm not over it, but she's also kind of pushing me to \"move on, it's over\". Should I just forgive and forget? I want to believe nothing like this would happen again, but I was led to believe that nothing like this would have happened in the first place, so I don't know.\n\nI suppose on the bright side, my mom's looking into family therapists for the two of us to talk to, so hopefully that'll do some good.",

Tried to be friendly but feel like he doesn't give me the opportunity. \n\nApparently I'm a wuss and afraid of confrontation, so I left him a note on his door that said exactly the following: \"Please be considerate of your neighbors when coming home after 12am. Have a lot of early mornings. No hate, just would appreciate it. Thank you :)\" \n\nAnd yes, I did draw a smiley face lol. I really didn't want this to get ugly with someone I have to live next to. \n\nThen I popped some meditation music into some headphones.

At ME. \n\nI'm also not sure what he's talking about when he says that, I'm an extremely boring neighbor and don't even have people over because I live in a tiny studio apartment, lol. I try so hard to be undetectable. \n\nI actually thought I had left him the note after people had left as to not embarrass him, but it turns out there was still one person still left over.

I work M-F and am off weekends, so I requested Thurs, Fri, and Mon off of work so that I can pack Thursday, drive Friday, concert Saturday, drive home Sunday. I took Monday off to relax at home before work again. I put in this request at the end of November and my Supervisor approved it. Now, my department is made up of just me and my supervisor at the moment, as work is slow and corporate has recently deemed we didn't need to hire a replacement for a co-worker that left in October. We are the only 2 people that can do what we do, but have been able to manage with just one of us for recent vacations.\nThis past Monday, my supervisor says to me:\n\nSupervisor: I forgot to tell you! I hate BSB but I'm going to one of their concerts.\n\nMe: Oh, nice. Where?\n\nS: Hershey Park.\n\nM: How funny, that's the day after my BSB concert. Do you plan on going to the park?\n\nS: maybe saturday. My friend really loves BSB and was sad tickets were so expensive nearby so this weekend her and some friends decided to buy tickets to Hershey because they were way cheaper. And I decided why the hell not, and have a girls trip. My friends got floor seats for around $300 which i didn't want to pay so I got seats in the 300 level for around $50, but I'll walk around to visit them. I told the manager that I'll be needing that Monday off.\n\nM: Oh, well I already requested that Monday off and you approved it, so...\n\nS: I'll be 4 hours away so I don't know how I'll be back in time for work Monday\n\nM: I'll be 6 hours away, so... *blink, blink*\n\nS: I'm sure we can figure something out by then. It's 4 months away. \n\nSo after that little exchange, I made sure to go to our manager and explain that the day my Supervisor told her she needed off, I had already requested and was approved for. Just in case things couldn't be \"worked out.\"\n\nAITA if I refuse to give up my Monday off because my supervisor decided to schedule a trip and buy tickets before making sure the day was available?",

Our mom got diagnosed with cancer after 6 months and 2 years later she died. I still live alone in the other country.\n\nHer illness had different effects on the both of us. I had a lot of time with my mother and it allowed me to make peace with our limited time, but my life became really hard since I had to do a lot on my own and don't have a family near me that can support me, I am over stressed and am in the process of dropping out of (high?) school.\n\nI imagine that our moms death came fast for Rachel, but her life seems stable enough. I do know that she has a lot of emotional trouble, not a lot of friends and has problems with my father (he has the tendency to always complain about our mother, hurray) but she is economically supported and is encouraged to discover the world. She has one more year to go before she finishes college.\n\nPeople always had the tendency to compare us (as any other siblings) but it was terrible last summer. Rachel seemed reasonable happy, was having fun and just generally in a good mood, while I didn’t know who I was anymore, felt like a complete and utter failure and I thought daily about commiting suicide. People saw that I wasn’t happy and wanted to cheer me up by pointing out how Rachel and I are the same. It only made me feel worse since the things they said weren’t correct.\n\nFast forward 2-3 months, I made it a point to concentrate on myself and find my own passions / hobbies (Rachel and I shared a lot of hobbies when we were younger) and do something that made me feel like my own person and not just a worse version of Rachel. I became interested in cooking and started to experiment more. November comes and I finally find something that I really like, cocktails.\n\nI got excited since it was almost my birthday and I would finally be allowed to buy alcohol at the liquor store (drinking age here is 18 but you can’t buy anything above 3,5% until 20). I am looking up ingredients, shakers, types of alcohol etc. and deciding how to collect my own bar. I spoke about this new interest / hobby / passion with my dad and he seemed happy that I found something that really sparked joy for me.\n\nSo I finally found a shaker that I liked this week but I have to wait until end of this month or next month to make sure that I can afford to order it, I inform my dad that I found ‘the one’ and show him the picture. His reaction?\n\n‘Nice, I gave one to Rachel for her birthday.’\n\nI have the tendency to be jealous of Rachel, since dad had the habit to treat her better than me in general when we were younger. These kind of actions don't help.\n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed of that he gave my sister a present for her birthday that I wanted to buy myself for my birthday and?  \nNote: I am disappointed that my present feels ruined, but I am not angry at Rachel.",

I told her this and she got upset and we had a whole fight over it a couple of days ago. It was resolved mostly, and now today she again asked if I would have dinner with her tonight. Obviously, my answer was the same thing. She told me things like “it says a lot about a person how they act when you’re sick” and that I’m choosing a “5% chance of a cough over hanging out with her before i leave for training” and when I challenged that, she said she won’t argue about it and will see me in a few days. \n\nI get that she was really attentive when I was sick and I appreciate that, but it feels like she’s assuming I should act the same way regardless of circumstance.

Don't get me wrong, if she doesn't want to go into politics, that's one thing.

I had been wanting to be out of the relationship for over a year, but was always somehow reeled back in, gaslighted and manipulated. About 1 year into dating my ex (21M), I met an amazing guy. We really hit it off and became amazing friends- or at least that was my take on it. All my friends and even sometimes myself did have an idea that he was into me, but obviously nothing could have been said or done because of my relationship. \n\nSo I keep getting to know this guy, and started to develop some feelings for him. Things were not going well in my relationship, but I still felt really guilty to be having feelings for someone else, so I just ignored it and pushed all of that aside. \n\nFast forward to now. About one year after meeting this guy i’ve been getting close with. I finally ended my relationship and have been feeling amazing. Haven’t really been looking for anything. Me and the “friend” guy are still close and one night he started sending me flirty texts. We ended up talking about how we felt and he admitted to having feelings for me ever since we met, about a year ago. I told him that I felt something for him too. \n\nSo here’s the problem: he’s been in a “situation” with another girl for going on 5 months now. He’s talked to me about it a lot since we have been so close. Basically he doesn’t want to get super serious with her, even though it’s clear that she wants a defined relationship. So it seems they want different things, but they still hang out a lot. This guy seems to be pursuing me, and honestly I’m super into it. But he did mention to me one day that if that girl knew me and him were talking about this kind of stuff she would be pissed. So he’s being dishonest with her about what he’s been thinking about with me. Not sure how I feel about that either. \n\nBut WIBTA if I went along with his advances? I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes here but also could really see me and this guy going well together, and maybe even just having fun right now, who knows. \n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I went along with the pursuits of my good friend who is talking to/ has a situation with another girl? Me and him\nare into each other and she isn’t aware of any talks me and him have had about our feelings. But the guy is being super forward with me about wanting to hang out and see where things go.

Doesn't insult me, occasionally pays for dinner (he's a student), says he loves me, etc. But he doesn't always take no for an answer. For example, on Friday he was over at my place. We were spooning in my bed watching tv and he tried to put his hand up my shirt to rest on my stomach. I said no and pushed his hand. He fought me back and clearly didn't care that I didn't want his hand there. Once it was settled on my stomach where I didn't want it he asked why, and I said \"I don't like when your hand is under my shirt like that.\" Instead of pulling back and saying \"oh sorry\" he left it there and was like \"I think it feels nice\". He also puts my hand under his shirt the same way. I don't like that either.\n\nAnyway, lately I've been dreaming of paying off all my debt, saving a bunch of money, and moving to Toronto (big city in Canada; basically our version of NYC). I also want to get hot AF, dye my hair, get a tattoo, and get my belly button pierced.\n\nBut, I want to do it alone.\n\nI want to do it alone because I'm polyamorous so I would like to hold out for a relationship that better suits my needs once I move. I also would like to change the name I go by, and my boyfriend has already said that he would not call me by any name other than my first name, even if it was still a legal name (ie my middle name).\n\nPlease don't tell me that I can reinvent myself with him around, or that I don't need to move, or whatever. I'm aware that I don't *need* to be single and I don't *need* to move, but I also feel as though due to familial abuse and my boyfriend's lifestyle (very sedentary with lots of junk food, and 100% happy working a mediocre job with crappy hours, driving a shitty vehicle that only has insurance because of bandaid fixes that have now worn off, with toxic friends who don't have anything in common with him and who can't treat his girlfriend with respect), I wouldn't really accomplish the level of \"reinventment\", if you will, if I don't.\n\nAITA?",

When I was helping her with this we both kind of talked about our problems and got to know eachother better. (Remember this for later). \n\nWell they started dating and we didn’t really talk as often until around their 3 month “anniversary” of starting dating, when B started having some problems involving him not paying enough attention to her, kind of just not being the best boyfriend to her. Yet again I helped her out with that and we would FaceTime a lot and ended up getting closer than before, so now we both know a lot about eachother that other people don’t really know about (like funny stories that she’s never told and what not).\n\nAround this time, I developed a bit of a crush on B and this other girl, who we’ll call J. J also had a crush on me, so we started dating, and I stopped having a crush on B, for a few reasons (for one I was dating someone else and two I just wanted to be friends). \n\nSo yesterday B said that she has had a crush on me for a while and still does (she’s still dating K), and just said that she is really jealous of me and J, because B has had a lot of problems with K, and I’ve always been there for her. But she said that she knows J and I are happy together and that it would never work out if B tried to date me.\n\nWell I am a very empathetic person, and it always makes me feel bad to see someone else crying so I always try to help. She started crying about telling me and she felt really bad for having a crush on me, so out of empathy I said that I kind of have a thing for her too, but I don’t, because I’m dating J and I just don’t really like B in that way. I just felt super bad and knew it would make her happy, but it just feels weird, even though I don’t like her and haven’t liked for for like 2 months, even though I did like her before, and talk to her all the time still. \n\nTL:DR A girl who is taken told me, who is also taken, that she likes me, and started crying, so I told her I liked her too because I knew it would make her happier, even though I don’t like her, and we’re both taken. \n\nSo AITA here?",

I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nA few nights ago, I came home from the library and two of my roommates were sitting on the couch. I had earbuds in, but I took them off and she asked me to hand her a box of girl scout cookies sitting on the table. I gave her the box of cookies and she ate one cookie. She asked me if she could have another and my response was \"yeah sure, they're not mine though.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to all of us, those cookies were actually my roommate's Girl Scout cookies. In our roommate group chat, she then called me out for telling her the cookies were mine even though they weren't. I legitimately have no recollection of being asked if the cookies were mine or not until after she ate one (maybe the question was asked while I had earbuds in when I initially walked in the door and I went \"huh?\"), but they her and the other roommate that was there both got mad at me for saying the cookies were mine.\n\nI responded in the roommate group chat with \"literally fake news\" and huffed upstairs after they continued to accuse me of letting her steal my roommate's cookies. Am I the asshole for not stopping her from eating a cookie and for calling her \"fake news\" in the group chat? Or is she just overreacting and am I in the clear?",

It was filled to the brim with clothing that had just been messily thrown into the room and I cleaned all of it, including putting on all the washing.

I, by myself keep in mind, cleaned every other room in our massive house besides the lounge room. My Dad had the audacity to say I wasn't doing enough around the house and I needed to also clean the lounge room. I refused and said he was being emotionally manipulative (trying to pray on my sympathy saying things like \"I have a full time job to support us so the least you can do is clean this room\" type of thing as well as \"I'm so exhausted because I come home and I see this mess after a full days work\") and I didn't want to be in the house with him right now, so I went outside and tried to calm down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also like to point out I have homework I need to be doing and I get really bad asthma attacks when dust starts to rise.

All he talks about anymore is how he hates his job, and feels like it's eating away at his social life, mental health and everything. \n\n\nAt this point the CLEAR common denominator is just this job.

He agreed and when he arrived, I told him I didn't have cash and if quarters would be okay.

I put them on his desk in a neat stack and said if he wanted to keep them he could, but that I could just owe him one instead if he wanted.

So his reaction to this was not to give them back and tell me to just owe him, pay with Venmo, or hold onto it and just use it for vending machines or change, but to take them and throw it in the trash. I figured it wouldn't be a good idea to escalate his nonsense so I figured that meant the debt was settled and left it at that. Nothing else to add really, that's about it.",

            "input": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did happen a few years ago but to this day it still haunts me. I met a girl at work (lets call her T), and she was perfect. We went out a few times and everything was good. Unfortunately T had to move away for school, not super far but far enough that we couldn't hang out to much. \n\nNow T and her sister (we can call the sister K) both worked with me. I was not the biggest fan of K but she was the sister of T, and i was determined to be in good graces with her, as Those two were very close.  So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about. I considered both K and Q to be my friends but they were not necessarily friends with each other. So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!",

He has 2 kids from a previous relationship which in itself has been a huge adjustment. He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.\n\n I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like \"daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh\" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said \"hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?\" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going... Anyway , am I the asshole for wanting the Valentine's experience even though I know I'll always have to share him? ",

This filmmaker posts an ad for extras for his viking movie, and he posted it to our Facebook group. The compensation was snacks, and you had to bring your own garb and submit pics of you in it for consideration. He was also stupidly having men in Viking garb, and women in French high middle ages garb for \\*reasons\\*.\n\nI have worked in payroll for 10 years, and I'm very familiar with the FLSA (US law that regulates minimum wage, contractor/exempt/non-exempt employee status, and overtime pay). I even looked at the SAG requirements to make sure that movies were not an exception to FLSA (they aren't). I then spend the entire fucking day arguing that what he was doing was illegal. Somehow, I was \"killing his art\" and \"ruining his chances to make it in films\" and \"shitting on independent filmmaker who don't have the money of big studios\".\n\nI replied that he should fund raise to get the capital to keep up with his legal requirements. That the film company (because yes, it was a company that received pay for work) could get a loan from a bank. Or they could do a GoFundMe, or something other than wage theft. But of course, I'm the asshole for caring about the artists getting fair compensation for their art, but not about his art.  He was incredibly rude to me in front of my community.  When I reached out to his film company to inform them that what they were doing was illegal, I was rudely mocked and then blocked.\n\nSo, what he is doing is illegal.  The film company is being hypocritical, because they charge for doing film work like advertising and commercials, but they aren't compensating their extras.  I am a huge fan of the arts, and actively support my local arts scene.  But I'm also very much a fan of workers rights, and I happen to think that if your art relies on fucking over other artists than you don't deserve to \"make it\" in the business.

Dad left us and I’m an exact copy of him, I have the same hobbies, listen to same music and even look like him. I was reminded about this daily, and I remember a day when I was just standing around in kitchen and got told to \"stop looking like my father\". I knew I had to get out.

This dude got everything handed to him. Mom payed for his school while I had to get in debt, she decided he needs to start living alone so she gave him a house. And well, he doesn’t give a sh*t about all of that. He loves partying, drinks a lot and never even had a real job. He often throws tantrums when he can’t get more money and that’s when I come into this. Mom keeps calling me about these tantrums and issues with him, and I just feel like I don’t care.

I remember that I was lost when I moved out, and whenever I called she would never even let me start talking about stuff that was bothering me.

He’s now aware that I am not going and how busy I am in school.\n\nIt is now his birthday. Before I sent him a happy birthday text and an apology for not going, I find out that he stopped sharing his location with me, which seemed odd to me. I didn’t bring this up though. An hour after I texted him, I see him posting on instagram and I now know he’s ignoring me since he didn’t reply. Another 20 minutes or so goes by and I get a text from him. “K” was his response. \n\nAt this point I was mad because I apologized and I greeted him, while he forgot my birthday last year. I decided not to say anything. We haven’t contacted each other since then and I don’t plan on being the first one to say something. AITA?\n\nTL;DR - Back in January, I agreed to go skydiving with my best friend on his birthday, which was a few days ago. However, I didn’t go because I was busy with exams.

Last Friday I had a really rough day in spite of my efforts not to let the negativity get to me and ended up crying in my car at the end of my shift. I then posted a thing on Facebook detailing all of my issues which I deleted shortly after. A girl I work with took it to my bosses and I am waiting to be told about it. \n\nI have to be quick because I have to get ready for work. \n\nBasically I work in a place where the long time staffers bully the new people. I don't know any other way to put it. New people are oftentimes ignored if they need help. We are barked at for not doing things while we're in the middle of doing those things. More than once I have cried on my way home from work because of how cruel these other girls could be.\n\nI thought maybe it was me so I changed my attitude from dreading going there and taking everything really hard to a positive attitude. That worked for a few days. Then, the Friday before last, I got yelled at for literally everything. \"You need to go to the dining room!\" When I was going there. They didn't need to say that. \n\nI made a very dumb mistake and I owned it but one of my co-workers threw paperwork at me and yelled at me that she wasn't doing her job because I screwed up my job and that i would have to do both. A nurse was nearby, heard this 40 something woman yelling at me, and did nothing. \n\nAfter a long day of one thing after another I got told that I \"never listen\" because I wasn't paying attention to a woman who I didn't realize was talking to me while I tried to do some paperwork on a resident. She was trying to give me more work to do when I was supposed to be going home shortly. I told her that it sounded like another shift should do that, as I was going home very soon, and she said \"well then it'll never get done!\" Which I guess is a compliment but by then my feelings were in the gutter and I burst into tears. \n\nI clocked out early against the rules and went and cried in my car because I had really tried that day not to let the bullying get to me but it didn't matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stop and eventually I broke. \n\nSo when i got home I posted this thing talking about my experience there. All of the new people who started with me also have similar experiences.  I deleted the post very quickly but a girl still took it to one of my bosses and I only found out about it last night. It really explains why different people in different departments really ramped up the bullying in the past week. The post must have been passed around. \n\nAITA for posting that on Facebook after my bad day ?",

            "input": "Hey guys, I know this title already seems crazy but let me explain in detail.\n\nI’m a 17 year old girl who lives with my grandma and father (although he never comes home and doesn’t spend any time with me) in Toronto and I have lots of mental health issues. These issues have been diagnosed by many psychiatrists and I’ve even been hospitalized for months on end because of them.  This may seem irrelevant to the story I’m about to tell you but bare with me it comes into play. BIG TIME. \n\nSo my father, we will call him Joe, he has a girlfriend whom we will call Mary. Joe and Mary have been together for around 8 months now and Mary even has a daughter who is fairly close to my age (her age being 20) and we share the same interests and mental health problems. We both have anxiety and clinical depression, her having anxiety more intense than mine and I also suffer from something called borderline personality disorder. (This causes you to have extreme mood swings and fear of abandonment issues) We shall call the daughter Mei. \n\nSo here’s where the actual story takes place. A few days ago on Saturday, Joe and I went to his girlfriends house to spend time. Me and Mei were telling Mary about how once we ordered Uber eats and both had anxiety attacks that the delivery guy was going to kill us and I had pulled a knife and hid behind the door. Joe chimes in even though he’s not included in the conversation and starts downplaying our mental illnesses. He starts saying things like \n\n“Oh, how can you guys have anxiety! Just done give a fuck about what’s going on!” \n \n“Oh come on really? BPD isn’t even that bad hahah you could’ve had cancer or something just shattttupppp” \n\nGee, thanks, my anxiety is now cured. Anyways he kept saying stuff like that and it was clearly angering everyone in the room. Me especially because he kept mentioning my disorder (BPD) even though he knows it causes me to cut myself and that’s what got me hospitalized. \nSo I accidentally slipped up and said\n\n “shut the fuck up” \n\nAt that point I knew I done goofed and instantly lowered my head. I apologized profusely and said I didn’t mean to say that and that I was out of line and he laughed it off and went upstairs. The next day when we were leaving he started screaming at me in the car. He told me he should’ve slapped me in my face and embarrassed me. I was super tired and the words went right through one ear and out the other.  \n\nFast forward to Monday. Me and my father joe didn’t speak all Monday with exception of him sending me texts saying what he told me in the car but now with a twist. \n\n“It’s February 11th and you have until the end of the week to get another job or else I’m selling everything you own, because I bought it. Welcome to reality.” \n\nThis caused me to have an anxiety attack at school and I went home early. I did apply to some places and thank goodness got a call back and I have an interview on Thursday. Anyways, on Tuesday I had to stay home because schools were cancelled due to an snow storm and he didn’t go to work for the same reason. He took this as his chance to burst into my room and scream at me. He called me every name in the book, he threatened to yank my piercings out my face, he even took it upon himself to yank the hood of my sweater basically choking me just so I would look at him. Mind you by that time he had already screamed at me to clean my room so I was folding clothes, that’s why I wasn’t looking at him.  I started screaming because I thought he was going to hit me in my face like he said he would and I had a major breakdown. Now my grandma says that if I try to leave and stay anywhere else he and the rest of my family will cut me off. \n\nAITA for telling him to shut the fuck up? \n\nEdit: guys how I put screenshots ?? I have text conversation with my aunt and mom, I don’t know if that’ll add any proof but I don’t know how to use reddit .. \n\nEdit 2: hey guys I had deleted the app shortly after posting this, I honestly just needed to vent. But all that aside, me and my father made up, we talked about it. I’m fine for those who are asking, no need to worry! ",

            "input": "Ok, so I'm coming here before acting on this, but here is the situation: I live in San Diego with my wife and son at her parents house currently. We live with roommates as it's a 6 bedroom house. We rent the rooms with all utilities included, access to the pool, laundry room, and both patio areas are open for them to have late night guests. We offer them cheaper for students, as that's who we mainly attract being close to the university. In doing so we share common areas. The kitchen being one of them. I cook, A LOT, and whenever I cook, I always tell the other three people living here that there is plenty of food for them to share, and most nights they will come and join us for dinner, or at least eat leftovers. This is done out of generosity because I see how hard a lot of them work, and two of who are here from out of state and away from family. This is where the problem started, and I thought should have ended. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, I took my wife and son out to a Japanese restaurant. My wife loves sushi, and that is our treat usually once a month. My son loves teriyaki so it's a win for everyone. After eating, my wife ordered two sushi roll to take home and eat with the movie we picked for that night. So we grab the to go sushi and head home. A few hours after arriving home, we start popping corn for the movie and my wife noticed her sushi is gone. We asked around, and sure enough the only make tenant we have ate them. Actually went into the bag, opened it up, and ate her two sushi rolls. About 16 pieces. I was flabbergasted. I asked him very angrily why he would do that, and he says, \"You always offer us lunch or dinner, so I thought leftovers would be the same way.\"\n\nThat to me screams entitlement, and I am not excited that my wife's food was just taken within just a few hours of even being purchased. He obviously saw that it was not leftovers either, but an entirely separate purchase. \n\nI discussed with him that it was not acceptable to go into our possessions, whether it be food or otherwise, and to use common sense before eating anything that is not his, as I have NEVER ordered takeout or from a restaurant for these tenants before.\n\nThis brought up a discussion with the other tenants, and we discovered that one had actually purchased a mini fridge because her food would turn up missing also. When confronted with this information, the food thief admitted to drinking her iced coffees, her cheesecake, etc. Overall, not fucking cool. We told him he had 30 days from the first of this month to be out, because he violated the tenant agreement by stealing others belongings. We have to look out for those renting our rooms, so the eviction was a mutual agreement. \n\nHe argues of course, but ultimately knows he can do nothing. Yet, he now knows he has nothing to worry about with stealing food. So yes, food has been disappearing ALL week from everyone.\n\nHere is where I need an opinion. I want to buy a nice steak and leave it in my car for a couple days, then prepare it with some veggies and potatoes and leave it on the refrigerator, obviously for the food thief to eat and get sick. Is this illegal? Is there any other suggestions for me to get my petty ass revenge on a food thief in my home?",

My roommate (F, 23) and I (M, 24) were acquaintances in college and decided to room together as she had also gotten a job in the same city. Soon after arriving, I started dating my girlfriend, who I met through my roommate (friend of a friend).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, our shared bathroom has gotten so filthy I try my best to avoid showering at home – I shower literally anywhere else: my girlfriend’s place, the gym, my friends’ places. After my roommate showers, there’s just a thick layer of slippery soap scum and long hair. I slipped and slided around in the tub for months before giving in and buying a shower scrubber. I’ve bought every cleaning product in an attempt to reduce the slipping risk in the bathtub. If I have to shower at home, I spend a good 5 mintues before each shower trying to get rid of the soap scum so I don't have to step in it. \n\nI’ve mentioned it to her a few times, pretty passively (“Hey, I’ve had some good success with X product for the tub, give it a shot!”) trying not to actively blame her for the scum, but there’s really only scum after she showers – it might be the coconut oil or something. I've gotten neutral/negative response, no change in behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for suggesting we hire a professional cleaner? My girlfriend thinks that would be really passive aggressive, but there are some other areas that could use some cleaning (kitchen, living room) and I wouldn’t mind footing half the bill in order to have a clean home to return to. Part of me hopes she'll get the message and start cleaning up after herself instead. I’d like to reiterate that I don’t expect her to clean because she’s a girl – I clean up after myself in communal areas and just expect her to do the same (even though she makes more of a mess).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t want to piss her off/directly confront her since she’s in the same social circles as my girlfriend, and they seem kind of gossipy/cliquey and I don't want to do that to my girlfriend.

I spotted an open isle with a car backing out just as the car in front of it was also leaving. The cars park in strips of two so these cars had been parked nose to nose. So technically now this opened up two spots that were directly connected and I could have pulled through my intended spot and gone right into the spot in front of it so another car which had come up behind me could take my original spot. The problem with this however, is that I planned to make some large purchases, buying an appliance and small piece of furniture. If I had pulled through, this guy would have snugged right up behind me and when I came back out I wouldn’t be able to open my back hatch/gate and load my items. So I stopped in my intended spot and parked. This guy was furious, laid on his horn and rolled his window down to berate me. I simply replied that I needed to be able to load large items in my car and this was going to be a big shop. I couldn’t have my back end blocked. He was so mad. His wife flipped me the bird and they sped off like crazy people in a parking lot with pedestrians everywhere. \n\nI guess I could have pulled right through and out into the next aisle, done like a 5 point turn and reparked in my required direction, but the lot was so crowded and I probably would have just confused another car in the next aisle while doing an Austin powers technique getting my car turned around.

Her granddaughter has lived with her most if her life since my cousin died and the girl's mom is a deadbeat. My little cousin is a brat with a capital B, and as messy as her grandmother.

My Mom can't really clean up after herself but at least she tries, my Aunt and cousin have no excuse they are just gross. I will clean the place just about spotless but still there will always be something she finds fault with. The pillows on the couch aren't arranged properly, I load the dishwasher incorrectly, anything of mine or my mother's being visible is not acceptable.

I used to clean the place like it was my job but I just care less and less. It's starting to look bad and I'm hurting no one but myself and my mom. I can just hardly stand to be out of my room most of the time anymore. The complaints hurt as I'm doing my best and I am starting to feel more like a maid than a member of the family.

I’m now a college freshman.\n\nThis all happened in my freshman year in concert band. There happened to be a kid with autism in my class. The first day when I met him, we chatted about random stuff like football and other sport-related things. I can definitely tell without anyone telling me that he has autism, as I worked as a ilc tutor for most of middle school. I am totally fine talking and hanging out with pretty much anyone as I don’t care what a person looks like as long as their actions aren’t bad. Things are going smoothly, until 1 day about a quarter way through the semester he asks me a very inappropriate question relating to my genitals. I tell him “that’s not an ok thing to say” and everything is fine. Or so I thought. Throughout the next month the frequency of these sorts of comments increase, as do my response intensities. It got to the point where I felt sexually harassed, and I started telling him to “shut the fuck up and leave me alone, asshole.” He went away after that.\n\nNow it’s at this point in the story where some of you are gonna say “just tell a teacher,” and yes, I agree, that would be a great thing to do except since he has autism, unless he physically does something to me, the teachers won’t do jack shit.\n\nAfter I said that to him, the next day, he started saying that he was going to get me expelled from my school because I was a discgrase (bad spelling sorry). I had enough at this point so I started messing with him a little bit. I went along with his game, and every time he would say something about me being a bad kid, I would go along with it and make up stories about being a criminal. (My favorite was telling him I was a time traveling bank robber.) other than this, I didn’t say anything insulting to him. \n\nOne night, after a concert, his twin brother who doesn’t have any mental handicaps told me to stop messing with his brother or he would beat me up. I stopped after that and just avoided the kid entirely. \n\nI know it’s been like 4 years, but this still sticks in my mind. I really don’t know if I was the asshole in this situation so I’d like Reddit’s opinion.\n\nThanks for reading. Let me know if I should put a TL:DR",

Anyway, the OP was complaining about how the girls in the series don't seem to be as muscular as the boys, and I chimed in by saying that its harder for women to become visibly muscular like men, but that a lack of muscle doesn't mean that a woman isn't physically fit. Another person chimed in and said that I was sexists and that this line of thinking was a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I initially wrote off the other person as being overly sensitive, but I later realized that I could've been mistaken because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this field. I found some articles that supported my statement, but I wasn't sure if they were reliable or not. Even if my statement about women and muscle gain was correct, is it still sexists to say something like that?",

Sorry if this cuts too deep for some;  a NSFW tag is recommended or requested, I’ll add one, no questions asked.\n\n(Excessive backstory - skip to end if you want to save yourself a few minutes)\nAt the beginning of last spring break, my grandmother on my fathers side passed away due to medical complications resulting from old age and a history of rather heavy tobacco usage from her early teen years to shortly before her first pregnancy in her early thirties, let’s say twenty years. No condolences needed; it is a fact of life and I’ve since moved on completely.\n\nThis warrior of a lady’s death was expected but MASSIVELY sudden in a way. She had, over the course of nearly half a decade, brushed death, dodged death, experienced it for several seconds, and everything in between. If death were a person, she gave them a taste of their own medicine before giving up. This absolute unit of a human was pronounced legally dead a dozen times before she succumbed to a peaceful, endless sleep in her warm living room surrounded by her dog, my mother and father, and me.\n\nI’ll spare you the novel that I could easily write right now, but when she finally left us for good, I was overcome with... nothing.\n\nMy father and mother both were silent for a few painful moments before shedding any tears. I had seen my mom cry plenty of times, but my dad went from the most humble and masculine stereotype to a sobbing mess. However, it wasn’t just sadness. It was anger.\n\nI decided to excuse myself, as it was very late and I had school in a matter of hours. Before I could finish my sentence, my dad turned me to and said, completely un ironically, “Why did you even come down here in the fucking first place, Waynard_Ferguson?” \n\nThis was a bit jarring to me. My father didn’t particularly like his mother, and she wasn’t exactly what you would call a sweet old lady, so his attack towards me specifically was not expected.\n\nI explained to him in a stammering sentence that I wanted to be there for support and since I had been the only person there besides my mom (brothers moved out), that I would at least stay and offer my very real sympathy. This didn’t sit well with him, either.\n\n“You could’ve just told me the truth, and stay locked in your room like always. Had you not come down, I wouldn’t even know you were home!” this was delivered in not much less than a choked up, grieving whisper, but was deafening nonetheless. I looked to my mother, who didn’t speak, which was the right move in retrospect.\n\nAfter this, I didn’t really know what to say, or if I should even say anything. at all. He broke an uncomfortable eye contact with me after a few seconds, and told me in a hushed tone to go to bed, along with an assumption that I only wanted to leave because of my selfishness.\n\nLong story short, my father wasn’t mad at my predetermined lack of care for the situation, as he explained after his irrational state of grief passed. He was upset by my outwardly emotionless reaction to not just his mother’s death, but really anything related to the situation. It’s not that I didn’t care about my father and what he was going through. It’s just that I didn’t have the strong emotional connection that my father had, or anything close to it, to display that I was in fact emotionally moved by a VERY raw display of reality in front of me. I will admit, I didn’t cry or have a very strong reaction, if at all, to her death. I’m not sure why, I just couldn’t find it in me to be upset.\n\nTo be fair, she was quite the grandmother. She would insist on taking me to and from school regardless if my mom was or wasn’t going to, she would take me shopping for anything I needed with a seemingly endless supply of money, and wouldn’t show the slightest bit of irritation whenever I broke something of hers or said something stupid out of child ignorance. Not to mention, she would fix me meals fit for an entire family. She did this for not only me, but my two older brothers, and only stopped when she couldn’t breath on her own anymore.\n\nMy father, at the time, seemed to only think that I was leaving the room because I was uncomfortable being around him, and not really thinking about the fact that I just watched someone die for the first time.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not being upset from her death, and more specifically not feeling obligated to address her condition in a way that wasn’t dismissive? And this isn’t really asking if my dad was the offender, because he wasn’t. Is there something going on with me that would justify my lack of guilt or sorrow? Or am I just an unfeeling person? I left the room because I was uncomfortable, sure. But I was 17, exhausted, and just witnessed something not many people can easily forget about. ",

I made sure I had drinks covered, music she liked and all the decor set up.\n\nWhen she got here she was shocked, we had a blast at first. Eating food, drinking, it all went wrong on the dance floor. My moms friends were pretty drunk and began doing some scandalous dances, such as twerking and grinding on friends in a joking manner. \n\nThat’s when it got more serious and my mom joined in and began twerking furiously, being the supportive daughter I am (and very drunk) said “Yeah, fuck it up bitch!” Like in a friend way, not like being derogatory.\n\nShe immediately froze, and began tearing up, I was so confused. She ran out of the venue and I went after her, she explained that she felt massively disrespected and ashamed on her birthday.

            "input": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy relationship with my parents has always been strained. This is for a number of reasons. To start off in the 4th grade they left a cult, a cult I still believed in, I didn't really have anyone to talk to at the time, so I resorted to the internet to help me work through what I believed. At this point I didn't really see my parent's as a role model. They also had me during college, a decision I am certain they now both regret, so I feel partially responsible for them being stuck with a kid they don't want. In the 6th grade I was being an ass, making fun of my dads friend, thinking that neither him or I was taking it seriously, unfortunately  I didn't know I was being an dick until I heard my dad call me an ass after I left the room. This type of scenario happened again with my mom. She was complaining about me and my siblings not helping out as much as we should. I got mad and said that it was her job to clean  up after us, I know I was the asshole in the scenario, unfortunately I didn't know how much of a dick I was being until my dad came home. I heard her crying to my dad in their room, and I started feeling really bad about it. A few minutes later my dad came into my room and asked me \"why are you being such an ass to your mom\".  It is because of these events, and many little ones, that I am very reserved around my parents, I think they are going to talk about me behind my back. I also feel like I can't rely on my parents emotionally, so I have been resorting to the internet and myself for advice/emotional support since the 6th grade. This has matured me, greatly, and I would argue that I am capable of making thought out and mature decisions, as I couldn't rely on them to make these decisions for me. (as in setting rules, giving advice on what I should do, ect.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so jumping too present day. On Christmas we go to a friends house, a couple hours into the event my mom and her friend go outside to, I later figure out, smoke a cigarette.  Now I am fine with that, I have no right to judge what she does, and as long as its not a repeating thing I don't really think its a health issue. However, I am not allowed outside during this time, as she probably doesn't want to set a bad example for me. (keep in mind I don't consider them role models anymore). Later on New Years they say that we are going to the Rose parade, as they found a way to get in easily. However, we would have to go early. and I thought that after staying up late New Years eve I wouldn't have enough energy to enjoy the parade. Long story short, they forced my to go, and I ended up napping the entire time. After winter break I started independent study, and they are now worried that I will stop seeing friends, and  instead stay inside all day. Independent study has allowed me to complete other work that I would normally do all weekend, feeling guilty if I didn't dedicate every moment of my free time to this work (I am a bit of a workaholic). This weekend, now that I didn't fill an extreme amount of guilt for hanging out, I decided to take a long break, watching Netflix and playing video games with friends all weekend. Meanwhile I put off chores until Monday, last night my parents shut off my internet, telling me they wouldn't turn it on until I got my chores done. I did my chores, and, rudely, told them to turn the internet back on. They told me that I was being disrespectful and entitled, I told them to stop parenting me, and that if I could get a job and leave I would. (Though I do have experience to get a job in programming, I am also 14... so I cant get a job).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for getting mad when my parents try to... parent me? ",

I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada.

I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide.

She went on an absolute rant yesterday about how M is ruining her plans just to spread her legs. That she just wants to get laid. She said a lot of this kind of slut shaming stuff. I was in shock so I didn’t say anything other than I think she is being unfair. \n\nThen we were on lunch, we were sitting with L and L was explaining how she has a stomach infection and I felt really bad for her. When L left, N started saying that she has no sympathy since in the past L had a major sexual history and left guys stuck it in her butt and that’s probably why she is sick. \nAgain I was in shock and didn’t know what to do. \n\nOvernight I had a big think about it. Realised how much it bothered me and so this morning when we had our morning phone call I confronted her about it. I said it was inappropriate and I didn’t like that she was so willing to dish out abusive comments and if she was going to continue to not do it around me. \n\nShe fought me on it. I said that it wasn’t the kind of thing I want said about me so I would appreciate her keeping the comments to herself. \n\nToday she came up to me and asked if we could get lunch together and I initially said yes and then regretted it. So when lunch came and she was already talking to another co-worker I left and ate elsewhere. \n\nShe is now complaining to anyone who will listen about it all, including our manager. \n\nAm I being the asshole for standing up for my own beliefs?

I just really need a neutral perspective on this. \n\n  I have ADHD, which makes it pretty difficult to sit and focus in class without doing something with my hands. In highschool I'd find myself constantly doodling to help me listen to teachers. Through both highschool and college I've never really had any problems with it, until today. \n  \nCurrently I'm taking a communications class that's required of my major. Everyone gives a speech in class every two weeks or so. This class goes for 3 hours, so going in I knew I'd be fidgety. I got my speech out of the way and started drawing in my sketchbook. \n  \n It must have taken her sometime to notice me, because in the middle of class after a student gave their speech she called across the room for me to close my book and pay attention. She then announced to the whole class about how doing anything besides listening quietly was unacceptable and horribly disrespectful. Everyone went on break for a few minutes and I had time to put away my things.\n \n This is the part that probably puts me in asshole territory. If I was smart I would have not done anything and just sat quietly. But this is the 3rd time this professor has passive aggressively lectured me in front of the whole class, so I was feeling pretty grumpy. I didn't want to risk disassosiating and getting anxiety because of this teacher. So I took out my smaller sketchbook and turned more towards the speakers to show that I was paying attention. She was not happy about this.\n\n  After class was finished she told me to stay when everyone left. She then berated me about how horribly disrespectful and distracting I was to everyone. Because of this I'd be losing 10 percent of my grade on my own speech- and she was going to bring it up to the chairman because me drawing was that problematic to the rest of the class. She went on to aggressively tell me how horrible I was for a good few minutes. Even after explaining why I was doodling she said she didn't care. because I didn't have an accommodation letter, she couldn't(wouldn't) accept the excuse; and that other kids in class have problems and don't bother anyone in class. \n  \n I think she handled the whole situation rather horribly, but she has a point- I should of gotten some resources from my school's student disability services awhile ago. No matter what I end up doing I'm definitely going to talk to them about accommodations in the future so situations like this don't happen again. \n\nI grew up being a good student, so I'm honestly not used to handling teachers that don't like me.

This final happened to be for my theatre class. We were to perform 3 showings of a play over 3 days. I was a major character and had NO understudy so if I didn’t show up the show could not go on and I wouldn’t be able to graduate with the rest of my class. \n\nAt the beginning of the semester our teacher gave us the 3 days the play was  going to be on so that we could make sure that we had ample time to plan our schedules around it (May 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) My mom tells me she’s thinking about having her wedding (her 3rd marriage) during either the first or second week of May and I told her that if it was on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd that I wouldn’t be able to be there for it because of the play.\n\nFast forward and it’s May and we’ve already done our first 2 performances. A month earlier my mom told me that she and her husband were having the wedding on the 3rd at 2pm. I said alright and left at that thinking that she remembered that my final was that day. I should have followed up with her to make sure she remembered and that was my mistake.\n\nSo it’s the 3rd and we’re all at the theatre rehearsing our lines and putting on make-up etc. But then I get the phone call.My mom wants to know when I am going to be there for the wedding to help set up. I tell my mom that I’m not going to the wedding and that I had told her I couldn’t go because of the show like I had told her months ago. \n\nShe flipped her shit and immediately began screaming at me. Telling her I never told her that I couldn’t come (bullshit) and that she never heard that I would be busy ( she went to this play and had a play bill IN HER HAND with the dates and times of the showings) and that this is important to her so I should just come anyway.\n\nWhen I told her no I could not just come because of my role and the fact that my entire graduation depended on me doing this performance (like I had told her) she called me a liar and asked how stupid I thought she was that a play would be my final. She then threw at me that “Well this is my third wedding so I bet you don’t think it’s important anyway you’ll just make it to the next one,” and I got angry and said “yeah that’s exactly it.” \n\nI know it was petty and childish but she had pissed me off. She didn’t talk to me for a while after that and to this day refuses to believe that I A) told her about the play B) it was my final C) I wouldn’t have graduated if I bailed. So am I an Asshole?",

We live close to her family, and it uses half of my vacation allocation yearly which severely limits the time I get to see my own family.

It didn't work, because thankfully they were all reasonable and told her what she was doing was wrong, but it was a HUGE embarrassment to me. She apologized profusely but this is a reoccurring issue with her that she knows I get sick missing my family, she knows how I feel isolated, and then she tries to involve them and have them gang up on me.

I was fine. my car was totaled. and insurance takes a while. \n\nI was spending $50 a day just to get to work and back. because public transit didn't reach my new workplace. \n\neventually the stress of it got to me.

He told me he told his best friends about my mental health issues and some of my insecurities. On several occasions he also told me what they advised him to do. I understand his need for an outlet but it hurts so much to know my privacy isn't protected and I'm constantly wondering what they're thinking when they see me.\n\n2. He tells me what he honestly thinks about me, like, he can't respect certain things about me because I make poor life choices because of my mental health issues. Let's just say he has no filter. Sometimes the things he says absolutely shatters me. It has come to the extent of me not telling him things sometimes for fear of his response.\n\nI'm not blaming him for saying these things because I get where he's coming from and he's just being honest but I feel like his need to keep his slate clean is at the expense of my mental and emotional well-being. The cumulation of everything he has said is exacerbating my depression and anxiety and sometimes I can't even function because I get so preoccupied with every little word.\n\nI told him I need what I define as a gentleman. Someone who will understand what to say and what not to say to me by prioritising my feelings. E.g. telling me what he tells his best friends is unnecessary. I would honestly be completely fine assuming he doesn't tell them my deep dark secrets. But now I can't unknow it. Every time I know he meets them without me, it ruins my entire day because I obsess over what they're saying about me. I have gone through a lot that I don't want the world to know - 3 suicide attempts, self-harming to the extent of endangering my life. P.S. - I'm not even forbidding him from telling them. I just feel like there's a combination of him prioritising himself and his friendships over me. But he says I carry too much shame over my mental health issues and it's a vicious cycle.\n\nHe says he needs to be able to tell me everything because that is what strengthens emotional connection for him and also he's lived a very fulfilling life adhering to this philosophy. No lies, no secrets, no omissions. A complete open book.\n\nBut it's also killing me. AITA for not wanting him to practice this philosophy with me? Or is it a deeper compatibility issue that cannot be solved?\n\nFor context if it matters, I'm 31F, he's 40M and we've been together over a year.",

Those are automatically YTA material. \n\nNow she has always loved animals, which I get and I love them to, but not to the extent which she does. Animals are a lot of work and a lot of money to take care of between the food, the litter, (for cats which is what we have) replacing the litter boxes every so often, etc... Well when we first got together she had 2 cats. Fine and dandy, 2 is manageable and I like cats so no big deal. Well after picking up a few strays along the way, and not having the money to get them fixed when we should have (don't start about that, I get it, bad cat owners. Remember what I said about them being expensive?) we eventually topped off at 6 permanent cats with litters of kittens that we got rid of along the way. It hasn't been easy and its caused a lot of stress between us and to us personally but we made it through. Last year we lost two of our cats due to health complications (we got them to the vet, they were sick with feline leukemia and we had to have them euthanized for different reasons between the two of them). It was very hard on both of us but we were back down to a manageable, albeit not ideal, 4 cats. Well guess what? The only female kitten we have got pregnant again and had a litter of 5 kitten, we still have all 5 6 months later with no end in sight. Oh, and guess what? She's pregnant again and about to burst. Our last male cat has an appointment to be fixed this month and I told her outright that if he doesnt get fixed, and the kittens that are 6 months old aren't gone by the end of the month, I'm leaving. \n\nNow let me explain why, besides the ridiculous amount of stress it puts on me since I'm currently staying home and have to clean up after 9 cats, and stay up all night to make sure the kittens don't end up pregnant. When our pregnant cat has kittens again, I can see her current kittens causing issues for the new litter. The current litter likes to try to be around mom, obviously, but the mom doesnt like it, I guess because she's pregnant again. So I can see that being a problem when mom is with her new litter. I also am fearful for the health of not only our cats, but the 6-month old litter. Feline leukemia is contagious and we aren't yet sure which of our cats, if any more, have it. The longer this litter is around our cats, the more susceptible they are to the disease. Also the 6-month old litter is causing a lot of stress to our current cats, cause we simply dont have room for 9 cats plus ANOTHER litter right now. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope. She won't meet me halfway when it comes to getting rid of them. The animal shelter is very expensive to surrender them to ($100 per kitten) amd she doesnt want to post them online because she wants to make sure they go to a good home, which I understand but look what that's costing us. I left home almost a week ago to get a break from all the cats and if it were up to me I wouldnt go back, but I wanted to make it clear to her that I absolutely would be leaving again for good if the kittens weren't gone by the end of the month and our last male cat wasn't fixed.

She was his first real girlfriend and they dated for about two months or so.

            "input": "This is a long story and it's a bit hard for me to describe the situation since there are lots if details  and I'm not going to omit info since details matter \nTL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo a little background. My work consists of me helping my dad on our own construction site. It's a pretty large construction site for the fact that there are few workers. Usually it's my Dad and an unskilled labourer. When I have a holiday I go to help him because I understand that he is working for me and my brother's future. Usually I go from 7 am-11 am (4 hours since I'm underage). In these Christmas holidays I've been going everyday except Sunday and Christmas. I didn't go for the last 2 days since I had to go do voluntary work for a school project. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I told my Dad that I didn't need to voluntary work tomorrow (which is today) so I can come to work he said he'll find me something to do. My dad pays me since he thinks that motivates me to come to work and I'm grateful. This morning I woke at 6:30 had breakfast and changed  my clothes to the concrete caked ones and rode my bike to the construction site it takes me about 5 minutes to get there at normal speed on my bike. On arrival I left my bike near the door and closed it and went inside the kitchen put on safety shoes and drank a glass of water.\n\n I went up stairs to the part if the building still being built and I found my dad and the unskilled labourer (Who was pretty new about 3 weeks) building the roof of a room. I asked my dad what I should do and he told me to take the scattered stones around the room near the buzzsaw. After, I helped the labourer take up a stone on his shoulder (about 30 by 8 inches of limestone) and he climbed onto the ladder to pass it to my dad. My dad told him not to lift it like that (from his back) and when I helped him lift it onto his shoulder again, my dad told me (in our language, the labourer was foreign) \"Has this guy never seen anyone lift a stone?\" I wasn't sure how to respond since I forgot the proper way to lift it too. Then he showed him how. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later he got a call from the guy we borrowed the material lift from that they were outside and came to get it. My dad said to me \"Already? We just have to lift these last few things and we will give it to them, go open the door for them.\" So I went downstairs and opened the door for them I couldn't see them clearly due to my -7 eyesight and me not wanting to break my glasses at work so I waved to them but when they didn't respond I taught they were the neighbours and got slightly embarrassed/awkward.  \"Come in\" I said but they must have heard \"Coming\" instead and said don't worry. I was confused so I went back upstairs and saw my dad and the labourer carrying the lift and then tying it up so we would lift it with the crane (Which was in the courtyard) onto the ramp were the truck with stones usually comes for deliveries. \"Go open the gate\" my dad said. The gate was locked from the outside so I had to go open. I opened the gate for the truck to go onto the ramp. \n\nMy dad then asked me from the 1st floor where the lift and room with roof they were working on where \"Did the truck come in?\" Why did he ask me this? Sound travels badly here so If I could hear him asking me this question he should be able to see the truck. I respond with a loud \"yes\" so that he can hear me. I went back upstairs and drove the tower crane with the lift onto their truck and proceeded to go back downstairs and close the gate. When I went back upstairs my dad asked me why I was shouting I told him so that he could hear me. He told me the I embarrassed him in front of the truck drivers by yelling and getting angry. What? He didn't even talk to them! I've been told I always sound angry which is probably true but what was I supposed to do! He asked me a question! \n\nWell whatever I brushed it off and went back to work. I started sweeping the floor off debris and stone dust into a wheelbarrow. While doing that I talked to my dad about something that popped into my head, \"I thought Noel (my brother) was coming with you guys tonight to the dinner of your friends? Is he coming with me to sleep at our grandparents? Did he change his mind?\" He then said \"Let him do whatever he wants.\" My dad then went to cut some stones in the other room with the buzzsaw. \n\nI continued sweeping the floor. Labourer comes in the room with a stone carrier and a stone on it and lays the stone on the floor.  He then stares at the ladder breathing heavily. Then after staring for about a minute at the ladder proceeds to move it to the side and also move the concrete bricks underneath to make the ladder higher. He then goes back out of the room. He then comes in with a new stone on the carrier and dies the same thing again. What? Why does he keep doing that? He didn't even use the ladder before. And instead of going round the pile of stone dust he proceeds to trample over it with the carrier and his himself. He did this last week too. This fucker. He can spend a minute staring at a fucking ladder but he can't waste a second to go round the pile I was sweeping. Ok I wasn't that angry since it happened before but I was annoyed. Whatever. He then comes back into the room with a new stone and proceeds to do the same thing minus the trample thing.\n\nWhat even is going on? I go to the other room. \"Dad, what was is it you told him to do? He keeps moving the ladder around.\"\n\"I told him to move the ladder so he can put stones instead of the ladder\"\n\"Why is he moving it each time he comes into the room?\"\n\"Every time you do this! Mind your own business, I'm in charge of him! This isn't school! Going to report people to the teacher.\"\nWhat the hell! Last time I did this was 5 months ago when a different labourer kept staring about and doing nothing when he could be doing something! \n\nI got the wheelbarrow I was filling with stone dust and debris took it to its room. I put my broom and shovel in the storage room and went downstairs. I checked my phone it should be 9 at least by now right? 8:20 and a missed call. It was mom, I called her back\n\"Honey, ask dad if he opened the garage so that the maid can come in and call me back with his answer\"\n\nSo I went and asked him.\n\"He said yes mom, also in coming home early\"\n\"Isn't there anything to do?\"\n\"Not really, bye\"\n\nMy dad always told me if you don't want to be here you can leave I'm not forcing you. I never did leave early since when I started in June since I felt guilty, even in days where it was 35°C and I was stuck driving the crane. \n\"Dad,I'm leaving\"\n\"Bored already?\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn my mind I rationalized there was no crucial work to be done and I would end up wasting time.\nI already felt terrible for leaving work early because i felt entitled and thought it would be awkward later today when he comes home.\n\nWhen I arrived home I heard Mom in her new office talking in the phone. Then I realised it was dad.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"DAHunter go get your laptop down here you're not allow to use it\"\n\"What? Why!\"\n\"Dad has been telling me how you yelled at him in front if the construction workers, reporting your brother and reporting the labourer!\"\nI couldn't help it, I yelled at her\n\"WHAT THE HELL HE IS MAKING STUFF UP I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT\"\nShe then got off the phone, my mom has a problem with stress and I felt bad for shouting.\nI then proceeded to explain my side if the story.\n\"DAHunter, you're racist! You always go report anything the labourers do wrong just because they are black!\" \nWhat has that got to do with anything?\n\"I don't hate black people mom! I hate idiots!\"\n\"That doesn't excuse you embarrassing your father!\"\nShe then shouted from across the house \n\"Noel! Get off your computer and come do your homework!\" (Noel is 12 and that's not his real name). \n\nI then went to take a shower for about 20 minutes. I still can't see what I did wrong. Maybe from their point if view I did something wrong because I'm easily angered. My shout sounds angry, My dad thinks I always pick on my brother even when he is not there and apparently I'm a racist and can't stand people. Sorry this was so long but I wanted as much if the story here since I'm not sure during which moment I was an asshole in.\n\nTL:DR My dad got mad at me at work for yelling and apparently embarrassing him and asking him what the hell the labourer was doing. I went home and he called my mom with a version that was to me, twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The family is from the middle east, it's not unusual at big family gatherings for my FIL to call out my husband, in front of his extended family, for being cheap. Which I know bothers my husband, though it doesn't push him to change our spending habits. His father can be a generous person, it is not unusual for him to decide in the moment to drop $100  for everyone's dinner. \n\nSix months into the marriage, my SIL had her birthday and her dad surprised her with a brand new I-Phone. During the party my husband looked troubled, I kept asking what was up and he would just shake his head, \"Not now.\" On the drive home he took out his phone and checked our phone bill. My FIL had purchased the phone through our account, adding a payment plan. We were both furious, we turned the car around, my husband and he argued, and I completely lost my temper. When his sister found out, she was embarrassed and offered to return the phone (which my FIL refused to pay for,) neither my husband nor I felt right about that, so we dropped it. \n\nWe have now been paying for everyone's phones for two years. We have lived on our own the entirety of that time (I've had my own place since I met my husband.) My MIL has been working for a year. My SIL graduated and now is working a fairly decent job. Her boyfriend is also working but in retail. All of them live together with my FIL. \n\nMy husband suggested they begin to pay for their own phones in a month's time and the shtf. My SIL said straight out, \"No,\" like it was her decision. It was the most uncomfortable week ever. Their arguments were that it was family obligation, and that because individually they make less than us (everyone but my FIL,) that we should continue to pay.\n\nWe were holding firm in our decision, then my FIL got injured at work and went on unpaid leave. So we backed off, because that would have been messed up, and helped out with their electric bill. But, now he's working again, and I want to move forward with our plan. My husband has lost the desire to though, seeing his father in a weakened state has left him unsure of what to do here. I can get waiting but will this ever happen, should this ever happen?

            "input": "So I joined a club at my university and became fast, close friends with Michael, the president of the club. Our relationship started off a bit strange and we did things that people who aren’t just friends should do, but both of us knew it wasn’t serious and it was never like super over the top or anything. I joined pretty late in the semester though and didn’t realize that Michael was close friends with a girl named Amy.\n\nAmy was dating Ben, but I quickly found out that Michael was desperately in love with her. They were best friends and always talking and he fell HARD for her. She would tell him that even though she was dating Ben, she and Michael were meant to be together, that she was in love with him too, that they would get married right after college. Michael, meanwhile, kept attempting to convince her to breakup with her boyfriend so they could be together finally. It was a shitshow and Amy’s boyfriend was aware this was happening the whole time and would mock Michael about it constantly. There was also a lot of evidence that Amy had two boyfriends (not Michael, it was another random guy outside of our university), but Michael was blind to it and supported her 100%. Anyways, eventually it became obvious that Amy was just stringing Michael along to get a higher position of power within the club. I convinced Michael that Amy was toxic for him and that he needed to cut her off and he agreed, although he didn’t really want to and Amy ended up leaving the club. \n\nA couple of months later, he called me and told me that Ben and Amy had broken up and I told him I was really concerned because I knew they still talked sometimes and he told me that he just wanted to be there for her because he had experienced a similar breakup in the past, but that there was no romantic feelings between them still.\n\nSure enough, a couple of weeks later I find out that they’ve started dating. I know she’s no good for him whatsoever and frankly, I’m tired of having to deal with all of the drama she brings to Michael’s life. There’s a lot more details about why I just don’t support this relationship or really want to be friends with him while he’s dating her, but these are the most major reasons. I sat him down and told him that I was going to quit the club for a while because I’ve become more busy with schoolwork and that I think he and I should stop hanging out or talking. I never specifically told him it was because of Amy, but I think we both know it is. I feel like shit because he seemed so crushed and even started crying, but I absolutely refuse to clean up after his relationship with her anymore and watch him suffer while he’s with her. She might also still have that second boyfriend. So, AITA for cutting him off like this?\n\ntl;dr: Best friend is now dating a girl who we both know is super manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. She might also have a second boyfriend. Don't want to deal with it, cut him off.",

The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don’t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend’s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I’d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour’s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can’t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that’s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I’d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn’t care about the kids, I’m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don’t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?",

            "input": "5 years ago in high school I ended a 3 year long relationship with a girl (called C). C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

Found out my dead father isn't my father, it's my godfather who is estranged to us. My mother actually made him my godfather *because* she knew I was biologically his. I suspected for a decade but didn't know till I got the test\n\nBefore my bio father became estranged to us he had a son with his girlfriend. I met the son when he was a newborn. The girlfriend left with the son to another state and my bio father left us to be with her a while later. Didn't talk to him for over a decade. We still don't really talk and I found out the girlfriend became his wife and they're now completely separated. They had two more kids and he's not allowed to see them, so I can't even speak to them through him.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to look the son up since I remembered his name and realized he'd be a teenager. At one point my bio father, who lived with us at the time, was going to seek custody of him. So for a few months I anticipated this kid being my little brother.\n\nShockingly, the kid looks *exactly* like me. His childhood photos look exactly like my nephew. My sister is also my godfather's, we knew that for sure 100% for years. She took her own test and it says we're full siblings. I showed my friends and therapist his photos from his Facebook and they thought they were old photos of me with long hair. We're almost twins.\n\nSo, yeah, the kid is 16 now. He has his own Facebook and Instagram. \n\nI messaged his mother on Facebook to ask her permission to speak to him months ago. I wrote the letter with my therapist and was cordial and delicate considering the circumstances. She never responded. I was heartbroken but understood. \n\nMy mother brought the kid up the other day and said she knows I'm probably sad that I can't have a relationship with my two little brothers and sister. I told her I was going to wait till the youngest is in their 20s before reaching out (that'll be in 10 - 12 years). She said the oldest is 16 and she thinks he's old enough for me to at least PM him to introduce myself.\n\nI'm super conflicted. I don't know this kid and I don't know if he can handle something like this. On the other hand, 16 is old enough to understand. At the end of the day I want him to decide whether he wants me in his life or not, not his mother. Obviously, she can decide that for right now, but when he's an adult he can choose on his own.\n\nMy mother disagrees and thinks 16 is fine. She's under the impression that he probably wouldn't tell his mother and just talk to me. I wouldn't want to do that, however. I don't want to burn bridges or cause unnecessary issues with his mother. \n\nFamily is super important to me, especially siblings. My sisters and their kids are my best friends. Would I be the asshole if I PM'd him despite his mother indirectly telling me no? Should I wait till he's 18 or in his 20s?\n\nAdvice? Has anyone been in this situation before?",

I only have one issue with my bf, and it's that everytime he compliments me, he calls me \"hot\".\n\nI know that this is a really stupid thing to bother me but I got 2 reasons why I dislike it. The first being that I think it is a sort-of objectifying term, and it makes me think that my body is the most important thing to him. I would much rather him call me \"pretty\", \"beautiful\", or \"cute\" because I think those compliments take my personality into consideration. I feel kind of uncomfortable if he sees my sex appeal as my defining trait. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the thought behind the compliment and I find him really attractive too so I try to compliment his looks aswell. But the term \"hot\" seems to only focus on my body and sex appeal, and not to sound like a stereotype but I want our relationship to be deeper than that. (Another important note here is that me and my bf haven't had sex yet)\n\nThe other reason I don't like him calling me hot is because my ex used to use that term constantly to describe me. My ex coerced me into sex on two occasions before I found out he actually had a girlfriend who he was cheating on her with me. He used to get me incredibly drunk and then take advantage of me in some way, thankfully we only dated for a month. I never really realized it was an abusive relationship because he seemed so loving towards me, he constantly called me \"hot\". I remember specifically he would say \"you're so hot you're making me so hard right now\" to hint that I should give him a bj. I was 18 at the time and really wanted to save having my first time with a guy I knew really well and I wanted the relationship to be deeper than sex. Anyway the word \"hot\" was his go-to compliment and that's why it triggers me a little lmao.\n\nAnyway so I've been planning the next time my bf calls me \"hot\" to explain my reasons to him and ask him to use another word. I'm afraid it's gonna sound like I'm picky or ungrateful? I'm sorry if this is too small of an issue for this subreddit btw",

The overall allergy doesn't manifest as an usual cat allergy - I can be around cats, what really triggers asthma and allergy for me is dusty environment.\n\nSince I want to move in with my bf, who is from a neighbouring country with a totally different language (its Hungarian, with I understand only a few words), I have problems to find a job suitable for me - no work experience except a part time job and translation/ language related Uni aren't helping me much. At my bf apartment, I get less of allergy symptoms even if he owns 2 cats partly thanks to having a normal bed. At my parents' apartment, I sleep on a pull out futon sofa, which wasn't really build for every night sleeping on - the pull out part is wood with thin foam on top, which got worn out quickly and isn't comfortable anymore + the whole sofa is covered in cat hair collecting textile, it doesn't matter how much you try cleaning it you can't get rid of all the dust and cat hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't happy with the futon for a long time, hinted to my parents for at least 2 years that I would need a better and proper bed and they tried to compromise by buying a thin mattress to put on top and an air filter for my asthma that I have constantly running next to the sofa. Both helped somewhat, but my asthma always got back a month or so after. When I sneeze, have a runny nose and cough for several nights in a row and have to take meds and inhaler to just be able to fall asleep and feel terrible in the morning,I manage to get a big grumpy when parents don't seem to care enough, bring in more saved stray cats (have 5 in total now, but we have a big apartment so cats are doing well, no overcrowding) and tell you to just do sports outside, while the allergy doctors are alarmed my lung capacity dropped so low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I caught a cold that concentrated on flooding my lungs with slime I was coughing constantly and not getting any air when trying to sleep. The only place I could sleep was closing myself in the bathroom and sleeping on the floor with a yoga mat under me. Parents bought me a sleeping air mat, which didn't survive longer than a week, even if I tried to not let the cats near it. After the worst part of the cold went away I evacuated to my bfs appartment since my asthma still was extremly strong but I still need to get back to my parents place once in a while sice all my doctors (allergy, dentist...) are there.\n\nI still can't sleep on the futon since that cold, even with meds and parents refuse to buy me a new bed stating I can buy me one from my first salary (my parents are well off if they wanted to buy a bed its not a problem).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven my bf can't sleep on that bed well (back problems) and started to have his own first signs of allergy there.",

A friend and I hydroplaned while entering the freeway on a roundabout, which caused the little Yaris we were in to slide into oncoming traffic. We got broadsided by a semi-truck. Amazingly, we both walked away unscathed, with the exception of some back pain on my part.\n\nIn the days following the accident I had an amazing outpouring of love and affection from my friends. People brought me food, family from out of state called to check in on me, and one of my college TAs was even cool enough to drop by with some edibles to help with my back pain.\n\nTwo days after the accident I got a message from my friend Eliza asking if I wanted some company. I said yes, and asked her if she could do me a huge favor when she got here and take my trash to the dumpster. I live in a second story apartment and getting down the stairs with a bag of garbage and a bad back just seemed like a monster of a mission at the time. Eliza says of course, and everything is set.\n\nCue to a few hours later and I'm lying on my couch being stoned and pathetic. I hear a rattling at my door and in walks Eliza, who I fully expected, but she also had our friend Wren with her, who I did not expect. Wren can be a bit much in a lot of ways.\n\nAfter greetings Eliza jumps into cleaning my kitchen, which I appreciated, but I kept trying to tell her that all I needed was the trash taken out. Eliza didn't listen.\n\nI had a basket of unfolded laundry sitting in my living room. Wren jumped right into folding that. Again, I kept insisting that she did not have to do that, and again, I was ignored. At one point, she pulled a pair of my underwear out and I immediately was like, \"hey, I don't like other people touching my underwear. Please stop.\" Wren took this as an opportunity to just chuckle, then proceeded to tell me a story about the first time she went to our friend Willowe's house and how she started cleaning and Willowe was uncomfortable and visibly angry, but Wren just kept going and how she could see that same discomfort in me and how she thinks it's funny.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me. Who the hell gets off on making their friends uncomfortable?\n\nSo I told Wren straight up that she needed to stop. I said I get that she's trying to help, but honestly, I'm sore and high and feeling really violated, which is mixing with my high and giving me this weird anxiety that I really don't like. I kind of snapped. Both Eliza and Wren felt the mood change, so they both left after that and said they were going to let me rest.\n\nI've spoken to Eliza since, but not Wren, and honestly, I don't want to talk to Wren. I don't think it's out of line for me to set boundaries and I don't think it's okay to intentionally cross someone's boundaries, even if it's in the name of \"just trying to help.\"",

I bought him the key for one game and I still need to reimburse for the game that went on sale.   \n\n\n  \nLong version- Sorry if my  TL:DR didn't make a lot of sense. I am not really good with them.  \n\n\nI have a friend that wanted to play more PC games and try out certain games that I had in my steam library. Trying to be nice, I allowed him onto my steam so that he can play those games that he was interested in. I warned my friend that if he wanted to buy games then he would need to make his own account, so I wouldn't have to worry about reimbursing him for anything. Lo and behold he bought two games; one worth $20, and another worth $60. Of course, I was pretty livid, but I said I'll try to reimburse him for the games to the best of my abilities. My friend has not touched it since then, but recently asked me to reimburse him for the $60 game since I just paid him back for the $20 game. I literally had a mental breakdown because I barely have the money right now to pay back for those games since rent/utilities/etc has been kicking my ass. I confided in my boyfriend and he told me I don't need to pay him back in full; I just need to pay him back with a key.   \n\n\nI felt super guilty about it since I feel like I'm scamming him, but my boyfriend had reminded me that I had warned him about buying games on my account, and that it's not fair to me for reimbursing games that I'm not going to touch unless I'm actually interested.   \n\n\nI had asked for the receipt for the game, but he had sent me a screenshot of the first time he had bought the code. I asked where he had bought the CD code and he said amazon, and then someone else bought him another CD code for the same exact game through amazon again. And right now, there's a sale on it for $35.99 on steam. So I told him I could have just gifted me a new key for cheaper, but now he's giving me excuses about how someone else had bought the code for him and amazon doesn't do refunds as well as not providing me with the more recent receipt. I haven't replied since then as I'm still really upset about it.   \n\n\nSo AITA if I want to reimburse my friend with a new key code for a game he's interested in, instead of paying him back in full?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nP.S.-I'm sorry if my story is all over the place.

            "input": "Throwaway because I'm curious and don't know if the couple uses reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the backstory: I own my home and in order to help with costs and savings I rent out the rooms in my home. I won't get too into details about this but recently I have been struggling financially for external reasons so having room mates has become a must. I have a three bedroom home, and typically only ever rent out one other room which is across the house. I live in a fairly nice upper-middle home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I keep the place clean (I clean thoroughly once a week, I dislike messes) and all I really ask for in return is that payments are made on time and that you are kind to me and my fiancee. The rental agreement I provide is just a month-to-month agreement and it is fairly generous and lenient for the person renting the room. I do my best for background checks, personality checks, financial reviews, and etc. prior to accepting people in. The room costs typically $600 a month with a $350.00 security deposit which I return after inspection. This amount includes the monthly rent, internet, utilities, and pretty much everything minus their personal expenses. I do ask that they not let my two kittens outside (they're indoor cats) and that if they're going to use something (like plates or laundry detergent) that they just ask in advance - I'll likely say yes. For reference, the typical rent in my neighborhood for a room is about $1200, or $1800 for a one bedroom apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo due to recent financial struggles I had agreed to let a couple live with me. I figured I would give them one room with a discounted rate (Instead of $1200 for two people, it's just $800) and I would agree not to rent the second room while they are here (which means I'm earning less per month since not both rooms are rented). They did advise me they would have March as their last month as the girlfriend is pregnant and the baby would be due in late March. This was in November. I felt for them and wanted to help, and additionally I really needed the money at the time as my previous tenant had to leave on short notice (He was really nice though and we worked it out amicably, although at my financial burden).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially everything was fine but we started noticing many issues. They would drink and eat our food without asking. They would use stuff without asking. At one point early on we found one of my favorite cups was being used as a cup-holder for their toothbrushes under the sink in the guest bathroom. The girl (who is pregnant) is leaving cigarette butts outside my home and she also spends her time drinking on my patio and leaving her mess behind. They tamper with my thermostat and cause my electric bill to increase by about 60% (when I typically account for about a 40% increase with new tenants). Additionally, they started using my garage and extra room as storage despite being advised not to. I had to confront them on each issue and they pushed back either saying it wasn't them or they wouldn't do it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I'd be furious but I wanted to best assist them so I let them have these extra luxuries at no expense because it would be easier than arguing - and I also couldn't find new tenants to replace them despite my many efforts.\n\n  \nFast forward to today, the rent is due and they advise me they are leaving in two weeks and they only want to pay for half the month. Now our agreement in no uncertain terms says they need to give me a 30 days notice and they owe for the remaining thirty days. I attempt to be nice but before I can text a reply the boyfriend sends me a huge insulting text message saying \"We are leaving because you neglect your cats and they have fleas. We should've gotten a thirty day notice on the fleas and we can't live like this so we deserve to not pay you the full rent.\" Later on he agreed to pay the full amount and \"we will discuss prorating it later\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my kittens are everything to me. They're indoor cats. Me and my fiancee spoil them. Recently (as of about 15 days ago) we discovered a flea problem. Immediately we notified them, bug-bombed the house, brushed them, shampooed them, gave them anti-flea treatment and they came back again as of yesterday; so I intend to get in contact with an exterminator to see what options are available (as they may be in places I can't get to with conventional means).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ended up being a longer post than I intended so I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, but am I an asshole for demanding they pay the full rental amount as agreed by on our contract - and even more - I provided them official thirty day notice as of today to vacate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accepted a pregnant couple into my home with a month-to-month agreement. They're trashy people and I've been nothing but kind while they drink and smoke on my patio together. Today they asked me to only pay a part of their rent and leave early, violating our monthly agreement which puts me in a rough financial spot.",

I had an ok relationship with my parent who I don’t live near, lets call them parent #2 but it was a very stressful. My parents split was very messy and parent #2 alway tried to make it a pick parent #1 or me and was always pushing to spend every moment with them. I understand that they just have me and my sibling, but I also had to deal with the burden of constantly making me feel like I was guilty for any decision I made regarding time spent with parent #1 or parent #2. Parent #2 also argued that they didn’t have to support me if I didn’t see them enough and since the day I turned 18 even when I still saw #2 on an almost daily basis they did not support me financially. \n\nAfter moving I was basically pressured into visiting once after only 3 months even when I had a visit planned for about six months out. Well not parent #2 wants me to keep up a 3 month routine and honestly I don’t want to see #2 that often. #2 just always makes me feel like crap and pressures me into things I don’t want to do. Now don’t get me wrong I still like #2 but its just shitty to be pressured to do everything. They act like they give me options, but I know that the options aren’t really options. I’d be more than fine if #2 wanted to come visit me, but I’m tired of flying across country and taking off time (over a week each time) from work every 3 months. When I split my time almost 50/50 between my parents life was hell because I had to constantly listen to the bickering. It wasn't everyday, but it would got to the point of me having to leave the house a couple of times out of fear or anger. There were many good times during those years, but many taxing days as well.\n\nTo understand my situation a little better I’m a full time student and work 40 hours a week so I’m busy, but I like it and still want time to do my own things. I guess I might be selfish, but at this point I don’t know. I also don’t want to disagree with parent #2 because there parents have a college fund for me that will pay for a half of year, which is a lot of money for me. It almost feels like I just have that pressure of money looming over me. Plus I still love a lot of my family on that side, but its just tough because I don’t want to upset them by making parent #2 upset and they won’t see it my way, they never have but they don’t hold it over me.\n\nSo I ask, am I the asshole for not wanting to see #2 every 3 months? Also should I good see #2 or should I stand my ground?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go way further in depth with the stories, but I don't want to be too specific.",

Then, I gave my point that it would be the same as if he is a weeb.\n\nMy point is that somebody might be interested in some topic if they actually deeply understand that topic. Like my friend, I think he might be (and he is) a weeb because he knows a lot about anime, like the characters, the series, etc. It is the same if someone is a fan of something. They must have knowledge of someone that they fan of, like their birthday, their real name, their songs, etc. It's because if someone has the interest of a topic, they will have the curiosity to learn the topic further because of how interesting it is. It is simple logic, I suppose.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend is having anger because of it, calling that if I were having a debate with that type of reasoning, then I will be boo'ed. Basically, he calls my point is utterly stupid. I tried to explain as clear as possible, but I think he doesn't understand what am I saying.

They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n",

She has this friend (J) that about 3 years ago, down in Mexico, got drunk and started talking bad about my wife (then my GF) in front of strangers the entire day and then at the end of the night, got into a physical altercation with my wife.  My wife called me at like 2:00am from Mexico, crying, told me what happened and said she was driving off in the rental car to get to the airport (she left J in the hotel room) and was coming home.  The entire way back to the States she kept calling me upset, etc.  J was also going through a divorce at the time because she got busted cheating on her husband with a coworker, who she also gave herpes to.  My wife has known J for 20 years.  J is also in her 40s.  \n\nAfter the Mexico thing happened, my wife told me she was going to cut J out of her life because she didn't need toxic people like that around her.  I thought this was a wise move.  My wife hasn't heard much from J over the past 3 years but has received the occasional reach out, \"I'm sorry\" type of text to which she replied politely to but never more than that.  My wife has said, when she chooses to shut a door, it stays shut.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago, my wife runs into J at a store and J starts crying and saying how sorry she was, etc.  My wife tell me this and I can only say that I don't like J but ultimately it was not really my thing, it was between her and J.\n\nMy wife got very defensive and said I wasn't supportive and that I only know bad stuff about J (which is true) and that we have all done stupid things like J did in Mexico.  I said yeah, maybe when I was like 21 or something, sure I may have gotten drunk and gotten rowdy but even then I don't remember cutting my friends down to make me look better and then fighting with them and I sure as hell don't remember doing anything like that in my 40s.\n\nI said from what I know of J she is unstable, selfish, toxic, mean, etc and I don't think she has a place in my life but if you want to give her a chance, that is up to you, just don't expect me to like her because I don't.\n\nThis turned into a major fight with my wife about how I should be supportive and how I don't really know J.  I told my wife, \"up until a few days ago, you thought the same way I did and only changed once you ran into J\".  \n\nI'm not sure what my wife wants from me.  I don't think many mid 40s women act like J did.  I don't want any drama or crazy around my wife or kids.  I can understand how J has good qualities as well but I just don't have a good vibe about her, even less so now that J is single and doing God knows what.\n\nNow, my wife thinks I'm an asshole and all I was really trying to do was be honest about how I felt.  I haven't changed my mind, I still don't like J and I think she is trouble but I will try and be supportive of my wife for my wife's sake.\n\nAITA?\n",

I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.",

            "input": "Sorry in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI have a friend who lives down the street. I met him when I was 13 and he was 15. We were extremely close and most of the things I enjoyed were because of him, (Basketball, Volleyball, Card Games, Some Online Games), but thats besides the point. A little before he turned 16 he got his first car (‘99 Honda Civic $1000) that was perfect except for how it looked. We often went places and I never “mocked” him for having a bad / old looking car because in my eyes it was perfectly fine for a car. \n\nFast forward by about 2yrs he’s 17 and I’m around \n1 1/2 months from my birthday. He worked hard and got his parents to agree to price match a new car for him. He put $1800 in for a ‘07 Mustang ($3100) and his parent matched him with the extra going towards the small bit of needed fixes. I was extremely happy for him and even joined him when he drove to go to repair places to get the standard new car fixes like oil changes. The only real problem with the car was a slightly bent hood, something you couldn’t notice from more than 10ft away. \n\nFast forward a month and now its 2 weeks before my 15th birthday and since I know my family didn’t want to pay much for my car I was expecting something basic similar to my friends first car. Since I have to drive 40 miles to and from school everyday when I get my license we has to get something with low miles and high mpg. While I was sitting in my room doing nothing my mom knocked on my door and told me to come outside. What was waiting there for me? A red ‘02 Camaro! ($3200, small paint problems and a few things needed replacing but no major problems). I was so happy and excited for my permit so I could drive but the first thing I did was text my friend saying I got my new car and to come over.\n\nI heard/saw his car coming up to my house but instead of stopping, he just drove right pass. It confused me a small bit so I asked my dad if he could drive me to his house with my new car to ask his opinion but when we go in front of his house we saw him get out of his car (with his brother and friend, both I know semi-well) and walk right past us into his house. I was kinda bummed knowing that he was mad but normally he gets over things after a little while so I let it be and texted him 1 week later about going to a volleyball open gym that we normally go to. These are the texts.\n\nMe: You going to volley?\nHim: Maybe why?\nMe: Bc I’m going and wanted to know if you’re driving\nHim: Well why don’t you drive? You’ve got a nice new car.\n\nThis was before I got my permit. \nThe rest of the conversation went similarly with him kinda saying things that made it sound like I’m a huge asshole and was getting mad about how my car was a little more expensive and that I didn’t work for it. Eventually I told him that when he got his car I was happy for him so now he should just grow up and be happy for me.\n\nThere was another point when he said that my parent’s buy everything for me which other the my first good pc (Christmas 2015 ~$1000) I have bought anything over $50 by myself. Ex. Oculus Rift, Xbox One, PS4, PS4 1TB, my current computer specs (~$1300), my shoes (totaling ~$260), my 3ds xl ($120) and pretty much anything over $50. The only times I get something is during my birthday/christmas which even then never go above $200. He get things given to him worth the same to more than I do. Ex 2 pairs of nice shoes after getting honor role on a report card.\n\nIf you couldn’t tell by that rant this is what really got\nme annoyed and stop texting him. I haven’t talked to him at all since (4 months) but whenever I think about it I get really annoyed. I understand where he’s coming from, he had to work but I didn’t, but he doesn’t have to treat me like everything is my fault. \n\nThis is the story but the question is, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My parents payed for my first car that was around the same price as my friend’s 2nd car that he price matched with his parents to get. ($3200 against $3100 split 2-ways). Now he’s mad at me.\n\n",

I know stories involving abuse are touchy here because it usually falls under the 'validation seeking' post category, but I swear I've thought this over. I'm never this divided when it comes to my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My mother was abusive so I stopped reacting to anything she did, but recently I've caught myself becoming more and more cruel towards her, to the point that when she said she just wanted to die, I asked her why she hadn't. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background: my mother has been abusive as far back as I can remember (so, since I was 7 years old.) It went from degrading my physical appearance to attempting to kill me a few times. I'm not blind - I know what she did was horrible. I'll never forgive her for it. \n\nHowever, I've been acting like a real piece of shit the past couple days, or maybe even weeks. She's been trying to be nice ever since I ran away a month or so ago, I can tell, but apparently that just makes me more angry. She hasn't been too abusive in a few months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the actual story. Two days ago, I was in my room, getting nothing done as usual. My mother comes in, obviously wanting to talk about the meeting she'd had the day before with my maths teacher (about me missing way too many classes and my grades dropping.) She asked - in a sweet voice that made me want to punch her in the face (goes to show how weirdly I've been reacting these days) - why I'd been missing those classes, listing off potential reasons. I'd had a less than ideal day, so I just wanted to be left alone, and I got annoyed really easily. I snapped. \n\nUnfortunately she just cranked up the whiny tone. Started talking about how hard this was for her (which I get, honestly, but in that moment I wasn't hearing it), and eventually she said the magic words \"I want to die from how tired I am because of you.\" \n\nI was too mad at that point to watch my mouth so I just asked her \"why not do it, then\" in a complete deadpan. I wasn't looking at her so I'm not sure what her immediate reaction was, but when she next spoke I'm pretty sure I heard choking up. \n\nI felt nothing in that moment. That's what makes me so conflicted. I didn't even think in that moment, I let myself go and stooped to her level. Said the words she used to say to me. Afterwards, thinking it over, I felt bad - not for her, not really, but for having been that much of a shithead to anybody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two entirely different parts of me that are at odds right now. Half of me just wants to dismiss it - I want to tell myself that I'm not the asshole, that I'm justified because of what she did to me before. But the other half is reminding me that no matter what, it doesn't change the fact that I practically told someone to kill themselves. And she's been trying to do better, I'm just actively making it hard for her. That's definitely asshole material. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I need help in figuring this out. I don't care about the verdict, I just need to know so that I can try to change whatever I may need to change. Thank you :)",

We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her.

My issue is the volume. We live in a tiny studio apartment for one, and he’s a generally loud person. I have issues with loud sounds. When he talks loudly it makes it hard for me to engage in the conversation and it stresses me out (I’ve tried to explain this to him). I also had to leave almost immediately to go teach a class, another reason why I was stressed and wasn’t into him talking so loudly. \n\nAt the core of it, I feel like it wasn’t worth him getting so pissed about!!

Never cleaned up after himself, whole house smelled like mold and cigarettes, walls FILTHY with grime and nicotine. He looked and dressed in a way that made him look as though he did not live inside. He acted like a fool in public, yelling obscenities even on public transportation. At first, it was a minor inconvenience, but after time it started to wear on me. A month or so in, I started letting him know that I didn't want our friendship to be impacted by our roommate situation, and I could use help maintaining the apartment's cleanliness, which he essentially ignored until I had a breakdown about the communal areas being absolutely filthy to the point I couldn't bring anyone over without cleaning for several hours.  \n\n\nI have since been rewarding his good behavior with dab oil (we're in WA state, totally legal) and hot fresh meals, since I know he hates cooking. When he trashes a room and leaves it that way, I just ignore his mess and keep cleaning my own, while making food simply for myself. Once he's cleaned, I make a nice big communal meal for the both of us, almost always complete with fresh baked desserts. While he's in the shower, I drive to the dispensary for oil and dab out when he's done. I even slip his bus fare back into his change from food stores when he's not paying attention, if he hasn't been cursing and obnoxious on the bus.

            "input": "So, some backstory first. This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise. I know this is making him nervous and paranoid and putting his heart at risk, but frankly he would be nervous and paranoid anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Life makes my dad nervous and he wants me to never do anything ever, he watches me to make sure I never do anything. I recently realized I am an adult and can ignore him so I do stuff anyway. Turns out I like doing stuff.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for ignoring my dad's anxiety and not staying home with a rambunctious preschooler, even though it could possibly help him avoid a third heart attack?",

Recently, I joined a partial hospitalization program (PHP) for my depression, suicidal thoughts, self esteem issues, and anxiety.\n\nIt's been a rough start. I constantly feel like everyone hates me and no one wants to see my ugly face, so I don't talk a lot of the time. I think that people won't like me because I'm gross and overweight. When people do approach me, I can't seem to hold the conversation. I'm awful at keeping up a chat because I usually give one-word answers, and that's because I'm either not interested in the topic or am deathly afraid of saying the wrong thing. I have a huge fear of screwing up when saying or doing something around others.\n\nAll of this makes me quiet, reserved, and atrocious at talking, thus making me not appealing to everyone else in the program. I see people giving me weird looks sometimes when I sit in the academics room while everyone else socializes. And by everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. They all know each other well, but I just can't make the effort to try and talk to them because I hate butting into conversations. That's because I'm terrified of people thinking that I'm annoying.\n\nBasically, I'm not social. I don't talk, I don't participate in discussions, and I definitely don't approach people on my own to try and make friends. It's all due to my overwhelming fear of others disliking me. And I know that people think lowly of me because I overheard two girls whispering about how 'weird' I was. That really got to me, and it still gets to me. But, since I'm too scared to try and change my image, I'm stuck being the weird quiet kid.

She decided yeah, she should get an abortion. I tried to make sure it was HER decision and not his, since she'd been into it before she talked to him. She said stuff about not wanting to raise a child as a single parent (I'm a single mom, so that stung, but it's not my life) and planned on going through with it. Sadly, she ended up miscarrying. She was upset but, I think, somewhat relieved. Life went on. About a year later, she met another guy who was also Bad News, in and out of drug rehab and halfway houses, definitely not relationship material, but she jumped right in with him and quickly got pregnant. This time, she admitted she wanted to get pregnant, planned it, and wanted to keep the baby. She was even more excited, we were talking baby showers, she wanted me at the birth, we talked names, she was ordering personalized onesies to break the news to her parents. I was still in another state, but I was there for her every way I could be during those weeks. She went to the doctor and sent me an ultrasound photo, and I cried and fell even more in love with this little blob. But then... her Bad News guy had to go back to rehab. He was having a lot of mental health issues, including dissociative identity disorder, bipolar, and others. It became clear that he was not fully able to be in a relationship with her because of his issues with drugs and mental health. Once he went back to rehab and my friend realized she was alone, she decided she wanted to get an abortion. This time, I was shocked. She was excited, she loved the baby, she wanted the baby, she planned for this. She got me involved, excited, and in love with this baby then so suddenly changed her mind. We didn't talk much about it. She told me after she had the procedure, and I checked in to make sure she was okay. It's been about a year and we are still close friends but we don't talk about it.

However the best she could get is her lawyer fees taken of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother wants justice to be done but I feel like she just sinking her money into something and she never get it back.

Fred will shave and leave a ton of hairs all around the sink. He will use my bathroom stuff and I'm a woman. He refuses to clean. He's never once cleaned the bathroom, living room, or any other place. He smells like BO and leaves weed and ash and roaches everywhere. Instead of taking the garbage out, he will stack trash and leave us to take care of it. \n\nThe last straw was when he got sick from what I'm pretty sure was norovirus (aka stomach flu). I was in the living room yesterday morning and he was on the couch.  He gets up, stumbles through the hallway and throws up all over the floor. I immediately think \"uhoh\". \n\nI tell him to try and stay away from the living room so we don't get sick. He doesn't listen and hangs out in the living room. He cleans his mess but left his trash outside near the front door in a plastic bag. I told him to leave my dog alone and not pet him. He didn't listen, so now I can't cuddle my dog. He's also not washing his hands. \n\nSo I'm in the bathroom with bleach, gloves and a mask desanitizing everything (which I get, because he wasn't in a condition to clean). I've done EVERYTHING I can to stay away from him. I am not eating in the house, not anything. I threw away my toothbrush just in case particles got on there while he was puking his guts out. \n\nI came back from class today and put on my mask. He irritatingly says I don't need it as if I am overreacting. He says it was \"food poisoning\" and to not worry. If he knew anything, norovirus can be food poisoning and that's incredibly contagious. He's getting irritated with me and tells me I act like his mom because I tell him to clean. If I get sick I am not going to let him live this down.  \n\nAnd I'll probably move out. I know norovirus is really contagious and even the most clean of people get it, but if I get sick from HIM I think I'll be too disgusted with him to look at him. Just imagining him stumbling into the hallway with heavy feet and puking all over the floor like a child makes me sick. If I get sick I know I'm going to really go off on him. \n\nAnd I mean yell. I won't be able to control it and I'm going to blow up. I need to know if this makes me an asshole. I can't take it anymore. I honestly want to just land a big fat punch right on his face because he is always trying to get in fights (he got into a fight with my friends once and broke his nose). \n\nTL;DR my disgusting roommate (probably) got norovirus, isn't sanitizing anything and is heightening the chances of get me sick and I want to go off on him so badly after this last straw. \n\n",

It was by no means always harmonious, but we always thought our relationship was worth fighting for. I’m not a greedy bitch when it comes to money. I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.) He paid the rest, but he didn’t have enough to pay half because he started working a new job after me. I moved out after we broke up and now I’m demanding he pay half of what I paid for the rent, $450, considering I’m in a shitty situation (No savings, but I did manage to get a job I haven’t started). At first, he said he would help, but he of course spent money on partying for ST. P. I asked him yesterday when he was going to pay me, he said he couldn’t give it to me in full because he has court. \n\nWhen I tell y’all I’m fucking livid!! I feel absolutely used. He has a great job now and I feel like he truly won’t pay me back because he has no self-awareness and truly doesn’t care. Part of me wants karma to play out and just leave it, the other part of me wants to hit that bitch up every day until he pays me back.\n\nSo AITA for demanding the rent money back? Or do I just look foolish and should let it go?",

She is sweet, but she is a little off. Overall, she doesn’t like people. She will come out and snuggle with you when It is very quiet and you are typically laying on the couch relaxing. The problem is that when you are not home, she comes out and lays on all of the furniture and pees on it. We have taken her to the vet several times and spent thousands of dollars on her. There isn’t a  medical solution, she is incontinent. \n\nFor the most part, she likes to be alone. My husband feels guilty that she is alone downstairs. But I contend that she has food and a safe space to live in a controlled setting where if she pees on something, that it isn’t a big deal. He is upset that I don’t go and spend more time with her downstairs to interact. I admit that I don’t do what I should,  but my husband doesn’t either, and his reasoning for not going down there is that “there isn’t anything to do down there”.   I told my husband that she is fine to come upstairs and be allowed to Rome around, if I can replace anything she ruins that she pees on. He then argues that I don’t have a realistic sense of smell. I feel really discounted by this given that I am miserable in areas the cat has been around.\n\nMy husband is seriously the love of my life but this freaking cat seems to come between us. Do I need to just accept the smell of cat pee? Am I being a total jerk keeping her In the basement? I love animals and want to make sure she is taken care of, but I am needing help from you guys in establishing what the line is. My husband discounts my experience in smelling all of the cat piss.

We dated for 2 years and his drinking became too much for me to handle so i moved out in May. We stayed friends. A few weeks ago we had sex because I missed hanging out with him and he had mentioned he wasnt drinking so much anymore, gave me some hope that we could try again.  But afterwards he told a girl we work with that we were having sex again. She in turn told at least 5 other people that I know of and suddenly everyone is asking me if we are dating. So, normally this wouldnt be a big deal, it's just gossip. But when we had sex the condom slipped off and I had to go get Plan B to ensure no preggers would happen. I also think he posted something publically about us having sex, in snapchat or something similar, because the day after i went to PP some rando on the internet posted an ad for prostitution services on my page. It's very catholic in my area, lots of prolifers who think women should be punished for having control over their reproductive organs. I assumed the prolifers found out and were trying to shame me for going to PP. After this happened i became deeply concerned that the local PP had shared my personal info, violating a HIPAA, and was going to report them. But when I started hearing people from work talking about me and my ex, my next assumption was that  it was my ex who had told. I confronted him and he admitted he had drunkenly told our mutual coworker. That was 2 days ago. Then yesterday he sends me a text saying it wasnt her, supposedly he was so drunk he doesnt remember. Obviously starting this relationship again before knowing more about his sobriety status is my fuckup. I accept that. But would i be the asshole for breaking things off with him specifically because he talks about our private lives openly? He says I'm the one who has broken his trust but I dont see how. ",

It's been rocky for me, because my parents kicked me out after I'd turned 18 and finished high school-- to explain more in detail, I'd originally been planning on joining the military immediately after HS and had been recruited and training for nearly a year for boot, but things fell through once it was realized that I have serious issues with depression, ADHD, &amp; PTSD (these things can disqualify you from being able to serve). A few weeks after I graduated HS, things began to explode at my home. I was equal parts frustrated with myself for not having any idea what to do now/how to get my life on track, while also juggling what I now knew for a fact to be mental disorders, and also being upset with the psychologically&amp;physically abusive treatment my parents forced on me and my siblings. So I got literally kicked to the curb.\n\nA friend's parents took me in and got me started heading in the right direction. I applied to stuff, got accepted, and thanks to the FASFA my parents had filled out at a high school thing earlier in the year, I was able to afford to go through loans, scholarships, and jobs. My parents have re-done the FASFA for me yearly, but other than that we are not on speaking terms and they give me no financial support, period. I'm homeless outside of the school year and generally spend time with my long-time partner's family in summer/on holidays, helping to pay bills.\n\nMy parents ain't great. I have PTSD thanks to them, and my depression has been exacerbated, if not directly caused by their actions towards me and my siblings when I was young. It's also all but confirmed I have DID because of the long-term abuse too. But recently, my parents have began to make attempts to reach out to me, inquiring about my graduation so that they can come and telling me how upset all my siblings are that they haven't seen me in almost four years.\n\nI think they want to reconnect with me. But, I hate them since they abused me so badly for 18 years and fucked me up on such an unfixable level. I'm going to have to live with my issues for **the rest of my life** and I resent them for that. But we're related even if I wish we weren't and I'd be a lying if I said that people can't change. I don't know if I could ever forgive&amp;forget, but I don't know if it'd even be fair to deny them the opportunity to come to my college graduation, especially since I *couldn't* have done it without the FASFA loans I took out. \n\nWith all this said, I kinda want to give them a hard no and ban them from attending my graduation, even despite their requests. Instead, I really want to give my graduation tickets to my partner's family who has taken me in all those summers and holidays. ",

I said I’d love to go cos it’s my favourite band and FA gave me the details and I’m pretty much set on going. My other friend (FB) asked if he could go too. Now I have absolutely nothing against FB and I would consider him one of my closest friends and FA feels the same way, we just don’t think he’d really enjoy it as he’s never listened to any of the bands songs, doesn’t like their music, and would hate the overall experience. I’m talking crowded places and mosh pits. I’ve known FB for years and he’s told me before how he doesn’t like that stuff. He would feel really awkward, we’d feel really awkward and probably miss out on doing mosh pits and stuff cos we can’t abandon him. We haven’t said a thing to him and don’t know how to go about letting him down. We see him real often and FA sees him for 3 hours every day at college.

            "input": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom.\n\nProbably one of many similar posts - I know it's never possible to give full details, but I'll try. My family suffers from a range of mental challenges/conditions/illnesses: ADHD, Aspergers, depression, substance abuse, gender identity, anxiety. Although miraculously none of the uglier symptoms present themselves around friends or guests, they all come out in the wash during family holidays. This year, the parents rented a cottage in the middle of nowhere, so we will all be stuck together with no place to go.\n\nThis Thanksgiving has been a foretaste of what I fear will happen come Christmas. In just the last two days, I've been through enough mental illness crap to make me not want to come for Christmas. One sister had a two-hour violent meltdown over playing MineCraft (she's 11) that resulted in my father having to restrain her about six times. The other has ignored the houseguest from Japan she brought home from college (who, unfortunately, has had to witness all this going on), and freaked out during a board game: there was some confusion over a move that did not involve her: my family tends to get loud and talk over each other and that triggered her anxiety which resulted in her throwing a fit and her game pieces and storming out of the house. Just today I was yelled at for 'always looking for an argument': my mother announced her intention to shut off the internet for several hours to install a new router and I observed that I (and the Japanese exchange student) were working on online classwork. I'm typing this expecting the internet to shut off at any moment - I retreated to a closed room to avoid further conflict over the issue.\n\nI have tried to adopt the perspective that my role is to be a peacemaker as much as possible (e.g, acquiescing to simple demands, being a kind host to this poor Japanese girl and just talking to her). However, this Thanksgiving has made me feel that I am horrible in that role. I will admit that their behavior does not always bring out the best in me - I do not take well to my sister hitting and kicking my parents or the dog, for example. I am fully aware that some of this behavior is beyond my family's control; however, it is frustrating to see it under control around friends/guests, but receive the full brunt of it over political discussions, or even stupid things like games. Part of the reason I'm considering cancelling my Christmas ticket is so I won't end up becoming one of several assholes over Christmas.\n\nI fully anticipate that between the various diagnoses and differences on politics and religion that there will be several shitshows come Christmas. However, this holiday is the one time of year my entire family gets together. We will also have a bit of extended family joining us, too. If I don't show, it will be noticed and talked about, and break my parents' and grandparents' hearts. I've also had to pay nearly $1000 for Christmas travel, which I will only get about $600 back in the form of travel vouchers if I cancel. I have no idea what the alternative would be, as I don't have another family to 'adopt' me for the holidays (e.g., SO).\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for skipping family Christmas to avoid conflict aggravated by mental illness, knowing that it will hurt my family deeply if I don't come?",

Last week she scheduled a call to talk about the edits on Tuesday of this week. I build in a few week buffer for myself so a week delay isn't a big deal. Then she rescheduled to Thursday (today) because she's got a minor surgical procedure and doesn't want to have to come into the office that soon. Again this is fine. Today she sends me a \"Hey I still can't come in, I have to reschedule for tomorrow afternoon.\" She has a quirk about sending the edits without a meeting and I usually just let her do her thing because the meetings are short. But now I'm getting irritated because this is turning into two weeks of delay and I'll be squeezed for time because of other projects. I know she has a medical issue, but I'm ready to ask her boss to intervene and just send me the document so I get started. Is that an asshole move?",

About 98% of the girls at my school are feminists and they believe in sexual liberty including myself, and her.

Recently, she even posted a picture of her friend, Adi, and captioned each picture with shit like 'dickilious' and 'don't worry, I have those in my mouth all the time'. Another time, she posted a selfie and captioned it with 'I need a dick in me, right now!' \n\nShe once posted a picture of a girl wearing panties that read 'dinner's on me'. Another time she started making those bottom text memes, and all of them were hella provocative, with one saying 'get into bed and remove your clothes, now!'\n\nI'm all about being free with your sexuality, and talking about sex, but keep in mind she's 15. It feels inappropriate watching her post this stuff. But I also don't know whether me telling her not to would come off as wrong, because it is her profile and her posts, not mine. If I really am uncomfortable, I should just unfollow her, right? \n\nBut at the same time, I feel like it is wrong for someone her age to post stuff that says she needs a dick in her.\n\nI don't want to take any stupid actions that would make her angry and me seem overbearing.\n\nSo, WIBTA?",

It was most definitely not a clean breakup, and it all went down in flames. In one of our last arguments (over text), she told me that while we were talking about getting back together she had already hooked up with this one other guy. After that, she gave my number to him and he started trolling my social media and insulting me, my family, and my friends while alluding that my ex told him a bunch of secrets I told her when we were together, and started rattling off on some sensitive things.\n\nThis pissed me off, and in retaliation I told him he should stop wasting his time talking to me and go fuck my ex, because she's \"easy\" and immediately sent him a bunch of explicit images of her she had sent me. They weren't nudes, as she was fully clothed, but they were provocative pictures of her in her underwear and making semi-sexual poses. This is something I know would immensely embarrass her and they both blocked me after that.\n\nMonths later, I have a new SO and my ex tries to get in touch with her. She says that she's been going to therapy and her therapist supposedly told her to get in touch with me or someone close to me in order to get closure, but she then does this by bad-mouthing me. My current SO tells her to fuck off and then tells me about it. I felt pissed for a while, but then I started feeling sorry for her and that I genuinely do want to give closure, not just for her but for myself too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I tried to?

We were both abused, and we have a lot in common, including PTSD. We both hate asking for help because if an abuser helps you it means you owe them something. So, I made a lot of excuses for him.\n\nAbout 6 months ago he got fired and went into a deep depression. I have been drowning financially but supported him and he was unemployed the entire 6 months. I asked him to get help and he refused. It got to the point where I would be homeless if I didn't kick him out and start over in a new, smaller/cheaper place. \n\nSo I did. But we continued to see each other. He's been resentful and emotionally abusive on and off. He stayed the night and then started moving stuff in and we got in a fight because he doesn't respect my boundaries and I said he can't live here until he starts helping and gets his shit together.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. I broke it off.\n\nThis happened yesterday. Tonight he came here begging me to stay the night because he \"has nowhere else to go,\" and would be fucked without his storage key. None of this is true. He lost the key a few days ago. It isn't here. Also he yelled at me and called me names earlier today and OH HE DOES HAVE PLACES TO GO. Now I'm not saying it's ideal, but he has plenty of loving friends who would help him. But he's a stubborn ass and I promise he's going to sleep in the street tonight out of spite and obstinance, and try to get me to let him in tomorrow.\n\nHe's got a really sweet friend who offered for him to stay with her and her fiance and I know he hasn't told them what's going on out of shame. Should I call her and let her know? \n\nPlease keep this in mind: I love this man. He's a jackass, but the both of us have survived trauma worse than most people and poverty. If we weren't stubborn, we'd be dead already. And frankly I'm not mad. I feel awful. I am sad. \n\nAm I the asshole, or would I be if I called his friend and asked her to try and get through to him? \n\nSorry for jumbled explanation. I'm a little emotional still. He just left. ",

It's clear as day that no one likes Ashley. She is very rude, to not only Sam, but to me, our other friends we all hang out with, and just everyone around her. She is a total bitch IMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere Sam goes, she's there. When we decide to have a \"Guys\" night, she tags along. When she does, she's nothing but selfish, rude and talking constant shit while always touching and totally showing PDA. The PDA is the worst part. Sam is always paying for her food, meals, giving her rides to school then work. For context, Sam isn't the most...Fortunate man in the world. He's not poor, but nowhere near rich. He's about almost at low class citizen area. SHE comes from a very rich family. Has a million dollar house, lives in the best city, has cars from a Tesla Model X, to a Mercedes S-Class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, he's totally submissive to her and does whatever she wants. Sam is giving it his all for Ashley and she is literally just saying, \"Meh. Pay for my food.\" Sam is currently balancing 2 jobs and high school while Ashley doesn't even have one. The relationship is totally lopsided and it's clear as day that Sam is whipped. There was a time where Ashley slept in the same bed as one of her cousin's friends at her house. And she claimed nothing happened. And of course, Sam believed her and laughed it off. He's even bought her a $200 necklace she has never worn before. Which was about 2 paychecks for him. She bought him a hat. He wears the shit out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't even tell her parents until there 1 year anniversary, which was sketchy as hell in my opinion. He will go out literally every weekend to her house at 1am to go spend the night at her house to avoid her parents. Keep in mind they live about 30 minutes away. And he is always going over to her house. She's been to his house once and that was a few months ago. Sam moved about a month later and she hasn't even seen it yet. She is a terrible girlfriend and it's clear as day she is whipped, so WIBTA if I tell him he's whipped? Providing all the information and proof that says so. Or should I just keep my mouth shut and let him find out the hard way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Best friend is clearly whipped due to the influx of things he does for his girl, pays for every meal, drives out to her house every weekend which is a 30 min drive away, buys her expensive jewelry, she's a freeloader and yet she's extremely rich. He is pretty low class. She has been suspected of even cheating (which she probably has.) Our whole group hates her and thinks the same of her. Should I tell him he's whipped or just let him find out the hard way?",

It had been assigned for almost a month at that point, and the due date was literally a day away. Normally I'd love to help, but at that time I was busy with homework of my own, and I generally didn't want to replan my schedule. Now I told him that I really didn't want to, and to ask others if they could do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while of him asking, I agreed to do it, but on the condition that his group would pay me for the editing work, much like if they had hired an editor. I receive the files later that day, and I begin to work. Now keep in mind, this project was due the next day, I had a physical limitation of 14 hours to finish IF I stayed up all night. After a lot of complications, I finally get it done with the help of another friend, and I call this guy's group to give it to them. I ask my co editor if he wanted anything, but he just said he was fine and went to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point it was almost 3 in the morning, and I had been working on the edit for a total of 5 hours or so. I tell them the thing's finished and ask for $50. They refuse and argue about why the price is so high. I didn't really think this was that high of a price, as I had spend many hours on it, and delayed my own homework to rush it out on time. After some more arguing, I just wanted everything to be over. I had school the next day and the most I was gonna get then was 5 hours of sleep. In the end I just told them to take the video, but if they could pay me that'd be really nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few months to my birthday. This was still a while ago, and I hadn't gotten any of the money from any of the people. I didn't want to make a big deal out of my birthday, I just changed my mood message and mentioned it if anyone asked. Generally for other people's birthdays, if I didn't know them well enough for a personal gift, I'd just give them $10 worth of gift cards in something like steam or amazon. Some of my friends knew I played this game alot, and gifted me some skins and premium currency. I was pretty content with how things turned out. The friend I edited for didn't get my anything but I wasn't really caught up on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day at school, I see him at one of my classes. He sort of pulls me to the side and hands me a $10 bill. When I asked him what it was for he replied that he was paying back the money he owed me for the editing (there were 5 people in that group, they split the cost evenly, I still hadn't gotten the other $40). I feel like it would've almost been better if he didn't get me anything at all. Paying me for a job I did as a birthday gift just kind of feels wrong, and I don't really want to get him a gift again this year for his birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking this way?",

He responded with, “That’s why I’m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend”. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren’t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, “Don’t talk shit then”. He’s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don’t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I’m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven’t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he’s making my blood boil and it’s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. ",

This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI’m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she’s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.” We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe’s taken from my account without my okay before. I’ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn’t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying “IT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?",

I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake. I admit I made very poor choices; I’ve learned from them and matured as a driver since. \n\nThe man (a very big, early 40’s guy) at the next red light, got out of his car, stormed up to my window, and went ballistic. He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. I’m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed he’s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nI’m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guy’s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash. AITA for wanting to take some revenge on this guy who viciously terrorized my children and I?",

            "input": " \n\nFirstly, my (20m) girlfriend (19f) and I have been very very happily dating for just over 5 months now. We are each other's emotional support through everything and we do everything together. Very recently, my phone broke down and I do not have the financial means to obtain a new one at the moment, so she being the saint that she is let me borrow her old phone that she kept around. When it has WiFi I can use things like snapchat and instagram just so I can contact her.\n\nIn using her old phone, all of her old apps and pictures (including her tinder) are available to me. She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever. I respect her boundaries and privacy, and figure most of the stuff I would find in there happened before we ever even met and I would not be happy with what I saw, so why even bother.\n\nThe problem here arrives when I received a notification about a day after I received her phone to use. I got a notification from instagram, but as her account. At this point I had not used the app yet, so her account was still signed in. However, when I opened the app to see what was up, it prompted me to log in - I could not use her account, yet I was still getting notifications from it. It was at this point that I was going to sign in with my own credentials so as to not get her notifications, but what I actually did I am slightly ashamed of. I read the notification and saw that it was not from anybody she normally talks to, or anybody that I know. It was from a man our age that goes to our university, and the contents of the messages made me not want to sign out. I became extremely anxious because his messages went something like this:\n\n\\- \"Hey\" (11pm the night before I saw)\n\n\\- \"Good morning Beautiful\" (the first notification I saw in the morning)\n\n\\- \"Were you at so-and-so's concert last night? I think I saw you\" (I took her to a nearby musician's concert for a celebration, I bought her tickets and just the two of us went)\n\n\\- \"What are you doing later?\"\n\nNow I cannot see her messages that she is responding to him because since I am receiving her notifications, I am only getting his messages. I do know that she was responding though based on the fact that he liked one of her messages that she sent to him. I also know that after the last message he sent there was no other contact. She does not have him on any other form of social media, so instagram notifications would let me know if anything else happened. I do not know what she said, if anything, to the last message.\n\nSo I suppose this is the question - AITA for not signing out of her account upon seeing those types of messages? Should I confront her about this, or let it slide for now as he seems to have stopped talking to her?",

I'm in the process of getting evaluated for a transplant, and my first appointment with the transplant centre is next week.

The plan right now is for just my parents to be tested.\n\n  One of my friends is adamant that she wants to be tested to see if she's a match, and if she is a match she wants to be the one to give me a kidney. She's an extremely stubborn and driven individual and has very firmly made her mind up on this. We also know already that we're a blood type match, so there is a solid chance that she would be a potential donor. \n\n  The thing is, I don't like the idea of her donating for a couple of reasons. First off, the condition I have has a high rate of reoccurrance in transplants, so theres a strong chance (between 30 and 50%) that my body will wreck a new kidney and I'll be back in renal failure in a couple of years at best, so she could just be wasting her kidney on me. Secondly, it's a really invasive procedure with a long recovery time, and I know she wants to go travelling and explore the world, and I don't want to be the thing that holds her back from that. \n\n  A couple of my friends and family don't see things from my side and think I'm either being too stubborn to accept help, or too pessimistic about my outlook if I do get a transplant, and think I should let my friend get tested.

When I decided to switch universities last year and move back in with my parents I was giving up a very well paying, stable job as an au pair/tutor. I hadn’t lived at home for about 4 years and in that time my mother and father made the decision to start fostering a 13 year old I will call Alice. I love Alice, I never had a girly kinda sister around since I had a very manly lesbian sister and my twin brother. She’s hard working, sweet and caring, and none of this is directed towards her. \nTo make up for me not having a stable income anymore my parents decided to hire me as an au pair to Alice. \nMy hours are essentially 07:00-07:30 Monday till Friday, 14:00-16:00 Monday till Thursday and 14:00-20:00 on a Friday (She has choir in a town 40 minutes away and we get home late every Friday). This in between studying full time, and working another side job. \nThey pay me R3400 a month (about $244) which is supposed to include my fuel. I drive about 22km (about 14 miles) every day dropping and fetching her from school. Au Pairs in my country generally charge R50-75 an hour ($3.50-7.50) and R3/km ($0.20). \n\nNow that all of that is over let me start from about 15 minutes ago when I told my parents that I wanted to stay at my boyfriends house this weekend, starting on Thursday as I currently have off from school and he is house sitting this entire weekend, so he has no way of visiting me. My mother freaked saying that who would look after Alice on Friday, as she is also on break and therefor doesn’t have school on Friday either. I stood there flabbergasted as my mom berated me about how if I was her client back in the old town I would not treat her like this and that I should look after Alice this Friday. I walked out of the room absolutely furious that she would speak to me like that. If she wanted me to look after Alice she could have asked nicely and I would have said yes and gone through to my boyfriend Friday afternoon instead. \n\nShe brought in business a o I decided to handle this as cleanly and business-like as possible. After some serious calculations I figured out that my parents were not only underpaying me (R35 an hour/$2.50) but also grossly misusing me. So I’ve decided to propose I charge them what they should be paying me, including overtime for looking after my sister this entire week. Since I only work from 14:00, that would include an extra 6 hours of work everyday that they need to pay me for, and I would discuss a new monthly rate that I should be rightfully paid. I am separating business from family and if they want to look for a cheaper option they can try but they will not find it, as I would be charging them the bottom rate for an au pair here. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for doing this to my parents? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "input": "**The backstory.**\n\nI am dealing with an ex-wife of 10 years who has a history of mental illness/issues. I have also proven on several occasions that she has lied on a variety of things. She will say that her car has broken down so she can't take our child to school, only for it to work so she can go to a job interview later that day (with my child). She has told me that one of our friends was in a car accident and that I needed to watch our child so that she could visit her; only to see that friend post on Facebook 30 minutes later. She has told the government that I left both her and my child (it was a mutual separation) so that she would be bumped up on the list to get government assistance. She has also admitted to lying about some serious allegations about other ex-husbands because she was mad at them. So overall, everything she says I have to take with a grain of salt.\n\nNow, roughly a few weeks ago, I suggested keeping him on some of her days until she gets her life a bit more adjusted. This would have reduced her from 14 days to 6 days a month (every other weekend). Her response was to threaten to take me to court. She wasn't going to let me boss her around anymore and she will ensure that she has a relationship with her kid (which implied I was trying to prevent that). I actually 100% want them to have a relationship, which is why I follow the visitation schedule rigorously.\n\nOn top of that, I am engaged to someone who really doesn't like her continuous involvement in our lives. We are completely independent from my ex and almost never rely on her for any assistance; yet every month or so we are approached to accommodate her for whatever reason that I'm never sure is true. In a lot of cases, we end up accommodating; but I am trying to stop that because it's very fair to say that my ex shouldn't have so much direct involvement in our lives - especially if she is lying to us.\n\nOur visitation setup is that while I actually have primary custody, we personally have a 50/50 setup right now. When I consulted a divorce lawyer roughly two years ago, he told me that because this 50/50 setup has been the norm for years, she could take me to court, accuse me of being unfair and the judge could side with her. I have since started capturing documentation incase I ever do go back to court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation**.\n\nToday I got a text from my ex saying her drinking problem is getting out of hand and she wants me to take him for a week while she attends AA to get her problem handled. He is supposed to visit her tonight and has made no reference to her drinking problems until this morning.\n\nHer text implied she has not started it yet, despite having all week to do so. She has had the past three days and will have the next three days free to attend. I also believe AA is not a one-week-and-done situation and is an ongoing process, meaning she will need to schedule her meetings on nights where she does not have our child, anyways.\n\nHer family has expressed to me that they do think she has a drinking problem, but because of her history of lying, I'm not convinced that today's claim is legit and is actually being used as a reason to get out of parenting tonight.\n\nTo add to this, my fiance's father is an alcoholic. So if this turns out to be a false claim, that is *really* going to rub her the wrong way. All things considered, I've found it best to err on the side of being skeptical.\n\nSo, hopefully I've been able to articulate that this is a complex situation. I don't want to dismiss a potential serious claim; but I also don't want to enable more lying using serious claims like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will I be the asshole?**\n\nI am planning on telling her that this is a serious issue that will take longer than a week. Therefore, I suggest she keep seeing him and maintaining their relationship while visiting AA on her off-nights and keeping her drinking in-check on her nights with my child. Otherwise, I will be willing to go back to my proposed visitation schedule from a few weeks ago from here on out and not just for a few weeks. ",

Because relationships with your ex can be terrible! He still has a crush on her, since he has every class with her and sits right next to her. Imagine seeing someone you were so close to having a relationship with dating someone else, or just being stuck in a friend zone with someone you love..\n\nSo Reddit WIBTA for suggesting my friend that it might be better for him to stop being friends with his ex? I might just be acting over protective, but I just want him to be happy!",

She is a bit self centered and is a massive FOMO (Fear of missing out) most of the time she will try to do everything with you or try to get everyone to do the same thing. I have one kid and he tends to get a bit annoyed about this because he likes to be polite but he also likes to do his own thing so he doesn't really enjoy when my sister tries to do everything we do. My sister also has two kids, which means whenever her kids want to do something my sister tries to get everyone to do the same thing. My son recently confessed to me that his starting to reach his breaking point, and wants to have to have the next 1-2 years of our holidays to ourselves and his and our friends.  \n\nThis has been going on for about 3-2 years and is starting to seep into other holidays we do as well. She also tends to stay for almost the entire time where down there so that just adds fuel to the fire. We really just want to  holiday without her for a year or two. This whole situation also stops us from inviting my son's and our friends, due to lack of space and everything we mentioned. It's really hard for us to say stop, since she is family but this hole situation is getting really hard and annoying. So will we be the assholes for telling her to stop.",

My brother's team starts to behind in goals, and the opponents and their coach seem to think this is a great opportunity to be crazily disrespectful, making dirty fouls, clapping loudly whenever our team misses a pass, insulting the crowd and making fun of my little brother's team (\"hey let's try and get that 10 goal lead\"). Things are clearly heating up, and I'm slowly getting mad and excited, even though I still remain quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game ends, my mom and I are heading out, while my father waits inside gymnasium for my brother. The enemy team's players come out: they're loud, obnoxious, and complaining about a lack of fair-play from our team. I'm out of the car, while my mom's sitting in it. I overhear them trashtalk my club one too many times, and it makes my blood boil. I open the car's door and tell my mom I'm going to see them. I call the other team's coach, and tell him that I reckon he's being pretty arrogant for a coach that didn't see his team win a single game the year prior, and lose every week-end by 40 to 10. By the time I end my sentence, my mom has jumped out of the car, stepped in and is insulting the coach. I know she's short-tempered and really hot-headed, so I'm considering holding her back ; but the coach is already getting inside his car. I turn around and start walking towards our car, certain my mom is right behind me, but after a few steps I hear them both still arguing. When I look back, my mom has opened the coach's car, and she's almost stepped in yelling at his face. I'm pretty paralysed at this point, still very stirred up. I don't move until a few seconds later, when my mom finally comes back to the car, sits in and lets out a sigh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know what I did probably wasn't the right nor best thing to do, but I just felt like this time I wouldn't let it go ; but I also realise that was she did was very wrong, and that the guy could've hit her. She then asks me that I don't tell my father, as he'd be really angry at her for what she did, because it could've turned out real bad for her. But I also don't want her to do that again, when noone else will be by her side to help her if it turns bitter. This has been getting on my nerves, and I cant get it out of my mind\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my mom and I got into an argument with some guy, but she crossed the line and kept going at him when him and I had backed down; she doesn't want me to tell my dad.

She is literally the only reason I would still visit the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently the little old lady had a heart attack. She's had her surgery and is in recovery.

Not lying I legit have tests for autism coming up and am trying to get an appointment for possible skin cancer tests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she sounded extremely desperate. Said she would let me come in whenever I wanted, that it was only temporary, that things were royally fucked and they NEEDED some serious help. I agreed to come in and talk about it tomorrow. I have to admit I REALLY don't want to do this, but I do still like the other owner and I know he would greatly appreciate it. I also know it would make little old lady's recovery less stressful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo things are very concerning to me. One is that she would not discuss why things were so fucked beyond reason and Two is she would not discuss how I would be paid or how much. If they are I am going to insist it's in writing or I walk. I know that's probably an asshole move, but not why I'm writing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the thing that I feel like makes me an asshole. I want to limit this temporary work if anything.

Grandparents dead, no contact with any other family members. Me, my two brothers, and her are the extent of the family.\n\nSo let me start this off by saying that my mother is dying. She has probably a month to live, and that's being hopeful. I'm not going to bother going into the details, and if I'm being quite honest, I'm not 100% sure of all of them. Apparently it's common for patients with it to have heart attacks or strokes, and after she had one stroke she asked that if she had another one to not help her and let her go. I'm not certain if the hospital is allowed to do that, but that was her request (the reason I'm not sure of all the details is because I'm not at the hospital with her. My older brother stays with her, and me and my other brother try to make it to any important news sharing from the doctor. \n\nWhen we were younger, my mother always said she wanted to see all of us settle down and start a family with someone we loved, so we could have what she never got to. Both of my older brothers succeeded and made her happy with that, but I have not. However, I have been in an extremely casual relationship for the past year. I'm talking basically a FWB type thing but slightly more serious. We've gone out on dates with other people in that time with no jealousy, but if either of us ever wanted to maybe make things more serious, we'd be open to the possibility of it. I've brought her home to holidays and such at home, but my mom is aware of how casual we are. \n\nSo with my mother's wish she always expressed when we were younger, and the current... situation, I've been considering telling my mom that my \"girlfriend\" and I are engaged, so that she can die at least thinking I'm on my way to creating the life she always wanted for me. When I told my brothers my idea, they had different responses. The oldest said I was an asshole for even considering manipulating our mother, but the other understands where I'm coming from and would be okay with me doing it, even if he wouldn't do it if he was in my situation. I also talked to my \"girlfriend\" and she said she would do it if I thought it was for the best. I'm just worried that if I do my oldest brother will think I'm an asshole and resent me for it, and honestly I'm not too sure if it's the best idea myself.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

He recently informed the family that he has a girlfriend in the Philippines he met through an online dating site that he video chats with. We all think it is very weird and we are pretty uncomfortable with it. We know American men who have lived in the Philippines who said tons of women their desperately want an American husband so they can live in the US, so we strongly believe that's what's going on here. At first we were discussing how it was weird but ultimately harmless because he has little money so would never be able to fly her across the world. (He works part time minimum wage and that barely covers living expenses). This is assuming she can't afford her own ticket. But then we noticed that they are Facebook official and both posting lots of cringy stuff on facebook, and he recently changed his profile pic to include a screenshot of her. So still I think ultimately probably harmless but pretty embarrassing. My mom wants me to talk to him about it and tell him what the men we know who have lived in the Philippines have said. Basically she (along with others in the family) wants him talked out of the whole thing but thinks it's better if it comes from a sibling. I am one of two siblings who is in a position to talk to him in person, and the other sibling refuses. Letting him know when he is making a big social misstep is something I gave often done, and I think this qualifies, but it also seems to make him happy.

Our \"side by side\" last two hours\" and nearing the end of the time I realized he might be hitting on me a bit with the laughing, general comments, and him trying to get me to join a singles group in our area, so I dropped a comment as casually as I could about moving here and getting a place with my boyfriend, to avoid embarrassment on both parts.

I wouldn't be hurt by him not talking to me, but i found it odd him staring at me and brushed it off at first as maybe a crush, a few weeks later, I mentioned something to my cube mate, and he mentioned that he'd noticed Greg staring at me.

My boyfriend of about 5 months graduated last May with his BA in history. He's currently working a sales job that he mostly likes, but doesn't love.\n\nThat out of the way, here's the situation. Boyfriend loves history, and intends to go to grad school soon with the intention of getting a PhD in history and becoming a professor. Thing is, the job situation for history professors is [atrociously terrible]. I know everyone in the humanities (or the arts, for that matter) thinks they can beat the odds, but I don't think he understands how bad the odds are. I also think he doesn't understand what grad school is actually like, and he's expressed a very rose-tinted view of being a professor (he called it \"a six-figure job where you get summers off\", which is inconsistent both with actual salary data and with my personal experience).  This is something he's really passionate about, but I think he's setting himself up for a lot disappointment and heartbreak.\n\nI know that, as his girlfriend, I should be supportive. We aren't financially tied, so it doesn't hurt me financially if he goes into debt. Even though I love him a lot, I know that realistically its unlikely we'll be together by the time he finishes he finishes his degree (things change, people move, etc). I just see what dismal prospects lie down this path, and I don't want that for him.\n\nThere's also the issue that as a history major myself, I also wanted to be a professor before my parents convinced me against it and diverted me to a (hopefully) more realistic career path. It's not something I want anymore, other than in the sense of, \"in a perfect world...\", but I feel like if the topic comes up I have to lie and say that I was never interested in to job, or I have to a hypocrite and say that I want something for him that I don't think is a good idea for me. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I expressed my concerns for him, or should I just keep my mouth shut?",

            "input": "So, there are numerous nuances to this question. \n\nEvery time we hang out, they're drinking. It's like they can't go out without having liquor. I don't drink, so I don't understand the near-constant need to drink. \n\nWhenever we go out around someone's birthday, it ends up as \"We're paying for X's dinner, because it's their birthday.\" Well, this burns me for a few reasons. First is that my friends make a LOT more money than me, but secondly, they always pick something expensive, where I can barely afford food for me, much less an appetizer, drinks, and an entree for the birthday person. Third, it's always something I won't eat. 95% of the time, it's Asian. I'm limited on what I will eat because it will give me bathroom problems if it has too many spices. I'm limited to white rice and a bland meat, with salt and pepper. I do eat other things, and regret it later. An example of this was a friend chose Asian seafood for her birthday. I checked out the (expensive) menu and found one thing I could eat safely, teriyaki chicken and white rice. Birthday girl chose a family-style meal which started at $100, and contained literally NOTHING I could have. So I would've been paying upward of $40 after food, drinks, and tip for food I can't have. \n\nAnother thing is that we have different schedules. I work nights and they all have regular 9-to-5 jobs. When asked when were available to hang out, I'll give them a time, it's agreed on... then changed so I can't make it. This time, I suggested breakfast, because they I can go home to sleep, which THEY AGREED TO, then just today, they've changed it to a liquid lunch and karaoke and then a hard lunch, probably on an Asian place, based on the neighborhood. \n\nI feel like an asshole, mainly because they tell me I am. They tell me I don't try (which is bullshit, I think, as I try many cuisines because I like to eat, and I want to know what I CAN'T eat), but it seems like they're outvoting me as a group to do what the majority wants. Which isn't a problem, I just don't understand why they ask when everyone can make it, then change it so I'm the ONLY person who can't make it. \n\nI made it a New Year's resolution to try to see my friends more, but this situation made me realize exactly WHY I don't like to see them. They always make me feel excluded, mainly because I can't afford to do the things they do (they all just had a spa day together that I found out about via whatsapp), and say \"That's okay, you don't have to come.\" \n\nI feel like, with the spa day, and everything else, just stop inviting me. Hell, I've been trying to extricate myself from these people for years, and it always comes down to \"/U/notastepfordwife, you're not trying, you're kinda selfish, but we love you.\" I feel like, if I'm the asshole, they wouldn't want to be around me, either, right? But they want to hang out, and I keep doubting myself. I know I'm an asshole in some respects, but is this one on me? Am I just not doing all I can to be a good friend?\n\nHelp me out, here. If I'm the asshole, I want to be better than that. But if I'm not, I gotta figure out how to tell them that I AM trying, but I'm not feeling included.",

For the most part everything is good, she's a very kind and loving person, and in most aspects I'm happy with the relationship. However, there are a few issues, the most prominent of which is the fact that we haven't had sex in the five months that we've been together (Or the month or two that we had been dating.) \n\nWe've gotten close once towards the beginning of the relationship. Sparing the details, during foreplay she told a joke that we both laughed at for a while, and as the laughter died down she mentioned that it killed her mood, and we could pick up where we left off another time. So, we stopped. It was no big deal, sometimes you're just not in the mood. \n\nAfterwards though any time she started to flirt with me heavily and I would respond in kind, she would respond with something along the lines of 'Hard pass' or 'Down boy,' because 'she's just teasing.' Being rejected so frequently and exclusively is doing a number on my self esteem, and the constant teasing is leaving me pretty frustrated. Strangely, she's frequently mentioned how 'healthy' our sex life is to our mutual friends.\n\nNow, I'm someone who has a high sex drive when I'm in a relationship, and I really need physical intimacy. A decent part of a relationship to me is the feeling of being wanted, and expressing your want for your partner.  I've tried talking to her about it a few times trying to figure out her reason for never wanting to get intimate in case it's something that we can work on, but she has yet to give me a reason beyond just 'not being in the mood.'\n\nConsidering everything else in the relationship is very good I feel like it would be extremely shallow of me to break up with her over sex. But, it's a serious source of stress in my life at the moment. With her either unsure of the problem, or unwilling to talk to me about what the problem is, I don't see it getting any better.\n\nWIBTA?",

This program takes place in an apartment complex in which we each get one roommate (2 people per apartment, 6 people in total). We've been dealing with drama regarding a \"client\" here for weeks. He's been making romantic advances on my roommate (including touching her ass), has called me hurtful names, and treats his roommate and everyone else horribly. We'll call him Mike (not his real name for privacy). \n\nWe recently found out that Mike is being discharged from the program--much to our (me, my roommate's, and two of our guy friends') relief. He initially lied to his roommate (one of the guy friends) saying he was getting discharged from his primary care. However, Mike's case manager wishes to fight the discharge--not that the staff of the program will agree to it as they are tired of Mike's bullshit. \n\nDue to the mounting drama, her depression, and people spreading rumors  (Mike, and a few others most likely), my roommate cut herself for (presumably) the very first time. I didn't see the cutting happen, but my roommate showed me the cut on her arm that she had made and was on the phone with the local Crisis team. I'm very close with her to the point where we're like sisters, and I'm very concerned for her. She's opened up to me in the past, and told me she has made a few suicide attempts, and that she has depression. I'm basing my suggestion on the rule (?)  that \"if a friend tells you a 'secret' that is potentially dangerous to their health, tell an authority figure\". In our case the \"authority figure\" would be staff. \n\nI want to tell the staff about this incident, but I also don't want to butt my head into business I should not be involved in (even though Mike has done hurtful things towards me as well but I have already informed the staff of that).

(I broke a rule so I fixed it and am reposting) \n\nMy aunt breeds Australian Shepherds.

She does it as a side business and it helps pay for stuff around the farm and house that they wouldn't be able to afford to get fixed otherwise. She's also just an amazing hardworking woman. When I was nine/ten, she gave me (not sure if my parents paid or not- never asked) my first dog, who was my rock through various issues that come with a rough childhood. I was a kid and made mistakes, but I truly loved this dog and cared for her as best I could. She had to be put down about a year ago now due to age related health issues, and lived to the ripe old age of fifteen.\n\nMy BF and I are getting ready to move into a townhouse, and we'll be looking for an ESA for me for anxiety and depression issues, and as such I'm trying to get a dog that's under a year to make it easier with training. Here's where the issue comes in. I desperately want an Aussie again. The place we're going to has the backyard opening up into a park, and I'm working to keep to a strict schedule that would work with the high energy of an Aussie. Part of me fully believes in the \"adopt don't shop\" mindset, but the other part of me wants an Aussie again. I had thought of adopting from an Australian Shepherd rescue, but now I can't imagine telling this woman that gave me my first dog that I chose to get my next one from somewhere else. And honestly, with her skill in picking personalities of even puppies, I feel like she would be best for getting me a good match.\n\nThe compromise I came to was that once we're settled in and I've been able to faithfully stick to a schedule that would suit a high energy dog, I would go with whatever came up first- either she had a spare puppy that didn't get bought or a rescue Aussie that matched my needs came up. But in the end, if the rescue comes up first, AITA for getting a rescue instead of asking to buy a puppy from my aunt? I know she would save me a puppy from the next litter if I asked.",

I only smoke outside, with the door shut -even before daughter- and he smokes in his apartment. I suspect he typically doesnt smoke in his apartment for the few hours that she is with him because she has never smelled like smoke before, even to my nonsmoker mom. So that leads me to believe he smoked inside this last visit.\n\nI 100% do not believe I have any right to ask him not to stop smoking completely in his own apartment. The only exception being when DD is there. We all know cigarettes are toxic AF (and I really shouldnt be smoking at all), especially for developing children. My stance is that its lazy and selfish as hell not to go outside. I did not say that to him, nor insinuate it.\n\nI explained that shed never smelled like smoke before and for DD's health, please dont smoke inside while shes with him. I dont want her developing breathing issues because of his (and my) choices. She does not have a choice so we shouldn't be making choices for her that harm her. \n\nHis response : he smoked a lot the night before but didnt while she was there and didnt really say either way if hed be sure to go outside to smoke while DD is there.\n\nI didnt say this to him, but I dont really believe him. Hes smoked a lot the night before (evidence on the table) I've dropped her off with a different outcome.\n\nSo here's the actual WIBTA question. He has not made any effort to get his car fixed (hed much rather be chauffeured around) and I usually take DD for visits, with my mom doing pickup if I have to work and ex's parents occassionally helping. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped driving her over there if DD continues to come home smelling like smoke? If he makes other arrangements for p/u and d/o, I likely wouldn't keep her from him, but its doubtful hed do that.\n\n\nWe do not have an official custody in place, so he gets her when he can, but usually *only* when its convenient (which sometimes leads to weeks between visits, it's gotten a little better though). He pays a small amount in child support, usually late. Other than that and the short visits, doesnt do anything to contribute to DD's care. He makes very few sacrifices for DD (I'd say none, with the exception of small CS), the least he can do is take it outside when shes with him for a couple of hours.  I drive her to support the father daughter relationship, but don't want to if hes going to smoke inside. \n\n\nTL;DR : cigarettes are bad and dad wants to smoke inside for the few hours he has our &lt;1 year old.

Bear with me, this might get long but I'll try to only post the facts. \n\nAbout a year ago a girl I knew in high school (almost 15 years ago) friended me on Facebook. We only kind of knew each other through a school club but I figured sure, I'll add her. She started messaging me occasionally and it was nice to catch up, but I still consider us more of acquaintances than real friends.\n\nThis girl has a lot of drama. Her husband has lupus, she's got a myriad of medical issues (supposedly), she's constantly in-between jobs. At one point last year, shortly after I friended her on social media, she was doing a fund-raiser for something medical for her husband. Since I allot about $200 a month for charitable giving, I sent it to her, anonymously. I figured I could give money to someone in need that month instead of my usual organizations and yay, good karma and all that. (I also pointed her in the direction of state and government assistance programs, but IDK if she ever looked at them.)\n\nBut somehow she found out it was me. Since then, once or twice a month, she's asking me for money. Her furnace broke. She needs money to buy wood for their fireplace. She is in debilitating pain and her insurance doesn't cover the bills. She just needs $35 to cover food for the week or she won't be able to eat. Her car broke down. They sold their house in Texas and moved to Wyoming (who *does* that?) and the new house has more problems than they realized. You get the idea. At one point she even asked for like $2500 in startup capital for a bakery she plans to open...\n\nShe always promises she'll pay me back. I'm not that stupid. But since I already plan to spend $200 each month helping others, at first I figured it wasn't a big deal. Lately, however, I'm starting to think that it's just enabling her. The last time she asked for money I told her that $50 was all I could give her and that I can't be her ATM or bank, because even little amounts add up and I have my own family and kids to take care of. I told her I'm seriously done after this, that I wished her the best but I'm tapped out financially and emotionally and I'm just done.\n\nWell, guess who just got a message. She only needs $80 this time because she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and her husband is keeping her up because he's in pain and his disability check hasn't come in... I'm just so over it.

Both of his parents passed in that house, and he would like to go the same way.  Normally, there would be no problem with this.  There are home heath aids for a reason, and I dont mind taking food over to him semi-regularly.  However, his home I recently learned, is not fit for human habitation. \n\nNo, you're thinking, but OP if he's been a family friend since before you were born how were you never in his house before? Well, because cats and I like breathing. But seriously, he never hosted gatherings and when extra folding chairs or the like were needed he would go over and get them and bring them back. He's a super private person and has always been well groomed and presentable.\n\nHis health took a turn for the for the worse about a year and a half ago when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Chemo weakend him but he kept going. ~5 mo ago he got the news that it spread all through his body in the form of bone (and I think lymph node) cancer.  Stage 4. He doesn't have much medical background and doesn't want to know, but I don't think he has more than a month or three left. He can barely hold a conversation much less go upstairs to his bedroom without being out of breath.  He'll fight to the end. \n\nHerein lies the problem: I always knew he had a lot of stuff, he would talk about it but I didn't realize how bad it was. I found out how bad when I dropped of food and he couldn't get up out of bed to put it away himself. The kitchen sink doesn't drain, there was a water leak in the upstairs bath and now there is two inches of mold hanging from the downstairs bathroom ceiling, the bathroom likely hasn't been cleaned in years with shit all over the toilet. He doesn't take the garbage out and there's even mold on the egg shells. I ended up nauseous and bordering on an asthma attack after being in there for 2min. There are paths to get through the rooms but they are narrow - I'm sure a fire marshal would have a fit. I'm concerned about his basic hygiene at this point. When I saw all this it was 6:30pm and he admitted he hadn't been out of bed or eaten yet that day.\n\nWere he not dying, I wouldn't hesitate to call the county and get him help for the hoarding.  But since he is, which is more important: his mental health or what physical health he has left? A week in the hospital in December yeilded anxiety attacks from being separated from his stuff.  So, would I be the asshole for calling and getting him sent to a county home for the short remainder of his life? Or do I leave him to die in peace in his filth?",

I work as one of the IT managers for CompanyName in Mexico. 90% of my job requires of me to be in constant communication with our US office, therefore I am fully bilingual, and have a barely noticeable accent. As such, one of my co-workers, whom I didn't really speak with before, asked me to teach her English, so she could improve her own skills set. Apparently, she walked by my office one morning while I was on the phone, and I had left my door open. (irrelevant, but I have been an ESL teacher before)\n\nI agreed to do so, and our first class was to be on a Monday, 1 hour before my shift started. The night before, I spent a good hour and a half preparing a class for her. My daily commute is 2 hours to work, 2 hours back, so being at the office 1 hour earlier was a bit rough, but I am all for people wanting to better themselves, so I didn't mind it. Except she didn't show up. No call, no show.\n\nWhen she finally messaged me throughout the day, she apologized for oversleeping, and re-scheduled me for the next day, at the same time. She showed up 40 minutes late. The next two days she didn't schedule anything with me, and on the last day of the week, she finally showed up on time. This pattern has repeated as a mixed bag for about 7 months. I've gotten to the point of just not showing up whenever I think she won't show up either, and whenever I misjudge it, and she shows up but I don't, I apologize for oversleeping and carry on. I guess it is important to note I am not charging her for it. She stopped scheduling me all together about 4 months ago, but we've kept in touch and I guess we've become office friends. I try not to message her much while at work, or on our personal time. Every other week I'll send her a meme or a bad dad joke I found, but that's about it. She replies in kind. She's confided in me a few of her personal issues, and even made a few passes at me, all of which I blew off and ignored, since I know she has a boyfriend. A couple of months ago, she called me to vent after her breakup.\n\nLast week, she asked me again to help her with her English, and I agreed, but told her that if she was not constant and dedicated to it, there would be no way to improve or learn. She said she was 100% on board with that, and she wanted to start as soon as possible, but she didn't want to do it at the office anymore. She said she'd rather do it over the weekend at some Starbucks or w/e. She said that Sunday (today) would work for her, and we settled on that.\n\nYesterday, at around 1pm I asked her to confirm if we were still on for Sunday. She didn't reply, and I assumed Sunday was off, so I stayed up with my friends all nightp playing videogames. Today, at around 11am, she replied. It started off with her apologizing for not replying to me, then confirming the time and place for today. By noon when I finally got up, I replied, and told her I'd see her then. I asked if she wanted to grab a bite after, and she didn't reply, though the message was read.\n\nAbout 1 hour before we were to meet, she calls me, and cancels on me. Apparently she had JUST rolled her ankle and was on her way to the ER because she \"couldn't even see straight\". I offered to catch up with her at the ER, and she declined.\n\nWIBTA if I just made our relationship as \"coworkers\" only? That is to say, no contact unless it is work related? I feel she is now trying to use me to get her ex jealous or some other shitty deal I want no part of, on top of me being sick of investing time into helping her, when she very clearly has no interest. I don't understand why she'd ask me for help, schedule me, even assist a few classes, and continue to spontaneously cancel. Am I being petty?",

We've had over a month to work on this and had met early in the month to discuss how to get it done, since this isn't something to get done in day or two. However, all three of us are super slammed. For example, I'm in 5 graduate level classes and actively interviewing at a company across the country (read I had a trip in the middle of this) and the other two work full-time and attend full time (3 graduate level classes). So all three of us just kept pushing off this project.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I got back from my job interview trip, I tried to rally the troop's because now we only have 4 days left. One person sends a bunch of potential references (which has been very helpful) and the other has put some notes to consolidate potential ideas. This morning I sent out an e-mail saying effectively, \"Hey guys, we have two days, we have 13-18 pages to write. I've broken it down into sections, here's your sections, let's start getting going on it.\"    \n\n\nI split the work out to me- 60%, person 1- 30%, person 2 -10% based on how my gut tells me they'll actually get done. Since this morning, person 1 did reach out and say \"Ok, but I have another assignment due, so I'll work on it after.\" (Note:  I also have this assignment due and it should only take about 2 hours to complete...) That was now 8 hours ago and there's been no movement on their parts and this person is across the country, so their day is now pretty much shot. Person 2 has not responded since they put the references two days ago.   \n\n\nSo WITBA if I tell let my professor know that at this point, I've done the vast majority of the work for one and from what it seems that I will be the sole author of Part 2?

As I'm waiting, my next door neighbor, with whom I've never interacted before, came in to get her laundry from another dryer.

She said she couldn't hear it, and then apologized for any noise she makes while Twitch streaming, which I never hear anyways.\n\nI saw this as a conversational opportunity to find out what sort of games she streams and politely ask if she'd be willing to share her username, which she did. Sounds fine, right? Here's the thing, though: while she was picking up her clothes, she informed me that she had to clean all of her clothes, and in fact she was dressed in just a night gown. I think she may have found the situation uncomfortable and only told me her Twitch username out of politeness, but I kind of want to be a friendly neighbor and genuinely support her channel, especially since women tend to be harassed on Twitch.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.  This is mostly due to her sexual views which contrast mine.  She is much more open to sex but stays monogamous to me since I am less liberal about it.  She has made clear though that if we are separated, she still needs physical contact.  Which brings me to the incident...\n\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\n\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\n\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.  There's a chance we'll be separated again this summer and I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to give her the option of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up.  Maybe I'm looking for more general advice but I could only think of this sub.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did something id consider cheating.  Wondering if I'd be an asshole to give her an ultimatum of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up",

We're still not due to move until the summer, but they moved in back in January. We agreed to let them, and only charged rent -- no utilities since we have decent jobs, trying to be nice,\n\nThroughout their staying here (at the time of this writing it's been a little over two months), one came to us asking if she could get a dog. We own three dogs ourselves, so we really didn't see the harm. My wife and I have 3 medium-sized dogs so it was surprising when she got a very large Husky.\n\nThis dog is huge. The door to her room is now scratched all-to-pieces where the dog wants to be out. The dog also destroyed the backyard and the screen on our back window. I will admit that some of it was probably from my dogs as well. They're not entirely innocent.\n\nMy other friend felt as if she was incredibly lonely. Not having a pet, she requested if she could get an animal. She wanted a cat and we declined because my wife is allergic to cats. After a while of discussion she ended up talking us into it. Honestly, my wife and I are pushovers.\n\nI work from home. Saying that, I'm home a huge portion of the day. Our friends are at college or just out hanging out with their other friends until 11:30-12. So, everyday we sit at home all day having to hear the cat's cry all day nonstop. Neither of us can show it attention seeing as how she's allergic and I would have to scrub down/change clothes anytime I came in contact with it.\n\nHusky friend has also had her boyfriend staying here for the entire month. He doesn't really do anything. He's just living here using up the utilities that my wife and I are paying for. Initially when it was brought to my attention that he was coming, it was for the weekend. I feel like this is slightly unfair to my wife and myself since we're having to spend even more money on utilities.\n\nMy wife and I are still the ones buying the toiletries, dish soap, laundry detergent, pretty much any consumable used in the house. They do buy their own food but I'm stuck doing their dishes and cleaning up after them in the kitchen. I can't say they dirty up the communal areas much. Their rooms are absolutely disgusting and  foul-odors are coming from them.\n\nTL;DR: My friends moved in, got a dog and a cat.

However, whenever I bring up conversation about things I'm interested in or currently working on at the moment (we're both artistic and love trying new medias) she kinda of gives half-assed responses. I get that talking about certain things with no shared interests can kinda be dull, but maybe I'm wrong in thinking she should at least try to sound anything but bored or annoyed? \n\n        Anyway, this isn't just some topics.

So I go to her for advice on girl stuff, or just life advice because she can be really keen on giving good advice. \n   \n  For the past few months though, when I go to her she again responds with an annoyed tone. She says 'I don't know' or 'Dont ask me' for everything. I get not knowing what to say but when it's said like I'm being an annoyance it pushes me away. \n\n She comes to me for advice too, which I'm fine with. I try to answer with my honest opinion and what I believe is the best advice from my POV. We're both seniors in highschool, adulthood is around the corner. The two of us have matured, however she acts very childish if the advice is not what she wants to hear. She proceeds to get annoyed and just end our conversation right then and there.  \n\n When she's talking about her projects and current happenings I try my best to actively listen and engage with her. But lately I'm not feeling it. If she can't return an small interest in my life hapenings then I just feel that I should distant myself from her, especially after we graduate. I feel like I am working for a good friendship with her while she couldn't care less if I was there or not. I feel like this relationship isn't worth pursuing anymore if it's not mutual. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way and thinking about cutting ties? \n\nTdlr: Friend of 5 years doesn't seem to put effort into our friendship anymore and it comes of that she's wants attention from me but not a mutual friendship. AITA for wanting to cut ties? \n\n\nEdit: So I brought it up and she kinda just tosses the subject to the side like normal. However, she seems to be treating me differently. While it's not all the time, she is listening more and generally being interested in what I conversate with her. She's not completely done with showing indifference and annoyance but I have noticed a difference, which is what I could ask for for a start. \n\n ",

It would put a financial burden on me, since I'm the breadwinner at home and pay most of our bills. This was also not discussed when we first talked about going or I would have said no. WIBTA for not taking that Friday off? She probably won't be able to go because now she's planning on riding with them and they leave Friday.",

            "input": "Allow me to explain. My sister is married with two kids but apparently she was talking to an ex of hers about a year ago. Well his girlfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out because they were talking about how she's not 100% happy in her marriage and how he was going to come through and see her while he was on his haul. He's a truck driver. Anyway she got into it with his girlfriend and I understand that she lives in a remote area but she could find better things to do with her time then stirring up drama with other people.\n\nShe's saying someone shared screenshots with her ex's girlfriend about stuff that she was saying. I told her to talk to me about something else that she had posted about on Facebook last night while I said that she could. Then she comments I would suspend I need to know that you're not the one that was sharing the screenshots with his girlfriend. I said first of all I would never do that and secondly it hurts me that you would think I would do that to you because you're family.\n\nWhat I really wanted to say to her was well maybe if you stop stirring up drama you wouldn't have these problems. If you know that a man is attached then leave him alone ex or not. Especially because he's an ex. I feel that she has nothing better to do but the spend her days engaged in bullshit and drama with other people. I can totally understand her ex's girlfriend being upset. \n\nBut yet she seems to think that she's not in the wrong here. First of all I feel like she is doing stuff behind her husband's back that she wouldn't want him knowing about it and secondly she's holding her ex's girlfriend responsible when in reality it's her fault. Also, I'm not too happy because it seems like she's not spending enough time worried about her kids and instead is worried about what everyone on Facebook is doing. Stop worrying about that Facebook drama and start spending more time with your kids.\n\nMy niece is four and I suspect that she may be autistic. It seems like not enough is being done to help her. I mean I don't know because she lives two hours away but from what I'm hearing from other family members and what she's posting on Facebook she's not addressing this like she should be. I'm just pissed off that she would even accuse me of doing something like that when this is her fault. Would I be the asshole if I told her that this whole thing is her fault and that she needs to stop talking to her ex especially when she's married and knows that he's with someone else?",

            "input": "I was never really a cat person.  I grew up with dogs and personally prefer them over cats.  I got my cat kind of through an ex.  She lives in a small city with a lot of stray cats and used to leave food outside for them, she knew their personalities and would name a few of them.  As I was leaving her place one night one of the cats approached me.  She got super excited because that one had always been super timid and stayed away from everyone.  But it started rubbing up against me, letting me pet her, letting me hold her, etc.  The ex basically talked me into taking the thing home with me, which I did because the cat had some kind of connection with me.\n\nThat week I brought her to the vet, got her shots, got her spayed, and got medicine for fleas and worms.  She was also very thin when I got her, so I made sure she had good food and occasionally wet food.  It's been over two years now and I am just completely apathetic to this animal.  Look I have been a good pet owner.  She goes to the vet regularly, I buy her toys and play with her, I even bought her a 6' tall cat perch thing that she likes a lot.  Her litterbox is always clean, she always has good food (never bought the super cheap stuff), and I make sure to spend time giving her attention.  But I just have no emotional connection to this animal.\n\nI've always been an animal lover too, people that abuse animals make me fucking sick and I still can't watch My Dog Skip.  But I'm also just tired of being tied to this animal.  I'm tired of sweeping cat litter, and getting rid of the odors, of cat hair and things getting knocked off tables.  I'm really just tired of taking care of an animal I feel nothing towards.  I honestly think if I had an animal that I actually loved, I wouldn't have a problem doing any of this.\n\nThere's also a part of me that thinks she would probably be better someplace where the owner actually loves her.  But I'm also pretty sure the cat has already bonded with me pretty closely, and she's still very timid around anyone else.  So I'm not sure if giving her up wouldn't even be best for the cat at this point.  I was going to give her up within a few months of getting her, but felt super guilty about it and decided not to.  So here I am again, questioning my judgement.",

            "input": "As far back as I can remember, my dad wasn't content if he didn't inflict pain on most things that were small, defenseless and weak. Specifically, my siblings and I. This is basically your typical abusive household where I couldn't even so much as bat an eye and before I knew it, I was a recipient to a backhand square to the face. I firmly believe that my father derived some sort of pleasure or satisfaction by making us and my mother feel inferior and truly undeserving of anything else good in this world. I wasn't exactly deprived but what I did have, was mostly provided by mother that made a living off of scamming people. As far as what she did to sustain us, that is a story for a different day. As time went on, he never actually improved and it got worse. My mom became a literal punching bag for him. My mom was never defiant and besides trying to stand up for herself from time to time, she was pretty docile, for the most part.  I've gathered from most of my uncles and aunts that being raised by my grandparents on my dads side was hard in every sense of the word. They each can recollect a time when they have been subjected to an indiscriminate amount of hatred. When my father would recall memories from his upbringing I would view this from a very empathetic point of view. My father would remember times during his upbringing where he sustained multiple beatings and punishment that felt truly unwarranted. I would like to make it a known fact that I too, have a child of my own. I have never laid a finger on her and as far as I am concerned, I am a firm believer that you can discipline your kids without the need for violence. I should have probably prefaced with this but I am a second generation Mexican-American and living under an abusive household in my culture, is pretty common.  Common in my eyes but not acceptable. I would be more than happy to reveal more details about how shitty it was to grow up in a home where walking on eggshells seemed less of a punishment than what actually took place where I grew up --DM me. Let's fast forward to 8 years later and I get the news that my father is getting deported to Mexico because he is being accused of sodomy, rape and countless other charges by a woman whom he had married after my mother. I have wondered for a while now if the charges against my father were actually true or if he had pissed off his wife to the point where she felt like the only way out was to press charges and get him arrested seemed like the only viable option. Either way, he is currently back in his native country and barely making ends meet. I feel like I need to address the nightmares where I dream of beating up my father and  it varies from dream to dream. In some dreams I beat him to a pulp with my fists  and in other dreams I am bludgeoning with a huge, blunt object to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. I do not wish to have these dreams but they come about, subconsciously. I have researched dream interpretation sites and all of them, for the most part, insist that hatred and resentment on this level, pretty much affirms what I have been feeling all this time. My father has lived in these states well over 20 years so he doesn't know much else. Since his recent deportation, he has had to assimilate and re-adjust to an environment he has not been a part of for a very long time. Because of this, I am receiving a lot of pressure from both my siblings and my relatives to provide for him in a way that would allow for his sustainability. I do not wish for advice. I have adopted a pretty firm stance that I will not provide any support. I have lingered on this topic for far too long. I have never been close to my father and at this interval, I don't care for it much anymore. Would I be so heartless as to say that I don't care whether he lived or died? I am pretty strategic, along with my partner about where most of finances go and cutting into what we currently have going on, would not allow for an additional expense, especially when dealing with another human being. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Roommate a is moving in with her boyfriend next year and roommate b has asked if me and my boyfriend would look into moving into a house with her. Sure thing I’d love a house with a yard for my pup. \n\n     So we start looking and it’s become apparent she wants to split rent three ways, but we’re looking at two bedroom two bath houses, maybe three bedroom depending on the amount of extra space we decide we need (but no one would be living in the third bedroom it’d be like an entertainment room with space for activities we all enjoy like yoga for roommate b, my boyfriends playstation, and maybe a painting station in that extra room for me). Anyways she wants to split rent three ways, so the lowest price for a two bdrm in my area is 1000 not including utilities. Instead of paying 500 each (500 from me and my bf and 500 from her before utilities) she wants me and my boyfriend to pay 667.00 a month for the same space she pays 333.00 for before utilities. \n\n      Now don’t get me wrong, I agree me and my boyfriend should pay more if we get the master, and I’m willing to pay 50-75 dollars more because we have the master and the bigger bathroom (however if that wasn’t enough for her I’d be fine with her having he master and my boyfriend and I could have the second bedroom). I just don’t feel like we should pay double her rent for that master. I also would of course want to split utilities where me and my boyfriend handle 2/3 and she handles 1/3 of the bill. And we’d even be willing to pay for the Netflix and Hulu subscriptions for the house because we do that already. \n\n       I explained this to her when we were looking at houses and she says she sees where I’m coming from but because it’s easier for me and my boyfriend to raise rent money it should be split 2/3 and 1/3. I understand there are two of us and maybe I’m just being stubborn but I really don’t think that warrants paying double her rent. My bf and I both work in the service industry and we bust our asses for the money we make. A one bedroom one bath or even two bedroom one bath for just me and my boyfriend run 750-900+ and I feel like I’d rather pay the extra hundred dollars and just have a space that’s completely our own.

Problems only started happening recently and mostly only because I have been thinking about breaking up. We never really had too much in common: we're both studying similar majors in uni (that's how I met her); we're from different backgrounds and cultures; and smaller insignificant things like she doesn't eat fruit at all and I love fruit, she doesn't exercise and I like to keep fit, she a chocolate connoisseur and I'm not a sweet tooth, different music and film tastes, etc. But we agreed that didn't matter too much since it didn't really affect how we felt towards each other.\n\nTo give some context, she used to be very into me and wanted to spent time together. Now it seems that only I'm initiating to make plans, meet up and talk, which we don't really do more than once a week. I understand a lot of this strain comes from uni now that the semester's commenced but I sort of feel forgotten and pretty dissatisfied in general that she's not really putting too much effort into the relationship. This feeling isn't based on any empirical evidence; she always tells me that she likes me and has always talked us out of it; but it is based on her attraction to me relative to the past.\n\nWe both agreed before uni began that we would see each other Friday evenings after class and occasionally have dinner out. First week was great spending time together, didn't have dinner. Second week was rough; I felt she was a little cold to me for some reason and I ended up trying to break things off again. She talked me out of it, I ended up reconsidering, opening up to her about how I felt and explained that she needed to improve her communication (not the first time she's told me and not the first time I've told her). We went out for dinner after. Now this is the third week. Last night (Thursday), she invited me to sleep over at her place (parents present) on Friday night. I said I was feeling under the weather and was probably better if I didn't. Come Friday I'm excited to finally spend some time with my gf after a busy week and she tells me that she's spending the evening with her sister. No notice, no apology for surprising me with her sudden plans (she did apologise for \"making me feel sad\" but that's not the point). I've been feeling disrespected like this for a while now.\n\nOf course this one event doesn't encapsulate the whole situation but I do feel like there's been this problem for a while now. I know she's feeling stressed in uni and that's probably what's taking the toll on her to justify her behaviour recently. I don't think it's due to any fault in her character but I feel like she doesn't understand me. I've tried to be honest to her about but it always feels like my words are falling on deaf ears. So I guess this is a bit of a cry for help: would I be an asshole if I were to end things like this now?",

The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. So would I be the asshole for telling them to take it down or even replace it? What if I got them a new flag?",

Once I applied, I told the managers that I could not work on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to me being in college. For the first few months, they’ve been good with not scheduling me on those days but it’s not until recently that they’ve started to screw me over. \n\nI decided to take more classes this semester so I can transfer quicker, but because of this I requested a third day off so I can focus on my education. I didn’t give a specific day of the week; I just needed more time to deal with a larger workload. Once I told them that they didn’t seem to happy about it. \n\nThe GM of the store rushed me to learn every position in the restaurant so I can close whatever role they needed that night. I’ve brought up several times that I need to have a third day off so I can focus on my education, and they’ve told me that they would fix the next schedule, and they never do. I feel like I ended up being the scape goat of the store, as in whenever someone can’t work a day, I’ll cover that position until they come back on the schedule. \n\nLast week was the major turning point, as the GM approved 5 vacations for spring break, leaving everyone to work just under 40 hours so they didn’t have to pay overtime and work ridiculous hours. For almost a month they’ve been having me work weird days, having my off days not work with my schedule but with theirs, and notifying me to clock in later that schedules so they can save hours once I walk in the restaurant. This is causing my grades to drop, my health to deteriorate, and my social life to completely disappear. \n\nI already requested a week off so I can have some time to unwind and destress because this job is literally killing me. At this point, I’m only working there cause I can’t find another job at the moment and I enjoy being around the other coworkers. I understand that they’re understaff and that several people have already quit, but that doesn’t justify the managers to completely abuse my availability because they know I need the money. \n\nTL;DR: managers are overworking me knowing I’m taking more classes, neglecting my requested time off and getting mad that I’m hitting overtime when they schedule me near 40+ hours a week",

There are lots of little issues with the place, but I mostly put up with them because there is really no other place for me to live in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue: Back in June 2018, the fridge that had been here when I moved in failed. I was gone for a few days before discovering this which meant I had a lot of hot, rotten food to clean out of the fridge and freezer. After I cleaned it, I called the landlord and asked him to either fix or replace the unit. He came by a few days later and did so, with a fridge that looked even older/busted up than the last. But I figured whatever, as long as it does the job. It sucked to be out of \\~$100 of food but I was just grateful to have the old, now stinky fridge out of my kitchen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil today, when the replacement fridge broke. Completely stopped cooling/freezing, and I tried trouble shooting it, making sure it was plugged in, the doors were shut etc. But nope, it was just broken. I feel like he just keeps replacing faulty appliances with faulty appliances (repairs/appliances are his responsibility as per the lease). Now I have lost about $200 worth of brand new groceries, and have rent coming up next week. I cannot afford to replace any of these groceries and pay rent. Would it be unheard of/completely make me an asshole to ask to help for food lost because of his bad appliances/have it come out of this month's rent? I did not even consider it the first time, but now I feel like I should ask because this seems to be a pattern and I'm worried that I'm just going to have more ruined groceries in 6 months-year.

C, even though he has his OWN apartment at the time, kept allowing E to sleep at our house. After about 3 days, I said I was uncomfortable to A (considering it was OUR place, not C’s) because:\n\nE always talks about fighting/hurting/killing people (including saying he wants to join the army solely to kill people)\n\nhe, a little over year ago (before we all moved in together) told a boyfriend of B’s that he “wanted to break into her apt and steal her underwear because it would be sexy” —and we don’t have locks on our doors here\n\nstole money and weed from C and weed from my boyfriend and me (yes, C knows about this) as well as has gone through C’s stuff in an obvious way while C let E stay with C\n\nHonestly the guy just makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable. The list goes on but I don’t have the available characters.\n\nSeveral months ago, A said “E is moving out of state, you’ll never see him again!” He moved back obviously or I wouldn’t be writing this post. Apparently, he has a great new roommate who doesn’t allow smoking weed in the house or noise after ten. good for him. However, that leads to him coming over several nights a week now. He stays the night which makes me uncomfortable. A has gone out of town for spring break, and E has not left our house since. It’s been four days now.  I don’t know how to approach this with C—especially because E would be here while I said “hey, we have talked about this.”\n\nI get that C pays rent here. However, he refused to sign the lease, which our landlords said needed to be done if he was to move in. I asked him for literally 3 months to do it and gave up.  I get he pays rent but he’s not even on our lease if something goes wrong, and before moving in knew about my discomfort.\n\nBasically, WIBTA if I told C that E needs to go? Debating if C needs to too. Thanks everyone.\n",

In 2018-2019!).\n\nAnyways, things have been going pretty well, and I'm happy to have made a new friend.  The only problem is, I can not STAND hearing him eat.  I'm very sensitive to \"mouth-noises,\" and the sound of someone opening their mouth while chewing is one of the most uncomfortable sounds I've ever experienced; it's like nails on a chalkboard times 10 for me.  It's not something I can think away either, it's an uncontrollable physical response to hearing someone open their mouth while chewing.\n\nNow I realize that this is MY problem, and I don't want to tell anyone how they should eat.  And I've also avoided the situation a few times by just not eating with him.  Except there have been many times when I'm hanging out with my other friend (his roommate), and he'll sit next to me on the couch and eat his dinner, and I'll be crawling out of my skin with how uncomfortable I am.  I even lean as far away as I can and nonchalantly cover my closest ear, and it's still not enough. He is honestly the loudest chewer I've ever met in my life.\n\nSo here's the question: WIBTA if I talked to him about it?  He has OCD and I have OCPD tendencies, and he and I have talked about our \"things,\" so I feel like bringing it up in that context might work? I realize that this is *my* issue, and I plan on framing it as such.  I just don't know what else to do; I can't just up and leave the room every time he's around me with food.\n\nThanks for any input, Reddit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It’s a 2 hour car drive from our city - which admittedly isn’t much, but my father is usually the one who drives and he always gets exhausted after these kind of trips - he’s quitting smoking and his body is aching all over, plus he’s not that young (55yo). \n\nAnyway, the event is on Saturday and my dad told my mom that he wants to go Friday night because he’d rather be well rested for the day of the event. My mother agreed - she’ll be there already, she goes tomorrow because she teaches in the University there - so my dad will be driving my sister and my two aunts (mother’s sister and mother’s aunt). Let’s call them Aunt 1 and Aunt 2. \n\nAnd here comes the problem... Aunt 1 (mom’s sister) wants to go Saturday - and around 11o’clock, despite my dad also saying that, if they had to go Saturday, he wanted to leave at 9 am at the latest. Mom still didn’t tell Aunt 1 that they’re actually going Friday night, and since mom travels tomorrow, she’ll likely not tell and leave the issue to my dad. Aunt 1 is struggling with depression (she was on antidepressives until last year, quit taking them for reasons we don’t know and only now resumed taking them) but she’s frankly been a nightmare lately. If anything doesn’t go her way she throws a tantrum and raises her voice and gets kinda mean. Because of that everyone’s afraid of telling her the “we’re going Friday” thing. \n\nI was keeping to myself - I’m not going, so I figured it’s none of my business. But now Aunt 1 is telling Aunt 2 that they’re going Saturday around 11am, which isn’t true at all since nobody told her that - she just assumed that, since that’s when she wants to go, that’s when they’ll go. I want to just tell her the truth already because it’s not fair to my dad, but I’m afraid that this isn’t my place. \n\nWibta if I didn’t wait for my mother and just told Aunt 1 that they are not going Saturday, much less at 11am?

For this reason, I think my mom resents me as the reason she was stuck with an abusive man.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad would abuse me and my mom would tell me it was my fault for not making a bigger effort to get along with him and obey him. I grew up thinking I was a bad person, because of this and because she was often irrationally cold and angry with me in a way she wasn’t to my siblings. When I was a teenager, I had some major health problems that made it hard for me to take care of myself. My mom was constantly angry and cruel to me during that 3 year period. I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone who raped me, and I couldn’t tell my mom about it because she was more interested in yelling at me for “having bad judgment” for dating this person. I moved out after being kicked out of the house temporarily. \n\nAfter I moved my dad turned some of his abuse on my younger brother, who I have always felt my mom favored over my sister and I. He threatened to kick my brother out of the house, so my mom left him. My dad made the divorce very difficult for her, going on a meth bender and losing his job (she had been a stay at home mom for years) so she would have to lose her house and alimony. My mom has understandably been a wreck since.\n\nI recently confronted my mom about the way she’s always treated me, since she asked if I was angry at her and I felt I owed her the truth. She told me that she felt trapped, that staying with her abuser was hard for her but she did it so we wouldn’t end up homeless, and that she always took his side because he would treat her worse if he thought she was undermining him in front of the kid (me). She said she was cruel to me for years because she was under a lot of stress - her brother committed suicide, her mom for Alzheimer’s and she had to fight her mom’s husband’s family over her care, and she lost her support system (she had previously homeschooled my siblings and I and now she didn’t so didn’t see the same moms). She said her hand was forced to leave my dad because he wanted to kick my brother out of the house, and she would’ve done the same if he tried to kick me out (she doesn’t remember that SHE kicked me out because she was on drugs at the time and is in denial). She says she just wants a closer relationship since I’m mentally ill and she’s worried about me.\n\nAITA for still being mad at her? I honestly feel she could’ve done more and is in denial about her real reasons for leaving. She claims to hate my dad but still keeps in contact with him despite him being a meth addict and trying to throw my sister off the side of the highway the last time any of us saw him. Even if she is being honest, I would rather have been homeless than lived with my dad. And this is petty, but I’m also mad that she’s sad about her brother. He molested me when I was young. She doesn’t know that but she does know that he was a convicted pedophile and was always alone with me so I can’t imagine she doesn’t suspect it. I still love her but I just don’t forgive her at all.",

            "input": "OK so please stay with me this is a very complex situation. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and together for over 8. For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). \n\nDuring this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent. After the sales job I worked for a restaurant start up for a year, then broke in to healthcare management, and now manage a clinic. I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). \n\nMy wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts. Now, when I say paid I mean technically they get a check but it is criminal what these theatre companies are able to get away with (we are talking like $200/week). I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen. I love my wife dearly and I know she loves me.\n\nThat said, I have always been the one that has to pay all of our bills. Rent, Internet, Phone, Electric I pay 100% every month and buy most of our groceries. I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....\n\nMy father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.\n\nBefore his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. \n\nI want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.\n\nSo I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?\n\nThank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.\n\ntl,dr\n\nI relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?",

            "input": "Hey guys,\n\nI'll explain this as succinctly as possible. 5 months ago, my mom invited the son of an old friend of hers to move in to our house. We (my sister and I) don't know the family well, so we thought it was odd. \n\nAs the days went on, we started to learn more about him. He's a sweet kid, but he definitely has his flaws. For one, he's a 17 year old high school dropout. Not great, but it happens (this is how I rationalized it to myself). He also smokes a ton of pot. While it isn't that big of a deal, we haven't been happy with the stench. His room is putrid. It smells like a mix between rotten food and pot. My mother seems to have no issue with any of this for whatever reason. \n\nAll of that doesn't seem \\*that\\* bad, right? I didn't think so either until my younger sister recently filled me in on some of the underpinnings of his life. She has the room adjacent to his. The wall that separates the room is extremely thin, so she hears everything. Here's what she told me: \"I can hear EVERYTHING, Dreadcarrier. The drop of a pin, a whisper. So guess what I get to hear when he has his boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week? A lot of fighting, crying, and sex.\" She's a college student (as am I) so this really disrupts her sleep/work schedule. Once again, my mother brushes this off. She thinks she's doing something nice for the kid and that takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, there's more! My little sister follows him on Instagram. He has been posting pictures of himself \"tripping\" on my back porch! Not to mention the fact that he took a picture of himself using my sister's expensive Yeti cup as a gravity bong. All of this has her truly irked, and my mom thought she was overreacting (to the cup thing, not sure if she knows about the psychedelics). \n\nAnyway, I've been skeptical of this arrangement from the get-go. I never thought it was a good idea to remove a problem child from his (accepting of his sexuality but strict about his lack of achievement) family. Once I saw it was giving him the freedom to do drugs and continue to let himself fall into a hole, my suspicions were confirmed. I haven't voiced my concerns because it isn't my house or my business, but now it is affecting my sister's life. \n\nI plan on confronting my mother. I want to explain that what she is doing may seem like a good deed, but it isn't helping the kid in the long-term. He has no life structure, no authority making sure he is doing right. He also has no intention of going back to school and smokes pot all the time. Giving him carte blanche isn't what's best for him. I also plan on explaining that his presence is disrupting her successful child's life. It isn't fair to give her the short end of the stick because she works hard. She deserves to live in a quiet house where she feels comfortable. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

First, she cheats off my papers without asking me even though I told her to do it herself and I’m clearly uncomfortable with this. I don’t really care if she cheats in general, but it really bothers me that she just takes my papers without asking. Then, she offers me advice about how I should add fluff to my college app even though I never asked her for advice.

I was also told the only reason I wasn’t fired right then and there was because of how understaffed we were. I also tried talking to other management and they said it was inappropriate to talk that way about my supervisor to them.\n\nThis left me feeling like I couldn’t trust anyone above me and after talking to fellow coworkers about the situation they said I should tell HR about it, but I also did some reflecting and decided I want to go back to my old job, which I can go back to anytime, I already cleared it with my old bosses, my coworkers said they would support me, and I realized that I was a lot happier, made better money, and had a lot more respect for my bosses at my old job, but I just want to make sure I am approaching this in a Just and legitimate way.",

She's been nothing but an amazing parent and she and my dad are perfect in every way, except one thing: my mum is a regular smoker.\n\nShe is a science teacher, she teaches about the dangers of smoking and what problems it can cause later in life, yet almost every day for the past 30 years she's been a smoker. I understand what I'm proposing is manipulative, and I wouldn't even consider it under normal circumstances:\n\n- Yesterday, my dad told me that my grandad was diagnosed with lung cancer, after being hospitalised for the past week because he has a stroke. My grandad has been a heavy smoker all his life.\n\n- A couple years ago my mum's mum was diagnosed with lung cancer, and now has 60% lung capacity because of surgery. She was and even now is still a heavy smoker.\n\n- A decade ago my mum's dad died of a heart attack. He'd previously has another heart attack AND had a major stroke. He was a smoker.\n\nI've seen what smoking does to people, and I don't want that for my mum. My nan had to carry an oxygen concentrator when she visited us because that was the only way she could be mobile, for god's sake. My mum even quit smoking with my nan after she was diagnosed, but about a year ago she started again..\n\nWhen I was walking with my dad about his dad's prognosis, he mentioned that my mum was probably going to die of a stroke. It all just hit me, that **she will die because of this.** My dad gave up smoking a couple of decades ago, and he was furious when my mum started again.\n\nI want to save my dad from having to live through a third family member having a stoke. I want to stop all this fucking pain because of a single fucking addiction. I love my parents so much and it kills me to see my mum killing herself with this habit...\n\nI'm seriously considering taking drastic measures. I'm going to plead with my mum to stop, but if she doesn't then I'll make her think I've taken it up. She's directly promised me never to become a smoker, but if she doesn't stop I don't think I have a choice.\n\nSo yeah. I just feel so helpless, and this is potentially my last ditch effort. Am I the Asshole here? What else can I do?\n\n**tl;dr**: 3/4 grandparents have suffered from smoking. My mum is a regular smoker and she's going to smoker her way to an early grave. None of my direct family want this. Is pretending to take it up a step too far?",

We're all on the same university course, were spending lots of time together, etc etc. Back in September, 3 weeks after we moved in, Katie organised my 21st birthday party. She really went to town. She bought a cake, a bottle of tequila, made a fun quiz about me for the party and came up with what my flatmates should get me. I had a great time! I have social insecurities and felt very loved. I was and still am grateful for all this effort she went to. A few weeks later, I signed a lease with her and 2 other girls to live with her next year.\n\nSince then, things have gone south. By November, it was clear that Katie and I weren't getting on. I felt like she often spoke down to me and made me out to be stupid, was snappy and generally rude to me. She also acts this way to my other flatmate Gemma. This behaviour was picked up by my other flatmates too. There have been a handful of fall-outs, I've reached out to her to make amends, asked if I've done anything wrong but all in all its been a fairly direct conflict-free relationship. \n\nI now actively dislike Katie. She complains all the time, makes a huge deal out of her problems, tries to one up me and Gemma, disagrees with us just to disagree...She has blamed me for things going wrong which have been nothing to do with me, bitched about me to my other flatmates, rolled my eyes at me when I've contributed to group work at uni...it's a hostile environment and I try my best not to rise to it. It's worsened my social anxieties and is a contributing factor to starting CBT a month ago.\n\nKatie's birthday is in 2 weeks and is having a dinner party style celebration in our flat. She's inviting our friendship group (we share most of our friends) and asking everyone to bring a dish. If this wasn't in my flat, I wouldn't go but really want to avoid sparking any drama. However, I'm torn as to whether to get her a present or even a card. I want to avoid making a statement by not getting her anything or stir up any drama, yet I don't really think she deserves anything from me. That said, I'm still grateful for the effort she put into my birthday. Gemma is getting her a card and present as they'd been best friends for a few years before this and I don't think Katie knows that Gamma doesn't consider her a friend any more. \n\nSo, WIBTA for not getting her a present?

My birthday is in 2004 so I will only be 15 later this year (keep this in mind because the girl in the story is only about 3 months older than me). \n\nMy brother is going to 19 somewhat soon (some time in march). I've never really had a good relationship with him. We argue almost everyday over the smallest things (Side note: I suspect he has autism/tourettes as he gets random bursts of anger and he has always been the \"special\" kid - YES I have tried explaining this to my mom but shes such a softie and expects everyone to ignore how badly he treats us because \"he's special\".)\n\nAnyways on to the relevant shit - remember the girl I mentioned earlier? Let's call her Jasmine. Now back in 2016 my brother and myself used to attend a youth service (I no longer go due to changed views but that's not important) where we met Jasmine, at that time she was attending the same Primary school as I was but I was only just starting to get to know her. She was also a bit of an \"odd\" person but I dont judge - we even became quite good friends. Fast forward about early 2018, Jasmine moves to a different town 15 minutes away after she's held back a year (so now shes my age but one grade behind). \n\nJasmine and I sort of drifted apart and I thought she was out of my life. Recently she suddenly started posting on her WhatsApp status out of nowhere, since I hadn't seen her online in over 2 months. These posts were all random deep and edgy quotes but amongst one of the slides was a picture of her and my brother in his room on his bed and they're all cuddled up and shit. My stomach honestly dropped and I just felt really sick to my stomach. It had to have been recently because 1. we moved into a new house and his walls are a bright colour so I could obviously see it was our new house and 2. he had recently dyed his hair which you could see in the image. \n\nI never remember her being invited to our house so I suspect he snuck her in which makes me even more ill.. I just cant believe he could do that. Everytime I look at a guy older than 17 I immediately associate it with my brother and am no longer interested. I'm honestly just really creeped out.\n\nSo in conclusion: Should I tell my mom? Or should I leave it because it's none of my business? I'm just super conflicted and could use some advice.",

I’m 18 and barely getting done with highschool, getting into college in around 6 months and can’t make a living by myself.\n\nNow we get into the juicy stuff, I used to have a best friend who left after 4 years for Seattle due to his dad’s work, he was my only friend and I found it really hard to socialize. I also suffered from bullying that ranged from verbal abuse to hardcore wedgies on a daily basis. I went into a deep depression and even though my parents always intended to give me the best trips, clothes and experiences possible, I felt empty inside and even got to the point where I wanted to end my life.\n\nI’ve come a long way by myself emotionally and a little bit longer than 7 months ago I got my first GF (who for the sake of privacy we’ll call Kayla). Kayla has always had my back and has been supportive of everything I’ve done. My dad on the other hand has been the complete opposite, he has always wanted something different from me, he’s always looked at the way I look and present myself as instead of how I feel and what I like.\n\nI met Kayla at a national academic tournament, she lives 300 miles away from me, and my dad doesn’t like that a single bit. A few days ago he blew up and called everything I like and love (soccer and Kayla mainly) a bunch of literal bs that isn’t right for me.\nHonestly I feel like it’s been several years where I feel rejected by my own dad. So WIBTA if I leave my parents, my brother and my sister for a life in Kayla’s state? Not entirely leaving for her sake, I just want to feel accepted and fulfilled.",

A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?",

I've never felt more loved, happy, and fulfilled. \n\nI've always been into drugs (weed, coke, molly, etc) but my best friend/dealer managed to get his hands on heroin. I was an idiot who thought statistics didn't apply to me and I tried it. This was 7 years ago. I didn’t touch it again for almost a year until my birthday where I did it. That turned into using it on special occasions to using it weekly and to make a long story short, I became an addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex was an angel at that time and *pleaded* with me to get help. I thought I could handle quitting on my own. I couldn't admit to myself I needed help. My personality started changing. I would get irritable and scream at her. I would gaslight her (tell her I only used once that week knowing very well I was high all day everyday). I stole from her (not to mention my parents and friends). I was never physically abusive, but I was a piece of shit and look back in shame of what I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after two years, she couldn't take it anymore and broke up with me. I was a mess. I was using a LOT more, stealing more, etc. I eventually OD’d and hit rock bottom.\n\nAfter my overdose, I knew that if I continued on this path, it WILL kill me. My withdrawal lasted for 10 days. It was hell on Earth, but I made it, and haven’t touched any drug since.\n\nI decided to turn my entire life around. I started volunteering at local schools (I worked with administration for local schools and was able to share my experience as an addict to kids), learned new skills to fill my resume gap. I got a job as a statistician a few months later (I majored in statistics in school) and now make decent money. I started working on myself, eating right, lifting, meditation, yoga. During the first couple years, it’s like I traded one addiction (heroin) with another (improving myself). I was scared shitless of becoming the failure I was destined to be in that lifestyle. I gained quite a bit of weight (muscle), look better than I ever had. I repaid every dime I ever stole (wrote them letters and checks individually).\n\nThe whole point of this context is to emphasize: I really have changed. I know I made shitty choices and I regret the person I was every day. \n\nI want to know, would I be the asshole if I reached out to her? I miss her everyday. She was my everything, my world. I’ve never had anybody else I was so happy with. When getting clean, my whole thought process was to become the man she wished I was. And now that I’m here, I just don’t know. I know I caused her so much pain. But I love her, and I want to prove to her that I’m no longer the shitty addict I used to be. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nTLDR; Former addict. Girlfriend broke up with me.

The apt is a pretty sweet contract (extremely cheap for a big city with an awesome location). While staying there, exboyfriend and my friend broke a number of items (always our best shit - expensive glasses, plates). Gave a meek apology. Whenever we have been away, we have always let her stay in our place for free. And we come back and something is always broken. \n\nThis time, she (and new boyfriend, who ive never even met) for over a week and gave a small contribution to rent while we were away (less than to even cover the rent, €150). I warned her about avoiding water marks on our new dining table which is oak and damages easily. She said she would be super careful. In the bedroom i come home to find my new €500 dresser (my 30th birthday birthday present) has been irreparably damaged with water marks from drinks, smack bam in the middle where you really cant cover it. Oh, she also broke a €40 wine carafe and left €20 to replace it. The damage on the dresser meanwhile was covered with magazines (seems to have tried to hide it).\n\nSo, i finally plucked up the courage and texted her asking what happened.

Lived together for a bit. He was solid and always had my back and I miss him every damn day. I was getting sized up for a suit to be in his wedding the weekend he passed. He had his demons as well do I and many other people.\n\nI had put thought into who would be my best man in his place and I came to the conclusion that my sponsor would be. It feels odd ranking friends like that. But my sponsor has always been there for me as well. He reached out to me in the most terrible moments of my life. He motivates me. Pushes me. I can trust him with vulnerabilities... He is the best man in my life.\n\nMy friend I asked to be my best man in place of my friend who passed has also been a very good friend. When I asked him to be my best man it was at a time after the death of our friend and I had given up 5 years of recovery. I was at a weak point and didn't apply stepwork to my life in a time of tragedy. (I currently have 5 months again). I was high when I asked him...  He is a good guy but we don't talk or hangout as much as we used to. There are some things from the past I can't get over that are making me rethink my decision. There was a girl I was dating a few years back and she was fucking my best friend at the time (not any friend mentioned thus far. We don't talk anymore.) And my friend I asked to be my best man was roommates with him. And knew for months and never said anything to me...  \n\nI wish I didn't ask him to be my best man, not only for the reason that he didn't tell me what was going on, but also the fact that we aren't super close anymore.\n\nWIBTA to ask him to be a groomsman instead and tell him it was a mistake and that I was in a relapse when I asked?\n\nTL:DR  Asked friend to be best man.

My friend wants to become a surgeon, but has not good grades, doesn't like working hard at school, and regularly skips school to line up and attend concerts.\n\nIt seems like she wants to become a surgeon to make a ton of money, she specifically said that she wants to make at least $500,000 a year. We were listening to a talk, and he mentioned high paying careers usually held by women, and at the top of the list was a OB/GYN and their salary was listed at around $120,000. She turned to me and said that all the careers listed didn't earn much. I asked for clarification, and she definitely included the OB/GYN. I feel like she has totally unreasonable expectations for the amount of work she puts in.\n\nIn addition, she wants to go to college near Major City because it hosts many concerts. If she goes to one of those schools, I feel like she will spend all of her money on concerts, and skip class all the time to go to those concerts. Even if she doesn't go to a school near Major City, she has gone by car to concerts 6 hours away.\n\nShe expects to have predictable hours as a surgeon, and not have any emergency surgeries that she will have to skip concerts for. She is fully expecting to attend many concerts as a surgeon. She has told me that she doesn't particularly like other people very much, so I think the medical school admissions people will see through her very quickly even if she does have the grades for med school.

My parents divorced several years ago, dad never remarried, and I'm his only child, so the decision about what to do with his body rests with me. \n\nDad was sick for a while before he died and I repeatedly asked him what he wanted done after he passed away.

I told him those were his only options and he needed to pick one. He always said \"I'll think about it,\" evading the subject forever and never gave me an answer. Now I have to decide what to do for his burial and none of the options available to me are things he would want.\n\nI've met with a funeral director and discussed the options, and a cremation is by far the cheapest way to go and that's what I'm thinking of doing at this stage.

I feel like I know their system better than they do, but despite pointing out my issues, they keep shifting the blame for these methods onto someone else within the company and refusing to allow anyone to do them.\n\nI had to go pressing and asking to find out simple things like my retail level so I can find out my pay grade, shit that I should have been told when signing on.

She has an amazing job and she said that she's 90% sure she doesn't want children (both things relevant to the story).\n\nShe met 'Tom' about 2 months ago. Tom is in his mid 30s, has a good job and two girls (twins, 8) with his ex. He has custody.\n\nJane and Tom met on Tinder. He immediately said he wanted nothing serious. She agreed. They went on a date.\n\nAfter a week of dating/texting each other Tom changed his mind and declared his love. Jane said it was too soon for her to know if it was love, but she was willing to continue seeing him. He pleaded her to meet his kids and parents. She said it was too early for her liking, but he insisted saying that 'the girls would really like to know my new girlfriend!'. So she met them. \n\nHis parents apparently really liked her, saying things like 'we didn't like his ex, she trapped him in a marriage by becoming pregnant on purpose, but you won't do it bc you have your life in order and a good job!' (thankfully not in front of the girls!!).\n\nJane asked Tom later what they were talking about. Tom said that it was all true, that the ex got pregnant on purpose because she didn't want to work, and then she cheated so he left her.\n\nIn two months she has been at his house practically everyday. They usually do family stuff with the kids (like family restaurants, kids movies ecc.). I know because they post everything on fb. Jane said she has to because Tom says the kids want to see her every day. The couple of days the girls were at their mom's she met all his friends (the mom sees them rarely).\n\nI asked if she sees this relationship as long term, and she said she doesn't know.\n\nNow there are a couple of (what I believe are) red flags. First the jumping in the role of a surrogate parent so early in the relationship. I think kids need stability in life. Is meeting his girlfriend so early and treating her as a parent healthy? What if they'll break up in two months? A year? Will the new girlfriend be their new mom? I don't really know bc I don't have children and bc I didn't have a let's say normal childhood.\n\nAlso is it really wise to go so fast in a relationship where your boyfriend and his parents are ready to shit on the children's mother to the first person they met? I mean maybe she is a monster I don't know but they had known Jane only for 10 days at that point! That's too much drama if you ask me.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I say I think she's making a big mistake, that could hurt her and two innocent children? Or am I too judgmental?",

I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him.

There is a chance that me and [sister’s name] could go down to [coworkers] house in orlando for 5 days. Could you stay at the house with Cookie?  It would be in late march or april. Not around Easter. I dont have anyone else to watch her. Otherwise we cant go now or on any small vacation.”\n\nI was shocked and immediately hurt and upset because I haven’t been on a family vacation in two years, or any vacation. I had also just talked with my mom a couple weeks ago about how disappointed I was that my boyfriend has no PTO time to go on a vacation with me this year (no fault of his own, he doesn’t get a lot, and has to help his parents move this year). \n\nso, my mom already knew that I have an excess of PTO that I can use, and nobody to use it with. \n\nI have always felt like my mom favors my sister more than me, because she’s the youngest, she’s 21 and I’m 24. My sister also lives with her at the moment because she dropped out of college and doesn’t work. My sister claims she has an anxiety disorder that prevents her from going to school or working, but has still not been diagnosed after about 2 years of this, IMO she’s a hypochondriac, but that’s not the issue here. \n\nThe dog, Cookie, is also my sisters dog.\n\nMy mom has taken vacations with my sister before and excluded me for other reasons, “it was your sisters birthday” , “she has school break, and you work full time “ etc..  my mom always says she wants to do a vacation with the three of us, but hasn’t since I was in high school. \n\nMy sister has no income and my mother buys her new clothes, electronics, and gave her money for a new car after she crashed her old one ( also paid for by my mom) this year. \n\nI could go on, but the point is my sister gets a lot from my mom, whereas I have been financially independent from my mom since the age of 17 when I went off to college. I don’t get her health insurance, I pay for my own phone, rent, utilities, clothes.. you name it. \n\nI have a good relationship with my mom despite all of this, we see each other often, and talk in the phone every day. I guess that’s why I’m so hurt. I was really blindsided by being excluded from this.\n\nFinally, it would be very inconvenient for me to stay at my mom’s house because it would add another half hour each way onto my commute to work, which is already a half hour. So a full hour of extra drive time, extra gas, every day. \n\nI also do not have a bed or bedroom at the house anymore, and she has not offered to pay me. \n\nI know this has been super long, so if you got here, thanks for reading!\n\n**TL;DR : my mom &amp; sister are taking vacation without me and expect me to dog sit at their home for 5 days without payment while they go**",

This baby is currently the only thing holding both sides of her family together. \n\nFurthermore, she is one of those women that absolutely loves kids and always knew she would be a mom.

So I had been friends with this girl “Sandra” for three years and we by absolute chance ended up attending the same college and summer program together. She met this guy in our program, “Hank,” who was honestly a total jerk. She originally had liked this other guy and was starting to see him but Hank won her over for a bit. \n\nSandra and I had been hanging out for awhile when Hank started to get jealous and wanted to come hang out too, so obviously there was no problem with it and he came over. He then decided that he wanted to make some food, Sandra and I agreed, but we would have to go to CVS to get some ingredients (CVS because it was the only place in walking distance and none of us had cars). \n\nSo we get to CVS, get our stuff, and we are at the checkout line. A nice woman is the cashier, whom Sandra and I had a few days prior and gotten friendly with, and there was an older woman behind us in line. Hank gives Sandra a little grief over money and then pretends to shove her. The cashier gave us a wide eye look so Hank backtracked immediately and said, “Nah don’t worry, I’m abusive and all but Sandra loves me.” The cashier was *not* cool with that and told him how it was not okay to joke about that and that she was a survivor of abuse. (I also knew that Sandra had gone through abuse previously and knew she was uncomfortable with the “joke”). Anyways, we all leave with him refusing to apologize. \n\nWe are in the parking lot, about to walk back to our dorms, and I just do not feel right about leaving. I told Sandra and Hank we should go back in and apologize and they both said we shouldn’t. They then proceeded to wonder if we should go to this convenience store on the way back, so as they’re discussing this I say that I’m going back into CVS to get a drink. \n\nI go back inside and see that the cashier is checking out the woman who was behind us, I awkwardly walk up to her (the cashier) and just say I’m sorry for my friends’ actions and that I do not agree with them and wish I had stood up in front of them in the moment. \n\nThe cashier said she understood and thanked me and the older woman started crying and said how it was “fucked up” what Hank said and how she was also a survivor of abuse and how she was so upset and angry when she heard him joking about it. I apologized again and she said I had nothing to be sorry about but thanked me. I felt awful for not stopping Hank in the moment. \n\nI said goodbye to them and went outside to Hank and Sandra, who were like “what took you so long? Where’s your drink?” So I told them the truth and said I apologized for Hank’s statements. Hank got really quiet and angry and Sandra said I should not have done that because Hank felt bad enough already. She also said now she feels an obligation to go apologize. \n\nWas I the A in this situation? Should I not have gone back in?",

It was my first time traveling without my parents and I would be free to actually explore a major city with my classmates. A few months ago, I chose \"John\" as my roommate since he was the only one I knew going on the trip.\n\nFor the most part, I enjoyed the trip and the experience but John was an excessive drinker and honestly a DICK the entire trip. John blasted music until 4am (we had to wake up at 6am since this was a school trip), was late to class activities, took a personal item without asking and temporarily refused to return it, toxic language and attitude the entire week followed by being an ASSHOLE on the final night. On the final night, I went out with a group including John to a club. At the club, John landed several punches to my shoulder and gut, and shoves that I only barely avoided landing on the floor because I braced myself each time. The punches weren't full power but they added up.The verbal abuse included telling me to go home because nobody liked me. This started at a first club where John was kicked out. We all went to the a different club, where the abuse continued. A few people tried holding John back but there was hate in his eyes. I was able to convince \"Tim\" to leave the group and come with me to a different club.\n\nAs for why I didn't tell our instructor: Most of the things I could handle and I didn't want to taddle tale. I thought I only had to tolerate it for a few more days. It was the last night of the trip that John went too far. As for why I didn't leave the group earlier: It was my first time clubbing ever in my life and I was in a foreign city where most people didn't speak English, so I wanted to stay with the group. This was all while I let him use several of my things that he forgot, called Apple Support to help him find his phone, and made sure he got out of bed on time multiple mornings.\n\nOn the way home to our college, I told John what all had happened the previous night. John apologized and asked that I not tell people what happened. I wish I could never see him again but we have the same career goal so we will likely have a class together again and see each other in the business library. While we don't really share close mutual friends, most people pursuing our career goal at my school know each other. Several people on the trip know what happened but since my school is so big, they aren't associated with people in my specific field that I hang out with. I don't want my classmates to think I'm ignoring/being impolite to him for no reason. \n\nSorry this was so long but I had to get it all out. So, WIBTA if I tell my classmates how shitty he was and ruin his reputation. How much do I tell our instructor? Any other advice?",

I am filing for divorce this month even though in my state it will not be finalized until after she is here; I moved home from his military duty station (3000+ miles away) to my family, to escape a mentally and emotionally abusive marriage. There has been sexual harassment from him that has fueled most of the destruction of our relationship. Combined with (my speculation of) him having BPD and refusal to get treatment, abuse of alcohol, physical violence like punching holes in walls when he was politely turned down from sex &amp; the fact we could not agree on counseling or therapy until I had already decided it was best for me to remove myself from the situation. \n\nHe makes me cringe. I have had nightmares of him sexual assaulting/raping me. The thought of even seeing him at her birth fills me with dread and anxiety. He acts like it’s no big deal. He is very entitled and narcissistic. \n\nI am considering not letting him be in the actual room while I am laboring/giving birth. At first I figured I would just do it all by myself and have only doctors/nurses in the room. But since I have decided I would probably only like my mother and my step mother in the room. As I feel they would be the most respectful, helpful and calming people to be there with me on that special day. I fear if I let stbxh in the room, he will make things uncomfortable and it will make me very anxious and ruin the special day. I feel sometimes I am being selfish, but then again giving birth is a lot of trauma and I feel like I deserve to be comfortable. Help!",

But now since I'm in college, I'm realizing it's a little ridiculous.\n\nTheir reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a \"goody two shoes\" I was and still am.\n\nThey're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.\n\nSo to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday). It's not like I want to do anything bad or illegal, I'd just like a little bit of freedom.\n\nI've expressed this to my parents but they're adamant on tracking me. When I try to explain that I'm 19, my mother says that she's a grown adult and \\*she\\* still has the app on her phone.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just turned the app off even though they told me explicitly not to?",

He used to be an Atheist and did his own research to come to his belief in Christianity/Creationism for macroevolution\n\nI tried to have this conversation with him multiple times over the last few months, and he gave me some examples like the Cambrian explosion and woodpecker tongue, which (I think) are classic examples of what Creationists use to argue against evolution, though they don't \"debunk\" the theory as a whole. I understand that evolution is not a perfect theory - and, like general relativity and many other theories of science, there are going to be holes.

Ultimately, he decided that it was Creationism. I decided it was evolution.\n\nI just think that you can't use theology to debate science (and he does - because he believes Christianity to be truth), but there is just so much overwhelming evidence for evolution in the science community, I just can't wrap my head around the fact that he is also a scientist yet believes this.

I obviously decline. We hadn't even talked in over a month. \nToday, his mother started texting my mom asking her to tell me that I MUST play with B, because he wanted to. My mother told BM that we were old enough to fix the whole situation if we wanted to. She told her that I wasn't resonding to him, and that that's the reason why she texted her. I did indeed not reply to him, because I told him I didn't want his company. But that was obviously not good enough. She passes me the phone..\nMe: Sorry that this has to go this way, but I told B that I do NOT want his company, because he has been treating me like absolutr garbage.\nBM: That is not true, he tells me that you have been bullying him, and that you need to play with him as a way of saying sorry.\nMe: No, sorry.\nI pass the phone back to my mother\nBM goes further..\nBM: You have been verbally abusing B, and you need to play with him, NOW!\nMom: This is *my moms name* I know he hasn't. I can hear him saying every single word he says, and he has been calling me most of the times BM started acting that way.  Please do us a favour and leave it.\nBM: I will tell him that he has done nothing wrong because I KNOW that he hasn't done anything wrong, F has told me anything that has happened, and that he is not allowed to talk or be around with him. I also demand that your son stops going to swimming practise because my son DESERVES it more than yours.\nMom: He won't quit going there and please leave us alone now.\n\nSo basically, they say that I'm the asshole, and her son is the angle... is she right? \n*keep in mind, B has autism*\n",

But STILL. Nine times out of ten we have vaginal intercourse I get a UTI.\n\nIt's gotten so frustrating that I often turn him down for vaginal because I know it'll end in twenty four hours of pain and pain-medication-stained pee and underwear (and a lot of potty breaks). It hasn't put a damper on his spirit at all since I am more than happy to please him in other ways. I am very sexually attracted to and aroused by him, and I am glad unplanned pregnancy isn't something in our future if this continues, but it is making me feel a bit guilty.\n\nI haven't made him explicitly aware of the reason we do butt stuff or oral so much besides the fact that it feels good for me. I enjoy myself immensely as well even with our modified sex life. But today, he got a little frisky while we were waking up and started fingering my vagina. It felt nice, and I was happy to oblige his desires, but now I ONCE AGAIN have a UTI to treat. I'm so done with this irritation, and am thinking I want to draw the line. I may tell him my pussy is off limits unless all parts that will be touching me are completely washed. Precaution and preparation on my part simply doesn't seem to be working. If I have this discussion with my husband, will he think I'm an asshole for making him shower before sex which could completely take him out of the mood and ruin any spontaneity we have left?\n\nTLDR: My husband's penis and fingers give me UTIs whenever we fool around, even though he showers every day and is in general very hygenic. WIBTA if I insisted on only boning after he washes himself even if taking a shower will take him out of the mood?",

My Birthday will be in May.\n\nAnyways, onto the context. I'll start with saying that I absolutely can not stand kids. I don't like being around them, talking about them or interacting with them BUT I always hide it in front of kids because I have these feelings no matter how they behave, so I can't be rude or anything to kids simply because they exist.\nSo, about a little over a year ago one of my aunts had twins. I am happy for her and I do love my cousins and I even play with them sometimes and am always nice to them, because even if I don't like Kids they are still Family and obviously if normal well behaved baby behaviour is annoying me it's not their fault.\n\nOn the other Hand I am quite vocal about my dislike for Kids and I make it very clear that even though I will interact with my cousins when I meet them I do not want to see any baby pictures or talk about baby stuff, and the most I want to hear about them is an occasional reassurance that they are okey since it is enough for me to see them at most family events. \n\nI always liked to go to family events, and I do like doing stuff with my aunts, and my grandparents and my mom (my parents do not live together) but since the children are there this has become a sensitive topic because of my absolute disinterest in anything related to babies. I don't even think my cousins are cute and especially my childless aunt (Sabine) takes offense to that. She has this giant mother complex and even though we get along very well normally there is tension between us whenever this topic comes up since I get annoyed at her for trying to force me into caring more than I can, and she gets annoyed at me for not caring enough.\n\nThe other aunt (Mel), the one who actually has the kids, understands my point of view and is actually the most civil person is this whole thing. She knows how I feel and that I try my best around her kids and I think she appreciates that I try to overcome my uncomfortable-ness around her kids.\n\nSo now that you know the context and the kind of drama this has already caused in my family I can finally explain the real conflict. I apologize for the length of this but I want you to be able to make a fair judgement so you had to know the Situation and the feelings of the persons involved.\n\nI know it will be another 5 months until my birthday comes around but Christmas has got me thinking. Since my aunt Mel had her children EVERY single family get together was centered completely around them. Times where adjusted so just she could bring them (what is fine, since I would not want her to miss out on Christmas and easter and stuff), we took extra long to let the children unpack all christmas presents her family got and no one really cared when anyone else got presents since the children where playibg with theirs and this was 'soooo cute', everyone only talks about the children and to the children etc.\n\nIt's not that I don't want my cousins to be at my birthday party. It's just that I saw today at my brothers birthday party that the twins seem to take absolute priority over the one whos celebrating and since my next 2 birthdays will be very special to me (the last one where I live at home and my last one before I will move very far away to my dream city) I want them to be about me getting together with my family. (I always have separate celebrations for friends and family). \n\nI do not want everyone sitting there gushing over the children and not talking to me, because that is exactly what happened last time and at every other family event over the last 1 and a half years since Mel announced her pregancy.\nBut because of the situation I explained above I am not in a position to just adress this as it will just be met with \"Well you should just try to include yourself into that topic! (Children)\" - I tried that already. \nSo in order to get what I want (a Birthday get together with my family where I am actually really included), I'd have to ask them not to bring the twins.\n (Important note: I do not want to be the total center of attention! In fact I want no total center of attention at all since I just want everyone to be equally included and that can't happen if the kids are there!)\n\nI would also understand if they had to go earlier because of this and offer to help them get a babysitter. \nSo would I be the asshole for asking my aunt not to bring her kids to my next 2 birthday parties?\n\n",

Month in, one of the flatmates moved out and a new guy came in.

A few months ago I asked Cat out she was on an off phase. She said she was dealing with her and Rock breaking up, but asked if we could consider still being friends. I agreed and we started having conversations through a social media platform. Suddenly, after about a month of this, Cat starts becoming less responsive (mostly responding with K or cool or yikes and shit). Then I see pictures of her, on said social media platform of her and Rock back together again. I'm a little peeved I wasn't alerted, but I'm happy Cat's happy so I just acknowledge this change in status. I'm still trying to make a friendship out of this, so I ask if she, and some mutual friends want to go out to dinner during the weekend. Cat responds that her boyfriend would be very upset if she went out, and said that we'd have to wait until next weekend. A little strange, but, we're mostly free, so we reschedule. We decide to go to a restaurant that is known for being dark. So we meet up, and right of the bat, we can tell Cat's acting very strange. She's being very quiet and seems kind of disconnected. Also she's wearing sunglasses in the restaurant, which she doesn't take off in the restaurant even though she struggled to read the menu. I suggest taking the glasses off, but she ignores this. My friend (Angel), noticed her strange behavior. She could see a little bit of her eye and noticed she had a black eye. Angel asks me to come outside, and tells me what happens. We're both shocked. Later on during the night, It ends up just being us 3. I decide to confront her and ask her how she got the black eye. She gets defensive and claims she just ran into a poll. We obviously see through the lie, but don't call her out A few weeks pass and I get the idea that I should hang out with her and her boyfriend. We talk out a date, and I agree to come pick them up. The day of the event roll around, and I arrive at Cat's place. I peer through the window as I'm walking in and I see that Rock is yelling at her and Cat's crying. I knock on the door and Rock opens up. I see a Vase has been smashed and Cat's has a small cut. I asked what happened and Rock claims her cat broke the vase. Now I'm starting to pick up what's happening, but don't confront them yet. Cat gets bandaged up, and the rest of the night goes on without incident.  Now a few nights ago, my friend who lives close to them, had to take Cat to urgent care because she broke her nose falling down. The person working their said that the trauma that caused the fracture had to be head-on. I and my friends finally came to the conclusion that she might be in an abusive relationship. But we still don't have any full on proof. Despite this I and my friends are going to try and fabricate a story, to make it look like Rock is cheating on her. Should I go through with this?",

C has what she calls a \"boy best friend,\" that we'll call K. (For context, any boy she's ever called her \"boy best friend,\" she's probably had sex with. She can do what she wants, but she's known for putting out.) Her and K had been friends for a few years, and were pretty close. But, since we're all hormonal teens, of course they started liking eachother in the other way. They had a fling, kind of a friends-with benefits thing, for a while. Nothing official, really, no claiming eachother, and keeping it on the down low.

When I arrived at our home country, I had my brother pick me up from the airport. On our way home, we were talking about my trip when my brother asked me if my cousins (who i was travelling with) do their obligatory prayers (we’re Muslims). Feeling like it was not my place to answer, I told him I don't want to talk about it. He immediately took it as a no and started talking shit about my cousins how they don’t pray and probably drank alcohol behind their parents' back. I didn’t want to hear his accusations and refused to participate in his conversation so I pretended to sleep (bad move).\n\nThis made him pissed off, so he suddenly sped up the car at an alarming speed and started calling me stupid, that i make a big deal out of everything cuz his qn wasn’t a big deal and that I treat him like shit even though he is my older brother. I didn’t say anything. Moments later, he shouted to get my attention and said “when im really pissed off, i won’t hesitate to raise my hand (ie he would hit me)”\n\nBtw, when arguing in our language, esp the word stupid in his tone, it’s a really really horrible insult and packs a lot of weight.\n\nHe started bringing up all my wrongdoings in the past like the many times i raised my voice at my mom (i also know i was wrong most times and I've apologised number of times &amp; definitely before my parents left for Hajj. ofc he didn't know this) and that one time, I wont let him use my mirror (long story). At this point, I was shocked and I wasn’t able to properly think. So I replied by blurting out his mistakes and he tried to justify them and was being passive aggressive.\n\nThen he stopped by his fiancee’s place to pick up his things and left me in the car with the engine off and took the keys with him. I called my parents who were doing their Hajj in KSA &amp; when my parents wanted to speak to him, he told them i was stupid &amp; had the audacity to shift the focus on me by saying how rude i was to our mom before. Middle of the call, he said how he won’t hesitate to drive the car towards the wall so we would die. I’ve already started crying and was screaming like a crazy person in front of his fiancee, fiancee’s dad and brother. Somehow his fiancee convinced him to stay so I can drive myself home.\n\nWhen I got home, there were these texts he left in our family group chat, calling me a fat cunt, that the next time he sees me, he’ll beat me up, etc. He also said he was happy to see me crying, cuz if he couldn’t hit me physically, at least he had the satisfaction of making me cry. He tried to play hero to my mom that if i ever raise my voice at her, he’ll slap the shit out of me for her.\n\nExcept he isn’t perfect either, he has had anger tantrums that hurt my mom badly, barely around to help my parents whenever we have house events (when he does, he does the minimum) and always takes his time that we are always late for anything. He also spends most of his time at his fiancee’s that my mom is constantly asking when he’ll come home. When our maternal grandmother passed away, he didn’t come home &amp; when my parents came home from Hajj, he wasn't around to welcome them and all the relatives were asking where he was cuz it wasn't proper. Also, he is unemployed for over 4 years since graduating from uni cuz he didn’t want to have a job related to his field, wants easy money, leeches off my parents and brother. All my other brothers talk shit about him all the time cuz of his lazy ass. We are all concerned for him and even before this, I used to cook or buy food just so he could have a hearty meal instead of letting him eat instant noodles. He would sometimes ask me to get him something and promised to pay me back, but he never did. \n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago, my parents were planning to go somewhere this Dec and asked if I would like to come with so I said yeah sure. Afterwards, my mom said dad also wants to bring the brother who hurt me and asked if it was ok. Still feeling hurt, I didn’t say anything and left the room. Later on, I was told that my dad had bought the tickets &amp; that this trip is supposed to be for us to reconcile. Apparently, my mom had been texting him and asked him to apologise to me (he is staying with his fiancee). He said that he wants to and that he’s not like that anymore. So my mom pleaded that we talk and forgive each other and I just agreed to get her off my back.\n\nMy mother is really upset that her children are fighting and I really don’t want to upset her any further. Thing is the wound is still so fresh for me and I am still triggered every time I read something on reddit or books about a similar situation. I can’t imagine going a week-long trip where I have to be close to him so I am now thinking of backing out. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not being an adult and sucking it up, and further upsetting my mom for not wanting to make up and would I be the asshole for backing out of a trip that is already paid for that is meant for us to reconcile? ",

            "input": "Tl;dr at the bottom. It's a long story.\nI (19F) met this guy (24M) a little over a month ago on Tinder. We started off great, had lots of dates... all in all, everything was going good. On our first date, he told practically told me his life story, ending with him saying he came here on a student visa when he was 20 and overstayed. I assumed this meant that he wasn't legal in the US and pretty much accepted it. Honestly wasn't expecting it to have any bearings on our relationship so soon:\nEither we were going to break up before it made a difference or we would actually work out and get to the end goal for every relationship, in which case, that would make him legal anyway (yes, I understand that immigration laws are way more complicated than this, but I'm dumbing it down for the sake of the post).\n\nFast forward to last week, he cancels a date and reschedules it for a few days after. And then he drops the bomb - \"I think this should be our last date\" and that he would explain everything then. Mind you, I do not love this man (after a month, that would be a bit insane), but I liked how we were together, so I was definitely a bit hurt about things possibly ending so abruptly with little to no reason.\n\nI did speculate that it was because of his immigration issue, but I help off in really trying to ask him about it until we met. When we do, he tells me exactly what I thought: the judge rejected his change of status and his lawyer told him he essentially had to marry someone to stay here. He goes on to say that he wants to end things because he doesn't want to go behind my back and date someone else with the intention of being with them for much longer than a few months. Then he ends with the obligatory, \"let's be friends.\" \n\nI have to say I was pissed off and maybe not for the reason most people would think. I've only known him for a month, but I am the type of person who only date people I can see a future with, so I was hurt that he thought he couldn't see a future for us. He actually ended up denying that eventually, but he was vehement on continuing to being friends. I kept rebutting his point because, imo, I didn't think he thought it through thoroughly (it was just 3 days after he got the news). \n\nSo I give him another option: what if we continue what we have, with the intention of getting married, but with the understanding that if we don't end up actually lasting, I would still help him with his situation. Just to be clear, we would have to be married for a minimum of 3-4 years for him to become legal. All of this also came with the understanding that if we did end up breaking up (but not divorcing) within those 4 years, we could date other people and stay married until we could get divorced and he could stay in the US. \n\nWe ended the date with the us agreeing to take a month off of seeing each other (but still communicating with texts that are very relarionship-y)  to really understand the implications of what we would be doing. I should also add that we ended with a few kisses too, so the relationship was a bit recovered, but with a lot of uncertainty. We both decided that we would make the decision of what to do individually, then meet up again to discuss.\n\nSo here's my dilemma: WIBTA if I decided to essentially take back my suggestion and just ask to be friends? I haven't completely made my decision yet, but if I do make that decision to not go through with it, would I be?\n\nTl;dr - A friend/potential boyfriend of mine is having immigration problems and I offered to be his potential wife for the next 3-4 years so he could become legal. WIBTA if I backtracked on that offer?\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions that would help. I hope I gave enough information though.",

They will either all pile on top of each other on the floor or form a daisy chain while standing, thrusting their crotches into each other's arses and making orgasmic sounds. They all think it's hysterically funny.\n\nI've always found it a bit embarrassing but as we got older I expected them to grow out of it. They haven't, and now some of them are married with kids, and they still do it. To me it's crossed the line from \"childish and embarrassing\" to something worse. I think it comes off as homophobic. Much like calling each other gay as an insult (which, yes, they also still do). I tried to imagine how it would look if they did it in front of a gay man and it just seems offensive. My husband, who is a bit older and did not go to school with the rest of us, agrees. To be clear I don't think the guys are personally homophobic - well, a couple of them are a little bit, but more in the \"gays are gross\" way than the \"homosexuality is a disease/sin/phase\" way - but I think what they are doing is homophobic.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told them this?",

It's for professionals in a certain field. \n\nThis field is very lucrative - starting salaries of around 60-70K out of undergrad and very common career trajectories of around 150K by age 35 (obviously not everyone). \n\nAnyways, so this subreddit does a few really annoying things. \n\n1. Some people think they're better than everyone else, including other people on the sub. Especially people who are still in college for this field. They act as if they understand everything and they are incredibly harsh with their words. \n2. Some people think they're poor as fuck. They would post comments like \"I got a 70K salary and the salary is so laughable and disgraceful.\" But it always has a tone of humblebragging - they know they are successful and capable, but they still act like they're not. \n\n\nObviously #1 is just the regular egotistical asshole. But #2 is what truly pisses me off. They are completely undermining everyone else. I chose this field, I make a lot of money, and I know that. I don't deny it and I'm incredibly grateful for it. I know I live a privileged life and none of my success is possible without the rest of society. I don't look down on anyone making less, and I don't up to anyone making more. \n\nThese people who are humblebragging are literally dragging down other professions such as teachers, environmentalists, nurses, biologists, and more. I mean we are in a field that literally gets money handed to us after undergrad, as long as your GPA is okay. \n\nI see my friends, people smarter than myself, go to nursing school and environmental graduate school and I see them saving lives. While I won't change my own career because frankly I like money and financial stability, I know that they deserve more than me. I wish they earned as much as I did, really. \n\nSo it pisses me off to no end that this subreddit is treating it like shit. \n\nThat being said, I think I might be an asshole if I make the post because I would be telling others how to live their lives and how to think.

We don't really keep track, but it usually does involve me paying at least for myself. I don't have a problem with that, but my family does. They are all pretty oldfashioned when ot comes to these things (although my parents for example are under 50) and believe he should be paying for me while we're dating (and because he has a job while I'm in college and not working). They also claim that this is an indication that he does not value me as much as he should. \n\nI have told them that times have changed and it's perfectly normal to split the bill and for the woman to drive herself to see her boyfriend as well, but they keep going back to how \"if he valued me, he'd make the effort\"\n\nAnd now I'm just getting tired of the constand arguments I suppose...

The more I wrote, the more I realised that the school's infrastructure, teachers, and school-material were the kind that I wouldn't use if even I'd gotten it for free. It was purely a way to fleece students out of their money in return for worthless certificates. I got so sick of it I didn't even invoice the company for my final payment. I was proud of that last bit.\n\nNext four years, I go through extreme depression, crippling back pain, get diagnosed with severe ADHD, spend a year and a half unemployed. I'm finally getting my life back together... attending counselling, racking up certificates, straightening out my diet and health, quitting smoking etc. Found a breathtaking woman who believes the sun shines out of my ass and wants to marry me.\n\nBut I'm still unemployed. Trying to find a job has been grotesque, humiliating experience.\n\nNow, the same manager who assigned me that previous soul-sucking job has reached out to me again because apparently I did a damn good job. They want to pay me more (a lot more) to write content for a larger, scammier university. I know that these places take the dreams and hopes of everyday people trying to make their lives better through education, and suck those dreams dry for the last penny they can squeeze out.\n\nI'm desperate for a job.

I recently got a puppy and since I don’t have a yard I take him out of the building to do his business. There’s other dogs in the building and most of them do the same thing so all the pet owners talk to each other while our dogs go potty. \n One lady I talked to was new and had a large dog she would take outside and I would talk to her to make her feel welcome. Our apartment complex only allows pets on the first or second floor. She asked which floor I lived on and I said the second and she said she lived on the fourth.   \n\n\n I told her dogs weren’t allowed on the fourth floor   (I have no idea why she wouldn’t know this since you have to sign a contract about it and know all the rules since the base is really strict about stuff like this. She also got him after they moved in to the building) She said she didn’t know that and thanked me. I didn’t think too much about it,I could care less honestly so I let it be. A few weeks later the same lady and her dog are walking around and I noticed he has a vest on. A service dog vest. I was like “maybe she got him trained because he was a handful before” I walked by her to get into the building with my puppy and the dog lunged, growled, and  barked at me and my puppy. It scared me because service dogs aren’t supposed to be like that. The same incident happened on the stair way when I was trying to go down and she was trying to go up. Her dog went bonkers and dragged her to my dog and tried to jump on me when I picked up my puppy. \n\n\n\n  Idk if he’s aggressive or just really playful but he’s a little concerning to the other dog owners or people with kids because he’s so unpredictable. I don’t want to be “that guy” or anything but that’s not cool that she’s most likely lying about it being a service dog and putting everyone else at risk. My puppy is now scared of other dogs because of these incidents. I’m fine with just minding my own business about it but at the same time she’s making other real service dogs look bad as well. I understand she probably did it to keep her dog but there’s other ways, the base is understanding and would most likely move her to a house or she could live off base if she wanted to. \n  \n    WIBTA if I told someone about this? \n  ",

            "input": "I'm 17M dating 16F that goes to another school and lives about 15 minutes away. Relationship is going great, especially considering we can only see each other on weekends. Kind of important note about her: she's fairly shy around new people and tends to be quiet when she feels she has nothing good to add.\nI'm in a groupchat with 4 close friends (was 5 at the time, 1 has cut us off, but that's unimportant). We've all known each other and have been close friends since middle school. We all have very similar senses of humor and converse very well. This groupchat (while on different platforms) has existed for around 4-5 years.\nAbout 4 months ago, we were talking about music in the groupchat. We were talking about some artists that I know my gf likes (we were technically only \"talking\" at this point but we were basically dating). I made a comment about how *gf name* would enjoy this conversation, but I didn't think it would be a good idea to add her to the chat. My friends said it would be fine, so I did. We talked about music and such for a bit that night and all seemed fine. After that night she rarely says anything at all in the chat, and if she does it's almost always a single response that doesn't add anything to the conversation. It's been this way the entire time she's been in the chat, but she reads everything that's said in the chat. About a month or two ago, I made an offhand comment to her that if she doesn't want to be in the groupchat then she doesn't have to. She told me that she's fine with being in it and likes to read the messages. We haven't spoken about it since. It kind of makes me uncomfortable having her in the chat. I feel like I have to watch what I say at times (not too often) and the jokes I make (we tend to have an edgy sort of humor). We also talk about some pretty sensitive things at times, things that aren't the end of the world if she knows about but aren't her business whatsoever either. I've briefly talked to the people in the groupchat privately about it and they're indifferent on her being in the chat. I don't know how I'd go about asking her to leave.\n\nTLDR: GF is in a groupchat with some of my closest friends, doesn't ever say anything, but likes to read the messages. Makes the chat uncomfortable for me.",

I used to hurt myself every night various ways. Basically depression, anxiety and insomnia damn near killed me.\n\nThis weekend a bunch of friends and I were gonna go camping in the middle of nowhere. However on Tuesday a friend was feeling very low and I was very worried and because I don't have my license yet I called the police and asked them to do a check on her then asked my housemate to speed to her house. \n\nMajor TW here. \n\nWe found her on the ground covered in blood, cuts on her wrists, neck and thighs. She had overdosed, unconscious, not breathing, shoelace around her neck. Called ambo and started cpr. Once they took her to hospital I went into her room and found alcohol, pills and razors. I threw them all in the bin and cleaned the blood and vomit as best I could.\n\nWe visited the next day, in her room I couldn't say anything. It was too much, she was saying all the things I used to say. No one cares, you'd be better off without me, why are you even here why do you care. \nI had planned on saying all the things I wished someone had said to me, I'd planned on being there for her and staying as long as it took. Instead, I had to dig my nails into my thumb just to stop myself from losing my shit. \n\nWhen we got home I spent hours screaming and crying, all the shit memories I'd blocked came flooding back and my urges to hurt myself came back. \n\nI can't do this, I can't go back and visit and I can't be there for her. I feel like I need to get away. I'm scared that if I keep trying to support my friend, it'll end badly for me.\n\nWould I be an asshole for leaving and having fun for the weekend? Or should I suck it the fuck up stop being selfish and be there for my friend no matter what? ",

She seemed nice enough and I drove to her city (about 5 hours away) to meet her. We decided to be roommates after meeting in person. We didn't talk much about our cleanliness habits (HUGE mistake). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after getting to school, I realize this girl is the DIRTIEST girl I have possibly ever met. She never does laundry, and keeps her laundry bag (of dirty clothes!) right next to my desk. It is so overfilled that sometimes dirty underwear will fall on the floor. Granted, the room is small and she is an out of state student so she brings more clothes than me. But, I keep my dirty clothes in a bag in my closet. NOT right next to her desk. It is embarrassing to have friends in the room because some of them have pointed this out. To make matters worse, she used to keep them right next to the futon where friends sit. So the other spot she picked was right next to my desk. I didn't fight it at the time, as I would rather it be here than next to the futon, but it is disgusting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second thing she does to annoy me is sleep on the futon. I'm not talking about sleeping on the futon once a week when she gets home plastered at 3 am. It is every single night. It is bothersome because she often does not wake up until noon or 1pm, therefore, me or any friends I have over cannot sit on the futon. I feel like I have to tiptoe around my own room when I get ready for class, as she is usually sleeping on the futon right there. Often times when she leaves for class she will leave her stuff strewn all over the futon, as she uses it like her bed! I have mentioned to her that I would prefer she would sleep in her bed, so she stopped sleeping on the futon for a few weeks. This was about 3 months ago. However, after her friends came to visit (week after winter break) and THEY slept on the futon, she started doing it again! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe does other things to bother me, but those are the main two that really drive me crazy. I provide most of the cleaning supplies for the room and do ALL of the cleaning. Her idea of cleaning is to throw clothes in her closet, whereas I actually wipe stuff down, vacuum, take out the trash etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA for asking my roommate to start sleeping in her bed again and do her laundry so that the bag is not overflowing next to my desk?

Me[22f] and my ex boyfriend[22m] were in a relationship all through high school and had a daughter when were in 10th grade and 16 at the time. We did not have a great relationship because he wanted me to move away from my family with him while he attended the college he got accepted to which was about an 8 hour drive away. We tried long distance for a few months but we broke up as I fell in love with someone else at home and began cheating and got caught.\n\nAfter a pretty shakey few months we worked out that we would try our best to stay on good terms and we decided a child support payment between ourselves based on what I knew he'd be able to support due to his only working part time while at school. Over the past 3 years I've had 2 more children with the new guy and am a stay at home mom full time while living with my father to take care of all the kids. My father recently had to quit his job due to medical issues and my boyfriend struggles to hold a job and has spent some time in and out of jail recently.\n\nSo I have three kids and am really struggling to make ends meet right now. My first daughter's father has made it known to my father in the past that he disapproves of the way I've gone about life, thinking that me having more kids has lessened the opportunities his kid will have. I've also asked him for extra money about 4 times in the past 3 years and each time he gives it, but makes sure to lecture me on getting a job and being more responsible while he's off at college not seeing his kid very often.\n\nHe is graduating this spring and will be moving onto a full time engineering job and I am wondering WIBTA for asking him to pay more money in child support each month so that I will have more money to support my whole family.",

We did long distance/only seeing each other a couple of weekends a month until a year ago, when we moved in together.\n\nOur relationship is pretty much perfect in every aspect apart from one - our sex life. Before we moved in together our sex drives were about equal, but over the past few months my boyfriend’s drive has dropped completely. He rarely initiates sex any more, and rejects me 9 times out of 10 when I try to initiate, usually saying that he’s too tired.\n\nI’ve brought it up as an issue at least 3 times now cause I was getting worried something was seriously wrong. Every time we talk about it he says all the right things, reassures me that nothing is wrong, and promises to have sex more regularly, but still nothing has significantly changed.\n\nI’m starting to feel unloved and unattractive. Despite the fact that the rest of our relationship is amazing I don’t know if I can stay with him when I’m feeling like this. I don’t want to throw everything away without trying to work on it one more time, so I was thinking of having another serious talk and explaining that if our sex life doesn’t improve, I’m going  to have to consider the future of the relationship as a whole. But I’m worried that that will come across as a threat. I don’t want to seem like I’m manipulating him into sleeping with me, I just want to get across the severity of the situation and how shitty it’s making me feel.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I told him I was considering breaking up with him if our sex life doesn’t improve?",

            "input": "Let's call this person Emma. Emma has been going through serious mental illness for a long time, believing that she is being monitored by the government or someone else through nanobots in her brain. She is almost 40 but has never been able to hold a job because of her symptoms and finally moved out of her parents' house about a year or so ago.\n\nSince then, Emma has been bouncing around living in either communal homes or in the homes of acquaintances. Most people she meets are through a network of churches and she asks members to stay for a few weeks at their homes every so often. Usually, it doesn't last very long. \n\nLast year my parents offered her the guest bedroom above my mother's office for a few weeks, but she ended up staying for over 2 months. We hoped to help her support herself and maybe try and seek treatment while she was in a more stable environment.\n\nThis would be generally fine except for the problems she caused in the house. Multiple times, she did not lock the front doors when leaving, she disrupted my mom on the days she worked at home, and even let the pets out of the fence where it was dangerous for them. The biggest problem was that, when she used the kitchen and electronic appliances, she would not turn them off and not only ruined our items, but almost set fire to the house. Her response, when told what she did, was to just shrug and walk off. The final straw was when she began to accuse my mother of monitoring her while she was in her office and putting bugs in her room when she was gone. She believes that all of this is 100% true and will not talk to a therapist or any other professional. \n\nSince she moved out she has asked numerous times to come back, but we are worried about the liability, bad atmosphere, and any outbursts that could be violent in the future (she has been known to become erratic at times). Also, my mom has moved from 2 days a week at home to every day at home and she can't work with Emma being there since she is often on calls. \n\nAn acquaintance emailed us asking for a reference for Emma to rent a room in her home. This person does not know much about her daily \"quirks\" yet and we do not know how to tell her and what we should recommend. We know that this person works away from home and would not be there often to make sure Emma is being safe in the home. The homeowner has also received many messages from Emma about the nanobots and people watching her, and this person doesn't know how she feels about having her in the home. Based on the messages we believe that her condition is getting worse and we would prefer to try and get her into mental health care rather than in a home where she is just in the room all day by herself. \n\nI think that we should tell this person not to let her rent the room at all. My mom originally agreed with me that we shouldn't recommend her as a tenant, but has since decided to recommend her with a few vague warnings as she needs a place to stay. I do think she needs support and shelter, but that this person should have our honest opinion and all the facts about liability. I have a history of mental illness, as do members of my family, and we deeply want to help her but I don't want to put someone else or their property in danger. \n\nWIBTA if I sent this person an email stating my opinions even if my mom recommends her?\n\nTLDR - A person with severe mental illness that has, at one point, lived in my house wants a reference for a new place. She caused damage to our property and was very disruptive. My mom wants to recommend her anyway, even though she thinks it's a bad idea because she needs a place to live. WIBTA if I personally reached out to the person to warn them even if it means this person may not have shelter?",

For example in the last year I went golfing 4 times with friends of mine and I went to a couple bon fires for drinks on two occasions and that is the extent of leisure time away from my wife and kids. I'm not that guy that is more concerned with my social life outside of my family. I do everything I can to worry about them first and I just try to be as selfless as possible. With that said, I feel myself failing in other ways which ultimately makes me nervous that I will fail in the examples that I want my kids to see. I am generally lazy for the most part. I mean, I keep my lawn cut and tidy but I don’t have a lot of ambition to do much else. Like putting up Christmas lights is a big ask for me for example or finishing a room in our basement you can just forget about that. I am out of shape and gaining weight as the stress of parenting picks up. \n\nAnyway, I want to be a better person and I want to change my life so that I am a better husband and father. That is where this Peru trip comes in. My cousin asked me if I would be interested in traveling to Peru and seeing Machu Picchu. That place is in the top 10 places I would like to see before I die but my wife simply has no interest in going there. So, I asked her and she laughed at me at first until she realized I was serious and then she got mad. She views it as a vacation and I view it more like a starting point on my journey to be a better person. After all, I would have to get into better shape in order to climb up the mountain to see it so it would take months of exercise for me to get to that point. Not to mention, I don’t really have any friends that I do anything with and I see a trip like that as a healthy thing. Money really isn’t much of an issue. \n\nOn top of that all, I think I am depressed which doesn’t really make sense because I have 3 amazing kids and an amazing wife but It just feels like I am in a rut. I know it sounds crazy that the way I am wanting to fix that is flying off to Peru to climb in the mountains but the chance presented itself and generally speaking the mantra I live by is that things happen for a reason. The more I think about a trip like this the more I think it could be a really good thing for not just me but my kids and wife as well. Almost like a therapeutic journey. I want to be an example for my kids to look up to and revere and I want my wife to be proud that she is married to me. Currently, I am not so sure I am totally succeeding in that goal.  \n\nSo WIBTA if I took a trip like this in an attempt to change my life for the betterment of my family? Would it change if the trip was to somewhere much closer by? Or Is just taking a trip like that period too selfish of a thing to do and I should look for other ways to better myself instead of leaving my poor wife for a week with three kids to take care of?\n\nThanks everyone!\n",

Fun loving, responsible, cheerful, etc. When drinking... not so much.\n\nMy fiance has had to live with this his whole life and I feel for him. She truly is a manipulative cunt and I don't like seeing this woman use and abuse him. \n\nShe has insulted me to the point I will not have anything to do with her. Calling him on my birthday, during which I was hosting a party for myself with my aunt and uncle, and making snide remarks about my family being dead when he said he had no time to talk. My parents are gone, grandparents too, and the aunt who took me in after they all died had just passed the month prior.\n\nHe has distanced himself. We mutually agreed to disinvite her to Christmas. She has done nothing but be nasty to everyone, and throwing a tantrum. He proposed right before New Year's and she never even congratulated him.\n\nLast night, she texted him at 4 in the morning saying that since he was able to afford a $10,000 wedding(we have to take out a loan), she wants him to pay her back the $3,000 she put down for his college education. From over ten years ago. She had to sell her 'diamonds' for that. Mind you, he's paid for her treatment facility, housed her when the family dropped her on him in his 20s, sent her money for bills even when he knew it was for fucking booze. \n\nI don't want this woman in my life, in my future children's lives, at my wedding, or anything. I cannot imagine the burden she has been not only to my fiance, but his entire family. \n\nI don't like ultimatums, but I will refuse a traditional wedding and reception if she's to be there. I would gladly give up wearing my mother's dress and get hitched at the courthouse over having this toxic human being included in her son's big day. \n\nI don't think he will necessarily have a problem with it, as he has stated he's completely done with her at this point. But his family might. They've not given her a 'tough love' dose, rather they've essentially enabled her past the point of return and I fear his family may take it the wrong way if we do decide not to include her.\n\nSo, WIBTA?\n\nTldr: fiance's drunkard mother has ordered him to pay her back for his college tuition from over a decade ago because we're paying for our wedding. Never mind all the money he's sent her over the years or housing her for free in his 20s. She's already burnt any bridge she could have with me and I want to disinvite her from the wedding but his entire family may take offense to it. I will push for signing papers at the courthouse and have no ceremony if it is not possible.\n",

She was falling over drunk so I put her in bed and I stepped out to go to the bathroom. When I was in the bathroom, I hear this giant thump. Lo and behold she has fallen from the bed onto her face (our bed is quite high up so it was a little bit of a drop). \n\nI helped her back into bed and checked her face, which honestly seemed fine at the time and we both fell asleep. When we woke up, she had a very prominent bruise and redness on the side of her face and it really did look like someone had punched her. Unfortunately she did have to go to work the next day so she put some makeup on it the best she could and went to work.\n\nWhen she got home, she told me that her coworker, who is also one of her good friends, noticed the bruise on her face and asked her if she was \"okay.\" Jess told her straight up what had happened with falling over drunk but her friend just said, \"Well in case that isn't what happened and something happened with u/stfisme, just let me know.\" \n\nWe really didn't think much of that conversation at first because it just seemed like her friends were looking out for her, and yeah I can see how the whole situation looks fishy from the outside. But it turns out that this friend has been talking to all of Jess's other friends about it and now they are all convinced I'm abusing her and that Jess is somehow covering for me and lying for me, no matter how much she tells them what happened and that they all saw how drunk she was at the party. \n\nThe other day I even had one of her guy friends approach me and say that they are all \"watching me and her\" and are all \"looking out for her\". What the actual fuck. Now none of her friends want anything to do with me and it is causing us both a lot of anxiety. \n\nJess and I have no idea what else we can do to convince people I don't abuse her.\n\nDoes anybody have any ideas at how we could be approaching this differently? I want to just tell her to fuck off and mind her own business regardless of the consequences because to be frank I think she deserves it. \n\nWIBTA if I told her to just go find another hobby to preoccupy her time rather than making shit up about our relationship?

We have a lot in common.  \n\nEarlier today though she told me she had to have a serious talk with me.  She told me that she is schitzoeffective, which upon my own research is like schizophrenia with added mental illness on top of it.  She also told me that she didn’t work like she told me, but was on disability for this illness.  I really didn’t know what to say.  She explained that she hadn’t told me until now because in the past when she’s been upfront with people about it they start treating her like she’s either dumb or dangerous and that she’s neither.  That she just wanted me to get to know her before I judged her for her illness like people in her past have.  \n\nI was as tactful as I could be.   She wanted to know if I had any questions, but I felt like she had been lying to me the entire time I’ve known her so I didn’t really want any answers from her, I wanted to do a little research about it on my own as I don’t really have any experience with this kind of illness. \n\nSo I told her I needed some time to think and went home to read up on it.  From what I’ve read it is unfortunately a deal breaker kind of thing for me.  While she might be stable now and could be for a long time, it’s likely that there will be multiple breaks for her.   There’s also a lot of evidence that this illness can be passed on through the mother’s side of the family so if it were to ever get that far any children we would have would be at risk.   She’s a great girl and I wish her the best, but it’s just too much for me to handle.  \n\nI don’t know how to go about telling her.

However, unbeknownst to Joey, his feelings for Monica are unrequited.\n\nIn my private discussions with Monica and Joey, I've gleaned some very important details about the situation.\n\n1. Monica is aware that Joey \"probably\" has feelings for her, but they've both been very passive about discussing their relationship. She's been waiting for Joey to confess his interest in her so that she could let him down. So it looks like for better or worse, she's been stringing him along for at least four months.\n\n2. Joey has told me in no uncertain terms that he likes Monica. In fact, he's already begun to refer the two of them as a couple despite it not ever having been communicated.\n\n3. Monica has feelings for me. And damn it all, I can't conceal my emotions too well. I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her too just from how much I blush with every little hint (read: very obvious sign) she gives me. I'm pretty sure it's because she likes me that she doesn't like Joey.\n\nI'm not the type to go behind someone's back. I've already relayed all the information I've listed here and more to Joey. I made it clear to him that I have feelings for Monica and that it's likely that she actually has feelings for me. His reaction has been expectedly poor, basically outright denial.\n\nI've encouraged Joey to talk to Monica about the situation, but he still hasn't, probably for fear of rejection. It's been about six weeks already and two weeks ago, I made him an ultimatum: In a week's time, I would talk to Monica about the situation to get things straightened out if Joey didn't do it himself.\n\nAs you can guess from the wording, I still haven't talked to Monica about it despite saying that I would. I really want Joey to get the closure he needs by doing it himself, because I'm sure the whole situation is painful enough and I don't want to hurt his feelings any more than they already are.\n\nThat being said, I don't want to continue to put this part of my life on hold for the sake of Joey's feelings. I feel like I've waited long enough and said everything that I could to be as transparent as possible about everything.\n\nSo with all this in mind (and more, if you need more information), would I be the asshole if I made a move on Monica?",

However, my sister told me that her friend has a lot of baggage, and that she'd prefer if I didn't pursue her. No problemo, I'll respect her wishes and just drop it. From previous encounters I know this girl has a lot of issues with trusting men because she's had a bad stretch of guys and I feel for her on that.\n\nHere's where the issue of last night comes in, one of my sister's friends is a shameless womanizer. He's a great guy and I enjoy his company, but he is very honest in that he likes to date and sleep around (no judgement there I've done the same). My sister has also previously had a fling with the guy. So my sister was progressively pushing them together over the course of the night and by the time I left to go home they were making out in the bar. I'm concerned that my sister has set her friend up to be hurt by a guy that she knows is a womanizer when she knows her friend is looking for an actual relationship. While it technically is none of my business it's the kind of behavior she's exhibited in the past where she's unintentionally set a friend up to get hurt by trying to play matchmaker and not taking into consideration the consequences of her actions. I would like to confront my sister about this kind of behavior and how it can it be toxic not only to her friend but also to her friendships with people and her friend circle.\n\nSo WIBTA if I opened my mouth and told my sister that it probably wasn't a good idea for her to push them together?

I always knew she had mental issues, but she seemed to manage them to an acceptable degree, and during the first while, I didn't mind.\n\nHowever, after we moved in together, especially the last 2-3 months, it's gotten... Really bad. Anxiety, depression, general mental health issues, and it's become so bad recently that it's dragging me down too. We've talked about it many times, including the possibility of getting professional help, but she refuses, she only wants to work on it herself, or at least with my help.\n\nHowever... Nothing has changed, in fact, it's arguably gotten worse since we took active attempts to get better. This is where the second part comes in. Her lifelong dream is to have a family, 3 kids, a dog, suburban house, the works. I've never cared much for it, but never had much of an opinion on the matter either. However, recently, I've started to have an epiphany that I might not want that life... At all. We've discussed it before, and we agreed that I would tell her again if it became a real thing, and she would understand. Life goals change, that's just how it is. However, I'm not sure if I just, don't want that life at all, or if I don't want it with her... With all her mental health issues, I don't see her being able to be a good mother (daily anxiety attacks, caused often by disruptions in her daily rhythm... And kids aren't exactly predictable), and I'm scared I'd effectively be a single father.\n\nNow, the dilemma is... It's true, that I don't think I want the same future she does. 90% sure, but there's still a chance. However, the main reason is her mental health. I don't think she'll get better unless she gets professional help, certainly not better enough to look after 3 kids and a home. But she's made it very clear that she will never go to a psychologist, or similar, again (bad previous experiences), and nothing I can say will change that.\n\nSo... WITBA for using the \"I don't want kids after all\" excuse? We've talked about it before, and she's said she'd understand, these things change sometimes. I feel like it'd be easier for her to handle than her mental health, which is a... Very touchy subject for her. On one hand, I feel she deserves to know. But on the other... It won't change anything, she won't see a professional anyways, so what does it matter?\n\nPlease do give your opinions, I'm a bit at a loss here.\n\ntl;dr: I will probably break up with my girlfriend due to her unwillingness to seek help for her mental health issues. Should I tell her the truth, or tell her an, also true, but less so, reason?",

Which in their eyes means you cannot be christian/pro life and be vaccinated at the same time. \nI am the oldest grandchild on that side, and I also have a younger brother who is super close in age to me, we were both fully vaccinated before any of these cousins were born and both had no issues (obviously). However when the next closest cousin was born and needed her vaccinations, she cried when the first shot was given so my aunt refused to continue because she swears she “heard the autism working through her”. So, after this none of the others were vaccinated. With the exception of two boys who were adopted, so legally they had to be. In that case, my grandparents held a prayer service around them and prayed for god to make the vaccine faulty and forgive them. \nMy parents have tried relentlessly to teach them and they refuse to budge on the subject. \nWhen I heard this today, I immediately told my family that my future child will not be around the cousins until my child is completely vaccinated. \nNow, my mother and father think that I’m being too extreme and that it’s not a huge deal. Saying that because I’ll be vaccinating my baby, that I should not be worried. \n\nSo here’s the question: Would I be the asshole to continue through with this? It would certainly hurt my grandparents and aunts for them to hear this from me, but I feel that my future child’s well being comes first. Do my parents have a valid point? (I should add that I am not currently pregnant, just had this conversation with my parents earlier) \n\nTLDR: Grandparents and Aunts are anti-vaxx in regards to my 9 cousins, I told my parents I won’t let them around my future children, parents say that I should let them around since I’ll be vaccinating my own child anyways.

It was really rough growing up and being so outnumbered all the time so i love to \"bro out\" for lack of better words. \nCurrent story: TDLR at bottom We are all in early 20s. Once we all graduated high school my mom moved into a much smaller house 20 minutes away and allows us to live in the old house for very cheap (she doesnt make money or lose money, we pay utilities, taxes, etc) until we get on our feet as adults. My 2 little sisters both took the deal(while me and twin where in college, they didn't go) and have since bought their own house or moved out the area. I recently graduated, moved in and got 2 roommates, keeping 1 bedroom open for my twin if she decides to live with us. The thing is I don't want her to. We live together during the summers and dont get along. We went to the same college and went out together and had fun, shes one of my best friends, but when we are together too long we arnt nice to each other. My 2 roommates are long time friends and Id say now they are just as much friends with my sister as with me, they have no problem with her moving in. \nThe thing is , I love the atmosphere of the house, its the definition of a bachelors pad (pool table in dining room, bench press in living room, bikini posters, deer heads, etc). Im worried that my sister might kill the vibes living here when she could very easily live with my mom 20 min away(for free) and visit whenever. The only thing is she has expressed excitement for being roommates and I really don't want to hurt her feelings because she is sensitive and its not like its any more my house than hers. \n\nAdditionally, my little sister that moved away is talking of maybe moving back in and sharing the room with my twin. This would be 100% a nightmare, my little sister is not easy to get along with and those two sharing a room would be awful for everyone involved. The thing is my mom said little sister cannot live with her(for above reasons) but twin can. Plus I wouldnt mind little sister living here as much because she would just stay in her room all the time and because she is intellectually disabled and she worries me being alone in the city. \nTDLR; Mom lets us stay in other house for very cheap. I moved in made it a bachelors pad with 2 friends and don't want my twin sister to live here. WIBTA to tell her this as it will likely hurt her feelings",

She cannot wait to have my 'regular' last name. \n\nI should also mention that we are both women. The jokes that come when meeting new people get old real quick. \n\nThe more I think of sharing the same last name the more I don't want to. It seems like its going to open up a massive can of worms - things like opening mail, bills, future child custody and even signing off on emails is just going to be confusing for nearly everyone we interact with, having two moms may already be confusing for our future kids let alone dealing with day cares, schools, doctors etc. I'm going to get really sick of *\"which Jane Smith are you?\"* I'm also not a fan of the prospect of having to put my middle initial on every correspondence and every interaction for the rest of my life. *'Yours sincerely, Jane A. Smith'* I think would make me sound like a right punce. \n\nTo me, it seems that changing her last name won't actually make her life any easier, in fact I think that it will be worse and bring me into the mess at the same time. \n\nI've subtly mentioned that it won't be a good idea to which her response is that I don't know how hard it has been for her her whole life.

We really can not afford a hotel in the area she lives in. \n\nWe offered to throw her a small shower for everyone here since we are all family and want to celebrate. She does not want two showers. I should say that my brother doesn’t want two showers. I have not spoken to her about this, but I know my mother has spoken to my brother and he was livid at the idea of us not attending. \n\nI feel this is a lot for her to ask of us.

She has very few friends, maybe 2 or 3 she relies on for support. She's in college, but her parents always guilt her into giving them her scholarship money (and spend none of it on food or the counseling and medications she needs).  They actively push her toward breakdowns in order to keep her under their control.  She's not at all at fault for her situation, but...\n\nShe won't let anyone help her, and won't do anything to help herself.  She has access to free counseling at school to help with her mental issues, but refuses to use them because she \"already knows what her issues are and how to fix them but is too lazy\" (her words, not mine).  She's had multiple people offer for her to stay with them while she finds a job and gets her feet under her, but she refuses under the guise of not wanting to freeload, even when given the option of a \"live-in maid\" situation or an agreed upon payment plan.  She wouldn't let herself or anyone else notify authorities when her 15 y.o. sister was being fed roughly four meals a week.  Every day, she talks in our group chat about how awful things are, but ignores everything we say.  If she says something hurtful to one of us, instead of apologizing she blames her situation and how she \"can't get the help she needs.\"\n\nI've tried everything from offering to buy her food to stash at home, to letting her become my roommate, to paying for meds.

She told me there was no point trying to convince her, she would just be gutted if I saw them again without her.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I went to see them again without her?

He’s a bit older than me (he’s 28 and I’m 23, we started dating two months before I turned 18), they gripe about his job, his schooling, occasionally his physical appearance, and continue to try and set me up with other guys, especially ones from their church.

They’re between our jobs and only 15 minutes from my school, and the rent is extremely good compared to everything else in the area. We figured it would be a good idea to get an apartment now since we plan on getting married in October, and when I brought this up to my mom she flipped. Asked why I couldn’t just wait to finish school to move out, why I couldn’t wait on getting married, etc, and I just reminded her that I’m getting married and asked where I would live. She suggested getting a trailer out on our land near their house but to me that’s basically the same as living with them. She’s been huffy ever since but whatever.

I admired this family member a lot. However, after starting to work with him I’ve lost an incredible amount of respect for him. To make a long story short I worked for him for less than minimum wage for 3 months, watched him treat workers like shit, make people feel guilty for taking breaks which are their rights as workers, make them feel bad for asking for their checks that are past due, etc. He favors the workers that will work overtime for free, who won’t take breaks, who will bend over backwards for him for no cost and meanwhile will call the workers who take their breaks, work when they have to, etc “lazy”. I watched him basically blame everything under the sun on my coworker (who eventually became a friend) until he found a new job and quit.

I work the same amount of hours every single week and as time progresses, he’ll pay me for less and less hours. I know it’s not an accident, he knows exactly what he’s doing.

You don’t need it.” I’m living with my mom, typically have very few expenses (I pay for gas, and other things here and there) and am pretty well off to be completely honest.

He has quit in the past but he is right back at it. I realize we are probably all assholes for drinking around him, but he is my friend and I want him around. I dont wanna stop hanging out or cause any drama due to the drinking, and the rest of us dont really seem to have any problems with our consumption habits. Anyways... that is not him being an asshole, just thought it would help paint more story. \n\nRecently, he is becoming REALLY mean and aggressive. He and his husband had roommates who were also a couple. Lets call them AC. He had asked AC to move out. No hard feelings, just wanted his space. So AC moved out a month earlier than asked to leave. This did not cause any financial issues for Greg, it was a good thing. Apparently, AC had asked to leave 2 guitars and a box of bathroom stuff for an extra day as their load was full and it was getting late. Greg agreed. The next day AC did not get around to picking up the belongings, and all hell broke out. Th next day Greg is telling AC that they are never allowed at the house again, and all their left possessions will be thrown away or sold. And any mail coming to the house would also be thrown away, and demanded the house key back. telling AC that they are no longer friends and just freaking the fuck out. This is all somehow justified as complete \"disrespect\" To me, this is nbd its just a day!\n\nGreg has been having dramatic freak outs just like this over small annoyances. He is getting progressively aggressive and it is affecting everyone in the friend group. He will start fights with me or his husband when we say things he doesnt like, and will scream and slam doors if we ever tell him we dont agree with logic or reasoning. \n\nIn the past I have brought up that I dont appreciate his temper, and I want to figure out ways to build our friendship to avoid these crazy fights, and it did not go well at all. I had to apologize for months before we went back to full time hangouts again. \n\nI just learned that others feel the same way as I do (we try not to gossip about eachother) and although I feel scared about the outcome, I just keep feeling like something needs to change or it will just be the end of us. I really dont want that to happen, cuz I love the guy, and his husband is also my best friend.

The thing is I don't even see a reason for them pretending to be my friend. Some are in my classes at school and I help them out and share homework, but some aren't even in any classes of mine. Am I over reacting or is it time to find new friends? Wow I feel much better after typing this rant. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

She does this all the time with candy, snacks, lunch, etc. and doesn't seem to take a hint. She means well and I can see that, but it is very annoying that she can't just take the no.

I told her that I want my things back that I bought for her then, seeing as I was essentially being tossed away. I calmly asked her to return the Monitor I had lent her, and upon asking, she called me a selfish cunt, then blocked me on every form of social media. I got my monitor back, but only because I had asked her cousin to tell her that if she didn't return it, I would take her to court.

I’m afraid to talk to anyone because I don’t know what the right thing to do is here. \n\nThe background to this story is that I moved in with a roommate, let’s call her Hannah, in August. We didn’t know each other before but got closer as one does when living together. Hannah was an artist, funny and we got on super well. She passed away just before new year’s in a bike accident. This was very hard for me, but nowhere as hard as it was for her family and friends. Her boyfriend Jake in particular was devastated. \n\nA few days after Hannah’s funeral, Jake asked for her keys to get some of her belongings. I was at work that day but when I got home that night, he was a sobbing mess. I don’t know Jake well, but he was crying in my roommates’ room, so of course I tried to help. Jake asked if he could stay the night because he could not handle going home now. \n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Jake sometimes stayed in Hannah’s room which I did not mind. I don’t know what it’s like to lose your partner but losing a roommate hurt so much already, so I can’t imagine what it’s like for Jake. Sometimes other friends of Hannah and her mom would come too. As her heir, her mother offered to pay Hannah’s part of her rent until they felt ready to deal with all of Hannah’s belongings. I told them to take as much time as they need. \n\nAfter that, Jake stayed over almost every night. But it started to change from him trying to be close to Hannah to him kind of living here. He would sometimes cook in middle of the night or watch movies without headphones, which would wake me up. As I was on semester break and was only working part-time, so I didn’t say anything about it. For context, Jake is a freelance producer and doesn’t have standard office hours. \n\nThey have started to empty out her room about two weeks ago, and I’ve decided to stay out of it because it’s part of their grieving and I didn’t want to disturb. Now, the room is empty except for her bed and her piano. \n\nOn Monday, my semester started again. I told Jake about this, that I would have to wake up early again and that I’d try to not wake him up. He promised to be quiet at night too but hasn’t. \n\nAdditionally, with the third rent coming up, apparently Hannah’s mom is unable to pay for it. Like for most people, having to pay for another place must be expensive for her. The landlord has been amazing and simply put the rent contract on my name in January. But this means that I’ll have to come up with the rent money from now on and this is a big burden for me as well. This is why I’m considering looking for a new roommate. \n\nIt’s Sunday afternoon, I’m sitting in my room while Jake is in the kitchen making lunch for himself. And I’m asking strangers on the internet if I would be the asshole if telling Jake about wanting to find a new roommate and asking him to go back to his apartment.",

She usually only does this when she wants to have sex, so I jump in the car and get there quick. When I get there, it's clear that she's a bit nervous. She invites me in. I ask her what's up and we talk for a bit. She gets all flirty with me, but that's normal and whatever.

What do you want to try?\"\n\n\"I know this is gonna sound weird, but I need you to be open-minded and not judge me.\"\n\n\"I'll keep an open-mind, sure.\"\n\nShe reaches to the table behind her and brings out a pair of handcuffs. She explains to me that she always wanted to try a slave/master roleplay with me. She elaborates that she's always had fantasies about completely dominating \"a strong man like myself\", and how her status as a woman in society means that she doesn't have many chances to be \"in control\" when with a man, so she likes to play it out in the bedroom. However, as she goes on, I feel more and more on edge about the situation. Considering that I minored in African-American Studies in college and the simple fact that I'm a black man living in America, I think it's understandable that I'm a bit wary of the implications.\n\nWhen I bring this concern up, she gets defensive. She explains that this isn't a race thing and that she's done this with her non-black boyfriends in the past. She admits that she took a while to bring it up because of my race, as she didn't want me thinking she's racist. I leave, saying I need to think about it.\n\nIt's been a few days and I still don't know what to do. Ever since that night, whenever we've talked, she's brought it up and asked me if I felt that it was okay. I keep dodging the issue though. Every time she asks she seems more frustrated with me. Hell, I'm frustrated in myself for not just sucking it up and doing it for her. I get where she's coming from btw. I get that people don't really have control over what they're turned on by, I have fetishes myself that she's indulged in.

On the weekend, they will run around in only a nappy (diaper) and nothing else. I feel so bad for these kids they will literally be in what looks like the same nappy for the whole day. I really think they are well old enough to be using the toilet and some of the other children in the street including mine ask them why they still wear nappies. It doesn't really seem to bother them though.. the only one using the toilet is the 7 year old. \n\nThe other thing is they come inside my place without pants on and want to sit on the couch and watch tv and I feel like a arsehole coz it grosses me out these visibly wet with pee nappies and I ask them to please go home and put pants on or play outside.\n\nShould I tell their mum to pull her head in and toilet train her kids so they stop being teased at school. I have to add there is nothing stopping them from wearing underwear and using the toilet its just their mum being lazy.\nOr should I simply mind my own  business?\nAITA ?",

It just felt natural with me. \n\nUntil I entered creative writing class as an elective this year. I slowly started to notice everyone else was better than me and got really discouraged. I was debating whether or not to hand an assignment in when my friend, who I met in an English class last year asked to read my stuff.\n\nSo I reluctantly let her and another of our classmates read it. They praised the story. They offered criticisms of course, which I explicitly asked for. Multiple times. I even said that they should tell me if it’s straight up awful and I’ll just scrap the whole thing and start again. But no they said they liked it a lot and that it was clear, easy to read, and original. \n\nSo I trusted them and handed it in. After all, they’re better writers than me and must know what they’re talking about, right?\n\nWell either they didn’t or they lied to my fucking face. I bombed that assignment. Not only that, but the prof basically wrote in the notes section that completely went against what they said. While they said it was easy to read, clear, and original, the prof, (being an author himself) said it was clichéd, illogical, and incredibly confusing. He also said it doesn’t even sound like the writer know what he’s writing about. \n\nIt’s not the fact that he wrote that that gets me. It’s that my friend outright lied to my face. When I asked her to tell me how awful it is, if it is, multiple times. And I told her several times when we met for lunch and stuff that lying is by far the worst offence you could do to me. Aside from doing extreme things like killing my whole family and shit like that. But you get the point right? \n\nI hate being lied to. All my friends know this. I don’t care if the truth hurts. I need it. Because when I don’t hear it, I go and I embarrass myself. I feel deeply hurt and betrayed because I trusted what she was saying was true. I feel like an idiot. I’m normally forgiving but this is where I draw the line, and it’s the one thing I have a really hard time forgiving. (You could literally punch me in the face out of nowhere and I’d probably forgive you.)\n\nWIBTA if I told her I’m not going to be talking to her anymore? ",

I was able to pay off my student loans from my BA early, and I'm completely financially independent. My needs are met, plus a little extra fun money and a vacation fund I manage to meet my goal on every year. I actually love the pace of it and always having twelve different deadlines to meet, I find it very invigorating. Honestly, everything about my job is perfect except for the way that people perceive it. I've gotten a lot of reactions along the lines of \"Oh, really? That's not what I would expect from you,\" probably because I am an outspoken feminist and people don't expect me to be in a job that's considered \"women's work,\" especially one where there is the perception that I am subservient to a male attorney. *I* know my job is more than making appointments and fetching coffee (not that there's anything wrong with that either,) but I have to admit that these little digs get to me. I've got pages of information on law school bookmarked even though I'm certain I don't want to be a lawyer. Usually it's enough for me to be happy with myself, but it absolutely stinks to be told repeatedly that I should be doing \"more.\"\n\nAnyway. One of my lunch buddies is an attorney and a couple of months ago he said he had a friend who would be great for me. I met him for coffee and we hit it off like I had never done before with anyone, and within a couple of weeks of the best dates and conversation I've had in my life, we decided to date exclusively. And my new boyfriend is, you guessed it, an attorney.\n\nHe doesn't even work at my firm, but the optics are terrible. And let me tell you that people have not been shy at all about pointing it out. One woman in document services told me I can quit and be a housewife now that I've \"pulled one.\" I've been asked how short a skirt I had to wear to get his attention. I know for a fact that there's been plenty of talk going around of me being a gold digger. Worst of all, someone started a rumor that I trade oral sex for longer breaks. Even my own mother told me that maybe now I should think of quitting and getting into \"a more family-oriented mindset.\"\n\nI don't want to give up on this relationship because my boyfriend is truly amazing. I know it's early, but I want to see where this goes. He's got a kindness to him that is so modest and genuine, and has such a wonderful outlook on life, and I feel like our personalities complement each other a lot because I am more bombastic while he is a bit softspoken, and I just...really like him. And knowing that people see me as a gold-digger who hikes up her skirt to get attention from some sleazy attorney absolutely kills me. I don't want people to think that I \"pulled an attorney.\" I don't want to have to deal with the sideways glances and whispers that stop the second that I enter the room. Part of me wants to end it while it's still early so there will be as little hurt as possible. I don't want to be two years into this relationship and be dying inside because I'm \"that girl\" at work. Would I be the asshole if I threw in the towel and said \"You did it, society, you beat me down.\"",

So, Mark just uses our utilities and shared food without paying anything, and it’s started to bother me a bit. I’m also a little annoyed that I almost never get to hang out in the common spaces of my own apartment because they are always there. This also means that I have to wait to use the kitchen/bathroom until he is done a lot of the time. They are also pretty loud until they go to bed and start right up again in the morning. I’m also uncomfortable that I can hear them being physical all the time.\n\nHowever, I have people over sometimes and it can get kind of loud, and so does Mary. So, Mia would probably bring that up if I tried to talk about Mark. And maybe it would be overstepping to try to tell her when she can have people over.

            "input": " \n\nThis is partially a WIBTA, and partially a rant because there’s a lot I need to get off my chest. TLDR at the bottom. Here we go!\n\nFor a bit of background, I live with 4 other people. My SO, my SO's mother, her roommate, and her roommates daughter (7).They'll be refereed to as SO, M for SO's mother, R for roommate, and D for his daughter.\n\nMy SO and I are renting a room out of M’s house, for roughly $500 dollars between the two of us. M is a bitch, R is a slob, and D is a spoiled brat. I absolutely can not stand living here with them.\n\nR’s room, which is down the hall from ours, is so dirty and disgusting we can smell it from halfway down the hall. He doesn’t clean, he steals my cigarettes, doesn’t use soap washing dishes which leaves greasy pots and pans for us to rewash, and constantly begs for money to buy beer. He wastes any income he has on whatever his daughter wants. \n\nD is fairly well behaved for a 7 year old, and all of her shortcomings aren’t hers to blame, but R’s for not teaching her. She stays up late into the night playing fortnite with R, hides her homework so she can go home and play games, soaks up my internet running Netflix while she sleeps, throws her toilet paper in the trash across from the toilet, and won’t eat anything but candy because he allows it, already causing her barely new adult teeth to rot out.\n\nR and D have separate rooms, but D’s room is so full of whatever shit she wants, that she still sleeps in Rs room. Which I feel being a single father, sharing a room with your daughter when she’s 7 is a bit inappropriate. But maybe thats just me. That does though lead to me and my SO sharing a tiny ass room between two adults and one whole room left unused because of D. \n\nM is where it gets tricky. As said before she is my SO’s mother, and would particularly be the one that I would screw over. She isn’t too terrible of a person and I don’t want to dislike her due to the fact that she will in time be my mother in law. The thing is, she constantly bitches about R and D to no end, but refuses to do anything. She won’t get them out, she won’t take D’s room away. She’ll just complain. She’ll complain and bitch about everything. The most recent being me leaving a single pot on the stove. I get a text at work from her going off about how there are a million dishes in the sink. There were quite a few dishes in the sink. ONE of them was mine, and that ONE was the only one there when I rushed out the door already late to work. Did I mention R will hoard our entire kitchen in his room and bring it all out at once, tossing it in the sink? Yea. He but the blame on me. So she bitched and bitched all day about how she won’t clean after grown adults, if she has to clean messes she wants more money. She knows my income is tiny, and that Im about to be a full time student. It’s entirely disrespectful how she handled it, immediately calling me out over text without trying to assess the situation at all. And this shit will happen at least once a week. I’m getting sick of it. \n\nNow to the WIBTA part. M is struggling to make ends meet on the house, which I believe is the only reason R and D are still there. She gets the majority of money from me and my SO. When I first moved our plan was to move out asap, but I decided I wanted to take it slow and give her plenty of warning so she could make arrangements for a new roommate or however she wanted to handle losing our income. But now after nearly a year of being treated with complete and utter disrespect, I’m about to say fuck it. I no longer want to give her that luxury due to the way I’ve been treated here. I’m about to come into a monthly stipend for school from some benefits that I have. Enough to get a decent apartment. The second that money is in my pocket, my plan is to move out within the month. If my SO and I were to leave with hardly any notice, she would more than likely be forced to sell the house. Would this make me the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor clarification, this is not an official landlord-tennent situation. There's no drawn up papers, official agreements, or leases. We all pay her under the table rent month to month to live in her house.\n\nTLDR: Awful roommates, “landlord” treats me like shit, if I were to move out with little notice, she would no longer be able to make her payments, and would in turn lose the house.

She went out with several of her colleagues, had far too much alcohol and ending up sleeping with one of her male co-workers. I ended up finding out the next day, when she got home and confessed everything. She was so genuinely regretful and seemed terrified of losing me, that I ended up forgiving her.\n\nHowever, we're now facing a different problem. My wife is pregnant and we both know it's not mine; I'm infertile. My wife swore that, if I wasn't comfortable raising another man's child, she would be willing to get rid of it or go it alone. The thing is, we've both desperately wanted children from the start. IVF wasn't something we could afford and we're fairly certain we'd never be able to adopt. After a day or so of thinking it through, I told my wife that I wanted to keep and raise the baby. \n\nMy wife is now roughly four months pregnant and we just broke the news to my parents. Knowing about my fertility struggles, it didn't take long for my mother to connect the dots and realize that the baby wasn't mine (I had gone to her after my wife confessed for advice). She didn't take it well AT ALL. Since she found out, my mother has been constantly telling me to divorce my wife and let her raise \"the mistake she made\" on her own. When I refused and told her that I want this baby, she switched to instead guilt tripping me about how the baby's real father will want to be involved. (Spoiler alert; he doesn't. He doesn't want kids and refused to even talk to my wife after she told him she was pregnant.)\n\nShe's gotten worse over the past couple of days. She was so supportive when we considered using a sperm donor last year, so I'm utterly baffled as to why she's suddenly decided that I shouldn't raise a child that isn't mine. Last night was the final straw. She decided it would be A-OK to give me the ultimatum - make her get an abortion or divorce her. No. Fuck no. I love my wife more than anything. Yes, she made a mistake, but I am not going to hold it against her. I've known about this baby for a little over a month and I've already grown attached, even though it isn't mine. \n\nMy mother's behaviour is driving me up the wall. I haven't let my wife see any of the messages she's sent me yet, though I worry she might start harassing her about an abortion soon. I'm considering cutting my mother out of my life until she pulls her head out of her rear. This behaviour isn't okay and I'm not having her upset my wife over a mistake we've both moved on from. Yet, I hesitate to actually cut her off because...she's my mother. I love her and I desperately want to see her come around.\n\nWIBTA if I cut my mother off for this?",

At the time she got pregnant we were in a \"friends with benefits\" stage as we had split up. Before either of us new she was pregnant i decided to leave the country and Travel for a year. It happened very quickly, from the date i decided to go to the time i left was less than  months. She was extremely upset when i told her i was going but we weren't together and were fighting a lot at the time. I really didn't see a future for us. When i was a few days from leaving she told me that she could tell me something that would stop me going, however, i never found out what it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out she was pregnant. I had been gone about a month when i found out she was pregnant. She told me to continue my travels and enjoy my year that the child would be there when i got back. I thought about it for a few days and decided the right thing to do would to be come back. So a few days later i was on a flight back. To this day i do not in any way regret coming home. We talked when i got back and decided to try work things out for the sake of the child. In fairness it was me who ended the relationship as i was going through a lot of things mentally (I had a horrible childhood), so i was happy to give it another go. Knowing i has a child on the way i went full steam into finding a way to provide for my family.  I got a job and fast forward a few years later i have had several promotions and was making good money. I was providing for my now two sons and wife but i was deeply unhappy. \n\nI was working 50-60 hours a week to make sure they needed for nothing. Then in 2016 my mental health issues spilled out and i became suicidal. I look back now and see that it was always there from my childhood just below the surface. I ended up leaving my job cause it was killing me inside how much i hated it. My mental health got worse and i was hospitalized for my own protection. After a very long stay in hospital and a lot of counselling and hard work plus medication and now i m doing a lot better. I know for those 2 years i was sick i put my wife through hell, her not knowing if i would take my life was extremely tough on her. She became the provider for the family while i was unwell and she still is to this date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now my issue (finally!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September of last year i went to university to follow a dream i had since my childhood. The degree i am doing has a big workload. I had consulted my wife about this before i took the course and she agreed i should do it that we would make it work for the 3 years. Since i have started i constantly get pulled away from doing college work. I barely get the chance to stay late to study as my wife keeps taking overtime so i come home to take care of my sons. Once at home i try to study but the kids are constantly needing attention. They are both between 8-11 so they are big enough that i don't need to keep my eyes constantly on them but not old enough that they can mind themselves. I am barely getting a chance to study and i am exhausted trying to balance everything. As a result i am failing my course. I want to tell my wife she needs to put me first and do less overtime. She also constantly goes over to her sisters house leaving me at home saying the kids are in there rooms so i should be able to study. My sons been the age they are constantly fight so i do have to stop them and cant get to study constantly for a few hours.\n\nI constantly gave up things i was interested in, went without so my kids could have whatever they wanted. paid all the bills so my wife could mind the children. I think it is time for them to give me the freedom to do the degree. WIBTA to say to them that i gave up everything to give them what they wanted and now its they're turn to give me what i want for three years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's probably the most expensive thing I own and I love it to bits, it's very rare that I'll splurge on something like a game system.

I've been aware of his autism since we met in elementary school but we had similar interests and I have an autistic brother myself, so I could handle being around him well. He did have a bad temper growing up and holds grudges easily. I kept reminding him in the years after high school that high school was over now and we have no reason to even think about people we went to high school with again. We're now in our mid-20s and our friend group has drifted apart anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved to Europe for a year in 2017 and that's when I first noticed him making posts against people from his past. As I hadn't spoken to him in a while I didn't feel a need to respond to them. However, starting in 2018 he started referencing me and my friends by name. He started to say things like \"They're lucky I don't punch them if I see them\" and things along those lines. He's posted them every few days for about a year now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, this week he said \"I hate people from my past, never trust a person named u/bruins125 .\" Seeing this I felt the need to call him out. I sent him a message saying that I've been following his messages and that if he needs to talk I'm here and would be willing to meet up again but if he says anymore threatening messages I'm contacting the police. I ended with saying \"Ball'sin your court, hope you're doing well man.\" He never responded to my DM, but instead 2 days later he put on his story \"If the balls in my court I'm gonna strike you on the head with it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother former classmate I was also friends with at one point stabbed two people in the public library of our home town, one of them fatally. This classmate had been going insane for years before, started off by admiring the Virginia Tech shooter and harassing classmates online (myself included). He also said threatening things to me in the past and I feel like he was looking for me/other former classmates before he did it (the person he fatally stabbed was a year younger than us). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still feel guilty about the attack, as he said threatening/definitely illegal shit to me when he was starting to go crazy and I feel like if I said something the murder wouldn't have happened. I'm now getting deja vu, except now I'm worried this other guy is going to attack me. Some of my friends agree and want to contact the police as well, but others think he's harmless and say he's only saying those things because he's unemployed and lonely. I want to believe the latter, but at the same time I'm worried for both my own and some of my old friend's safety. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA? Thanks in advance!",

Lots of people can’t get past the age part, but I would ask that you ignore that for now—I just added it for a little extra context. I am an incredibly helpful and kind stepmom type of person to his 13 year old daughter (but I’m not quite viewed as the stepmom, it’s a funny in between). I take her and her friends to and from school, to dance every day, help with homework, make them food, do all the grocery shopping , etc. I bust my ass every day to be the best family member/stepmom thing possible. \n\nSo this week, I have had an insanely busy schedule between my full time school, teaching piano, helping with his daughter, cleaning the house, and still trying to take care of myself. I am worn thin to say the least. Every weekend, his daughter and all her friends (which is always a lot, she’s pretty popular) come over and trash the house, and no one is responsible for cleaning up besides me. We have tried to work some sort of cleaning/chore list out, but so far it has been very unsuccessful. Because the house gets trashed every weekend, weekends are not exactly relaxing for me—in fact, they’re quite the opposite. Having his daughter and her friends at the house causes me insane anxiety, and I always feel like I have to be trapped in my room because it’s so uncomfortable for me to be around the kids (because I’m pretty close to them in age). Yesterday I spent the entire day doing homework, driving carpool, cleaning, working, that I didn’t get to work out (which is really important to me). Meanwhile, my fiancé is watching movies and played 2 hours of tennis. \n\nI am so worn thin that this weekend I needed some peace to myself. My fiancé is on a road trip with his brother and I am to stay home to rest. His daughter thinks we are both on the trip though, and because the house is empty, she is not allowed to have people over or be over here at all. \n\nFast forward to me right now hiding in the master bathroom trying to make an escape while 15 teenagers are blasting music in our living room. She has obviously broken the rules about not being over here, and doesn’t know I’m here. I am so so bummed and I’m crying because I’m so exhausted and just wanted to have some peace to myself.  \n\nSo would I be the asshole for calling my fiancé to have his daughter leave?\n\nTL;DR: Would I be the asshole for secretly asking my fiancé to arrange for his daughter and her friends to leave our house?",

            "input": "TL:DR I went into roommate's room behind their back and found that the condition of their room is likely causing a busted a/c unit, along with spiders and roaches in the apartment.\n\n*Important pre-context:* roommate isn't just some random person. They've been one of my closest friends for about 15 years and they recently moved in with me because they were having some financial trouble (by *trouble* I mean reckless spending and no personal budgeting to the point where they couldn't handle their rent on their own).\n\n*Also important to note:* while we're generally comfortable acknowledging each other's personal space at this point, I totally get that it's not typically okay to go into somebody's room without asking first. They've told me since they've moved in that if I needed anything for the common areas that they haven't yet unpacked or we initially didn't think we'd have room for, I was welcome to go into their room, and 'rummage' through their boxes to get it. I still feel like a shitty person for going in though, so I'm having trouble deciding how to feel about and approach the following situation.\n\nBefore they moved in, I was already aware that their cleanliness isn't all that great. So I made a point to make sure we had an understanding that I don't care what they do behind closed doors in their room and bathroom, as long as they respect the common areas and to keep in mind that my apartment has been known to host spiders with a cockroach or two (gross, I know), especially during warmer weather. Because of this I've always been super anal about making sure my place is clean, as in no food or dirty dishes lying around, no clothes on the floors, nothing that could potentially make these asshole critters think I'm running a buggy-brothel. Basically I told them, obviously it's your room, your bathroom, do what you want, but be mindful about the basics.\n\nIt's been about three months now. Their door is always closed and we're on completley opposite sleep and work schedules, so aside from the weekends, it's rare that we even cross paths. Noticed a week ago that the central air didn't seem to be cooling. I had this problem last summer, so I told my friend that if it got too warm or stuffy, just open their window and let me know that way I'm not trying to force the air unit to overwork with windows open. They insisted they were fine, but okay. Air seemed to be okay for a few days until it this week, I noticed it again. Except this time the register was reading under 60 even though my bedroom and the living room felt like a sauna. Asked them if they had the window open, and if they noticed the warmth at all. They said no, they were fine. Figured I'd just put in a maintenance ticket tomorrow morning and have them look at. Brushed it off, turned the unit off and opened all the windows knowing I went through this with them last year.\n\n*continued in comments due to length*",

Usually they'll play games til around 7, then start a movie and at the latest be done by 10. I started going with him when I lived with my parents still so I had a curfew of 11pm. Reasonable. Then we moved in together, and started working tuesdays so i had to stop going. I was okay with it and every once in a while id have a Tuesday off where I can go watch movies. \n\nSide note: he also has game nights at our apartment 2-4 times every week that usually last past midnight. I have issues sleeping so its hard for me to fall asleep with a lot of noise and when he comes to bed eventually. \n\nSo today I was getting off at 2 and he gets picked up near me at 4, so i decided to go. I cant have my phone out at work, so I never got any of his messages which he knows. He first tected me saying movie night might be cancelled, which happens sometimes. Then he said WE were going to play games at friends house. We do this sometimes too, and try to wrap up around 10 so no one has to drive very far at night (the farthest someone lives from friemds house is 40 miles/about an hour in our area even at night)\nI texted him when I got off saying id be okay with that. \nSo we show up at friends house at 4:15, its not 12:30am and they decided to play smash for 8.5 hours. Never inviting me to play, they didnt stop for food, and they only played the same fucking game the whole time. \nThis isnt the first time its happened and hes even called it a \"date night in\" before. The closest thing weve had to a date in the last 8 months is one of these movie nights we went to see a movie in theaters. He has work every week day and has to get up at 5:30am and complains about being tired all the time. \n\n\nSo now to my questions\n\n1. Would I be an asshole if I told him he needs to stop having all these game nights past 11p?\n\n2. Would I be an asshole if I told him he both A) needs to be WAY more clear as to what \"we'll\" be doing if plans get cancelled and B) i will not be going out with him and his friends unless I know whats going to happen?",

I broke up with her because we were in a long distance relationship for 2 months (we both had to go different colleges) and I felt extremely depressed (being in a new environment, not knowing anyone or anything, being alone) and confused about life. So I messaged her telling her I wanted a breakup, telling her my situation and she basically didn't give a shit. So after breaking up with her and even though she didn't care about me, I instantly regretted it and felt even more alone, wondering how someone could be so cruel and uncaring after I spent 3 years with them, and fell into an even deeper depression. I felt so bad I even had thoughts of self-harm. Five months later I felt horrible and I felt so alone, so I texted my ex, telling her I really missed her and that I loved her and she coldly told me to stop contacting her. I've sent her a few texts over the years but I think she blocked me and is mad at me since she hasn't responded (though the texts I've sent are very friendly). Thing is, I think things have really cooled down, my depression has gotten better, and since we haven't talked for over a year, I was wondering if I would be the asshole to try and smooth things over and possibly get the relationship back or is she the asshole for not even trying and listening?",

Lets call the junior manager \"Cruella\".\n\nMy uncle is an asshole and that is why none of his children help in running the company- they all work outside the country away from him. My uncle controls all power in the organisation and micromanages everything.  However, he is old and has only me to leave the company to. I mention all this because I have reported the problems that Cruella causes and my uncle does not do anything because she is his favorite. I also do not have the power to fire her until few weeks from now when my uncle's retirement date comes up.\n\nI have 3 managers under me and Cruella is the only one out of them who disobeys my orders, especially if it means that she has to work for me. My uncle gave her control of a division of the company that is very new and profitable, and this has gotten to her head. She refuses to give reports that would help us maximize efficiency and profits in the division. She only gives reports when she feels like. The irony is that when she needs help and has exhausted all options, she runs to me. I have cautioned her numerous times but she never cooperates knowing that only my uncle has the final decision and power to punish her. \n\nMy uncle covers for her because he wrongly thinks that she is making the profit for the division she controls. She gets her staff working like clockwork and she works hard. However, she costs the company about 30 cents on every dollar of profit as her delayed reports deprives us from adjusting on time to certain costs. The issue here is that she did not set up the division- I and my uncle did. She also is not good with numbers as I have to correct her reports consistently.\n\nTo show you how nasty Cruella can be, she even got rude to my uncle's oldest son (my cousin). Can you imagine that she had the nerve to try to remove my uncle's son (who is a silent partner and technically her boss) from a staff meeting? Of course, my uncle covered it up and apologised to my cousin for her. That was when I decided that I would fire her when I have the power. Also, my cousin gave me his blessing to fire her after that incident as he was pissed with both my uncle and Cruella. \n\nCurrently, I am thinking of firing her and not giving her either a severance pay or her would-be last month pay.  I truly want to punish her for being insubordinate and for abusing the favour that my uncle has shown her. The funny thing is that we are in a country that has very weak labour laws. I can fire her without any problems. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I fired her without pay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She's moved 3 times since last August because her roommate was flaky and ended up getting them both evicted.

We have plenty of friends in town who'd be willing to host when she's visiting; they've done it before for other friends. \nI thought a lot about this when my friend briefly lived with me, but since I knew it was temporary, I never communicated it with her.

I’m not qualified in nutrition but I have a personal interest due to starting weightlifting and such. I’ve encouraged her to seek out therapy and offered to drive her to a clinic so she can get professional help. Or see a nutritionist. She refuses to admit she has a problem, my advice to her tends to be ignored. I  called my own doctor to ask what I could do, and he basically said I can’t force her to do anything since she’s an adult. She’d have to come in herself for any sort of treatment. \nSince I’ve been living at home with her and our parents since Jan, I’ve been trying to cook meals for everyone’s lunch, stock the fridge and pantry with snack foods, make dinner a couple times a week, and overall just be helpful/supportive as much as I can since I’m the only one who doesn’t have a commute to and from work. But what annoys me is that my parents seem to enable her eating habits by telling me to buy x food because my sister ate it this week, instead of addressing the problem.\nMy sister will binge on a certain food for days until it’s gone but if I try to buy the same foods again, she will not touch them. She has a very limited list of foods that she has deemed ‘healthy’ and she will eat but if I prepare them in the wrong way, she also won’t touch them, (for instance, chicken is healthy but if I flavor/season it with something she doesn’t consider healthy, she won’t eat it). I’ve asked her what she would like to eat repeatedly. I’m getting really frustrated at this point because she will straight up ignore me and pretend she didn’t hear my question and I’m exhausted trying to find new foods she will actually eat or work around it. It’s basically a guessing game of what’s going on in her head. The lack of communication is what really irritates me. I’ve been spending a lot of time either cooking last minute alternates or stepping out to buy foods when she suddenly decides she won’t eat y or z foods, when last week y and z was acceptable. \nI know it’s a mental health issue and I feel like the jerk for resorting to this, but WIBTA if I stopped trying to cater to what she eats and just say: Fuck it, this is what I made for today.

He told me to hop in the discord server so we could communicate with comms and play some dumb stuff on fredboat. We hopped in to a game and I was asking him to talk in discord and he responded with hisses, like really loud hisses which hurt my ear a bit. The match went on and he wouldn't answer my questions with a single word. He just kept hissing as a \"response\" to my questions for about 2 - 3 games.\n\nNow this isn't Doug's first time doing this sort of behavior when we play games, it usually happens when he's memeing in Rainbow Six, and other games. He would talk normally, he's fine in the head. We're good friends for about quite some time, years in fact. But to me I just clicked during the 3rd game and told him.\"Alright, I'm done, I'm tired of your shit it's quarter past midnight and I'm stuck with someone who's hissing to talk.\" And I just turned off my PC and went to bed. The day after the incident I noticed that Doug has blocked me on Steam, Ubisoft, Discord, etc. So I'm quite flustered as to why he would do such a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould really like your guys' feedback on this, I would really appreciate it",

She was very vocally against this saying \"we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get.\" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \\*\\*her\\*\\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that \"this is just my belief about \"those women\" and that she didn't mean \\*\\*me\\*\\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me \"taking her wrong\", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.\n\nI complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.\n\nMy next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child\n\nShe has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).\n\nI am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I be an asshole if I file a complaint against her?",

I told him that I would- under the condition that we break up afterward cause I knew I would resent him for his choice. He decided we should keep the baby and stay together. He wanted absolutely nothing to do with the pregnancy. He kept telling me how he wish he could just fall into a coma and never wake up. He didn’t want to see any sonograms. Didn’t want to touch my stomach. Didn’t want to talk about anything baby related until a month before he was born. Now that my son is born everything is great and our relationship improved drastically. My bf loves our son to pieces and is a great dad. \n\nNow the problem.\nWhen my son was born in India we didn’t have an English name for him yet. We needed a name for his birth certificate so I gave him an Indian name(I’m half Indian) and we decided we would put his English name down when we apply for his American/Australian citizenship. \n\nWe finally agreed on a name and we were onboard for Sterling. We have until our son is 18 to apply for either American or Australian citizenship so of course we’re in no rush so nothing is set in stone yet. NOW almost a year later bf wants to change the spelling to Stirling. I think that spelling is absolutely atrocious. I argue that it’s ugly, and I still have some resentment from him wanting to terminate our son in the first place.  He argues that I already got to choose his Indian name and Sterling was too common of a name (is it though?) \n\nI saw that he had a point. But every time I had to write down Stirling I physically cringe. I just don’t get how he’s okay with Sterling and suddenly switches to Stirling a year later. He’s stalling on the Australian citizenship paperwork so I figured I’d go and turn in his American citizenship first so I can solidify the spelling.\n\nMy family + friends think Stirling is ugly too and should just go ahead with my plan. So I need unbiased opinions from the Internet.\n\nTL;DR\nMy bf wants Stirling and I want Sterling. I think I have naming rights cause he wanted to abort the baby. He thinks he has naming rights cause I chose his middle name. WIBTA if I solidified the spelling by applying for his citizenship before my bf does?",

Tl;dr at the bottom in case I end up waffling on.\n\nI (22M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend (23F) by this time next year. \n\nSo backstory, my girlfriend (L for reference)is obsessed with weddings. She has an obsession with watching wedding tv shows (especially ones focussed on the dress) and loves pricing up hypothetical weddings. All of this I'm completely fine with as I know I want to marry this girl and I think the world of her and marriage at this stage would have been a natural thought process regardless.\n\nThe reason that is all relevant is because she basically has an entire wedding planned out for if/when she gets married. I myself have no preconceptions about what I want for the wedding as long as the food is nice and there's at least one or two good beers on tap so I've said to her if/when we get married, she can basically plan it all. (This is not me burdening her with an incredibly stressful job, she beamed ear to ear when this suggestion was made, if she does want my help and input I will happily help).\n\nAlso she is a shopaholic. She shops at every opportunity she gets and it is her favourite way of passing time. \n\nIn discussion about weddings etc she tells me she has said her dream would be to shop for her own engagement ring. I myself want it to be a surprise when I propose and pick out the perfect ring for her to show her how well I know her and for it to be a surprise.\n\nNow, she can be fussy when it comes to jewellery. She is always grateful when it is bought for her and wears it when the person who bought it for her is around, but you can tell when she actually likes something or not as long as you aren't the person who bought it for her. Noticeably, she won't wear it unless that person is around. Hence why she has always wanted a watch but has never bought one due to how picky she is.\n\nRecently, when shopping I have noticed if I go into a shop to look at watches for myself I have noticed that she will get bored and look at rings so I have started playing a game of 'guess my favourite watch' as she will return with 'guess my favourite ring'. Because of this I have a list on my phone of every ring she has pointed out as her favourite and because of this I feel I could find a perfect ring. \n\nBasically I want to surprise her when I propose to her and sweep her off her feet by doing what she deems impossible and give her the perfect ring to go alongside what will hopefully be a perfect day for her. So WIBTA for risking messing it all up by doing something she explicitly said is the opposite of what she wants?\n\n\nTl;dr: my girlfriend has always dreamed of shopping for her own engagement ring but i want to surprise her with a well thought out perfect ring.",

I then went on to tell her that since her family is close to me, they were definitely coming. She found it kind of funny, but honestly seemed pretty concerned.\n\nTo give some context: I would absolutely invite my mother, and my grandparents. I wouldn't invite any of my 16 (8 by blood, the other 8 married in) aunts and uncles, any of their children, and not my even my sibling. My sibling hasn't made an effort to keep in contact with me since they moved to the other side of the country. My aunts and uncles tend to be attention seekers, and rude.\n\nMost importantly though, they also don't help my grandparents, who are dealing with a lot right now since my grandmother has dementia, and my grandfather had to retire to take care of her. I love my grandparents and stop by all the time to see them, and it breaks my heart that the have about 50 grandkids and great grand kids (ages range from almost 40 to 3), and none of them stop by or even call.

On the other hand, my friends family invites me to family gatherings, takes care of me when they have the chance, and legitimately put in the effort to ask me how my life is going. I would definitely invite her extended family, who practically treat me like their child.\n\nBut then again, I see lots of other people who invite their family who they aren't close with, and I feel like a jerk.

If they found out my friend's family came, they would probably be really hurt, especially my aunt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my family isn't close to me, but my friends family is.

I am currently attending a private religious school that is different than Catholicism. While I respect the religion, and others beliefs, there is a lot of hypocrisy as well. Obviously many pray a lot, and while that is great for them, I do not find it helpful to get me through a difficult time. I am resentful over religion and a big dislike of my church is how often I have been blasted for being bisexual and how I will end up in hell for it.

This has been going on for a few years and we've been pretty pumped to watch the finale together for just as long now. It's great fun and a good way to see them as I don't get the chance all that often.\n\nI mentioned this little tradition of ours to my girlfriend before we even started watching GoT so that she wouldn't be surprised by it, however when she brought it up last night she seemed pretty upset that I hadn't changed my mind about not watching the newest season with her and with my friends as intended.\n\nSo WIBTA if I choose to stick to tradition and not watch the newest season with my girlfriend?\n\nTldr: Girlfriend is upset that I'm choosing to watching newest season of GoT with my friends as we have a tradition for it, even after we plan on binging it up until release.",

Shes also failing 3 classes\n\nI know people change but I dont like my friend has become. Everyone knows her as the drugged out slut. I love her obviously, but she wont listen to me when I tell her she cant keep doing this and going down this path. I've been telling her all year, and so has my whole dance group, and it's only gotten worse.

            "input": "I'm on my phone, so sorry for formatting issues. Throwaway account.\n\nTo give some context to the title, my parents split up a year ago and my mum was devastated, without getting too far into it, she's been struggling to handle it. She has however, thankfully, got a lot of people around her to support her. She goes out multiple times a week, and a few months ago agreed with a friend they'd try to meet up every weekend, they often go out when they meet up too. \n\nSince she's started going out more, she began telling me about men she got chatting to. At first I was just happy to hear her talk about something other than my dad, I liked the idea that she may be starting to get over it and be open to the idea of a new relationship, but then it escalated. \n\nIt became at least a weekly thing that a new guy had approached her, flirted with her, and she'd then inform me she'd been talking to them over text. The thing that gets me though, is her talking to me about these men has now turned into constant complaining about the inappropriate things they say to her, or how they want to date and she isn't ready to date. Often she'll say they said inappropriate things whilst they were out, and then as you'd expect, they'll behave the same way when texting her. She tells me way too much information about what these guys said, and I've already nipped that in the bud because nobody wants to hear about the intimate details of what these men want to do to your mum in the bedroom, she still tries to tell me often but I shut it down straight away. \n\nBut my main point is that I'm getting to the point where I'm fed up of listening to her tell me about all these men trying to get with her, and the sexy talk they try to engage her in, when she's giving out her number to people already doing this stuff in person - What does she expect? She always has an excuse when someone asks her why she gave them her number (because she doesn't just tell me this stuff), and it's always playing off like she had a totally innocent reason to do it, like she wanted them to tell her about fun things happening in the area (as opposed to just googling it?) \n\nI've heard her friends say she's leading men on just to stop talking to them in a few days and she denies it and says she isn't interested in them and she isn't ready to date yet, but I believe she probably is leading them on. I've been out with her before, one on one and with her friends, and whilst she has sometimes been approached by interested men, this is happening all the time now, and giving out her number when she knows they're interested I feel is definitely making them think they have a chance. I feel she must be doing something whilst she's out with her friends to be getting all of these men talking to her, and I feel a bit bad for the guys who seem actually nice, who want to go out on dates, because they think she's interested too.\n\nThe thing is, if I tell her she should stop giving out her number, I don't know if that makes me an A-hole because I'm inserting myself into a situation she seems, ultimately, okay with. Nobody has explicitly said to her \"Well, what do you expect? If you don't want these guys to try to sleep with you then stop giving them your number when they've clearly shown signs of wanting to sleep with you.\" But I feel it's because everyone feels she's enjoying the attention from the men. She definitely uses it as a confidence boost, she'll start saying stuff about look at what my dad's missing and she can get guys still. It's helped her stop obsessing over my dad so much, which is why initially none of us thought anything of it and liked she was coping better. I don't think anyone wants to stop her having fun, but at the same time, none of us want to hear about the vulgar things people say to her, or how she's been asked out and how crazy that is as she isn't even interested, every time we meet up. I really don't know if this is something I should let her navigate herself, or if it's a good idea I say something to her.\n\nShould I tell her to stop giving her number out? Should I just leave her to it? Is there a better way to handle it?",

He absolutely loves to assert himself as being smart, and tends to get very competitive about.\n\nOne of the ways this manifests is with backseat driving.  I don't drive him often (we're both adults and neither of us live at home/with each other), but when I do, it crops up, especially if he's in a bad mood for whatever reason.  These are not comments that are necessary reminders, they're usually pissy little asides like \"You didn't have to let that car go ahead of us, you know\" or \"You don't have to change lanes yet, but whatever\".  Dumb shit like that.  I've asked him to stop before and he's always said \"I'm not being snarky, I'm *helping* you.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I hate this, and I honestly find it distracting as hell.  Probably the worst case of this happened a year ago, when it was pouring horrible rain during a three-hour drive that he wouldn't stop commenting on.  He kept insisting this was for our own safety, though he didn't at any point offer to drive in the downpour.\n\nThere is a family event coming up that is going to be 1) about a ninety-minute drive, and 2) really early in the morning, so he will probably be cranky.  We might all be able to go together (in which case, our dad would drive us over), but if we can't, I may have to drive him.  If he starts in on it, would I be the asshole if I threatened to pull over?  If he kept going, I'd pull over and say some variation of \"Either you drive us the rest of the way or you stop talking.  Every time you make another comment, I will pull over again.\"\n\nI realize this makes it sound like I'm chastising a child, but at the same time, I legitimately don't know what else to do (other than just not driving him, period, which would cause a rift with my dad/the rest of the family).

I have a boy under 2 &amp; hes got a girl who is just shy of starting school.\n\nWhen my neice was born, my mother pulled out the baby clothes from when my brother &amp; i were babies, having saved them specifically for her grandbabies to have. (She bought them for my brother and when i came along, i wore them too.) Sister-in-law wanted nothing to do with them for neice. Most are pretty gender neutral, so when my mom was babysitting and neice needed clothes changed, she would put on some of said clothes (a pair of jeans for example) so she could enjoy the outfit for a while, but SIL would come to pick her up and change her out of clothes before heading home, leaving childhood clothes at my moms house. We never asked wtf but theorized that maybe its because they were too masculine looking.\n\nFast forward a few years and i have my son. My mom gingerly asked if i would like the clothes, expecting more heartbreak over it but i was thrilled &amp; said hell yes. My little guy rocks the clothes pretty frequently &amp; grandma always has a huge grin to see him in them.\n\nNow, i found out my brother &amp; SIL are expecting a boy. So I'm stuck with the dilemma of what to do about the baby clothes. I feel im obligated to offer them to her as they WERE me brothers first, but she has a history of refusing to put baby in them. I worry about it because she is definitely a \"gift horse in the mouth\" sort of person and has told us often of recieving a gift that wasnt the \"right brand\" so she sold it and put cash towards the \"right\" one.\n\nMy concern is if i give her the clothes, whether on not they are worn by future nephew, that she will toss or sell them in the end. If she doesnt want them or they didnt have any more kids, i intended to put them away for my grandbabies to inherit.\n\nWIBTA to not offer her the clothes?

            "input": "To give this situation some necessary context, here are some details of varying importance.\n\nMy wife is a pharmacist and I work in education. She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\n\nAlright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\n\nSo a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\n\nA lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\n\nSo at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\n\nLast Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \n\nOf course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \"not for me\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\n\nI'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA. \n\n",

            "input": "My close friend M has (self-diagnosed) bipolar disorder which makes him isolate himself for long periods on end. These episodes happen very suddenly--he'll go from sweet and affectionate to extremely cold and standoffish from one day to the next. Like, we'll hang out as usual, and then the next morning he'll be 'gone': no texts, no calls, nothing. He won't respond to any attempts at reaching out from my side either. Then, whenever the episode is over, he'll bounce back acting like nothing ever happened.\nIt's confusing because during his 'good' times he is very vocal about how much he loves and appreciates me. I adore him as well--I feel a deep connection with him and have always tried to be there for him through whatever happened in his life (family troubles, stressful new job, several moves). \n\nTo illustrate: the latest episode has now been going on since late November, that means no contact at all since then. I texted M the other day asking to meet up because I wanted to talk to him about something that I didn't want to discuss over text, to which he replied (to my surprise) that he could meet on the weekend and he'd keep me updated. Friday comes and goes by, so does Saturday. He then texts me late on Sat asking if I could do Sunday, to which I replied sure, but only in the morning/noon since I had work later in the day. Nothing came after that. Now it's Thursday and I'm somewhat hurt that he didn't even tell me he couldn't make it, especially since I see he is active on social media. I definitely understand that being online doesn't mean feeling well enough to socialize, but I would have really appreciated at least a short heads up. Also, I see him liking lots of tweets about how people with BPD love the ones who stick with them through periods of isolation and how getting mad at them when they ignore you will only make them isolate themselves further. \n\nI understand that he doesn't ignore me because he hates me or whatever, but rather that his illness makes him want to isolate himself. The only real problem I have is that these periods happen without warning, can last very long, and I am expected to just bounce back to 'best friend mode' whenever he does. The current situation has been pretty bad for my own mental health and although it may be selfish, I also feel really upset that I can't help him with whatever he is going through that makes him isolate himself so much. \n\nI am now considering trying to get a hold of M to tell him that I don't want to continue the friendship and explain my reasoning. I thought about taking the current isolation as a hint, so to speak, and just not reply whenever he feels like being my friend again. But that would feel like an asshole move to me. I don't want to hurt him and I wish I could just remain untouched by everything, but it really does take a toll on my mental health and I don't think I am equipped to handle this behavior at the moment. \n\nAITA?

I don't know if she's in counseling or if she takes medication. I've always tried to be a friend for her to talk to, but we aren't the best of friends so I know she has her reservations.

I came out as transgender to her. She didn’t take it well. The first few months were tough. She mocked me, yelled at me at any moment, and refused to acknowledge me.\n\nShe told all my friends’ parents about me coming out, and my whole family. The dad of my best friend at the time, J, stopped letting me hang out with J. I even caught her talking to her coworkers about me being trans on the phone. Keep in mind, I asked her to tell no one. When I heard her telling her coworker I recorded it and confronted her. \n\nShe yelled at me for being awful and selfish, not letting her have her support network to deal with this.  \n\nThings got worse when I told her about some of the mental health stuff I was going through. I’m [a multiple/plural]. There’s just a lot of people in my head and we all just live together. I’d come a long way since when it first started when I was 14. I was functional and successful, I’m talking straight A’s and never got in trouble. \n\nShe took it poorly. Telling her is the biggest regret of my life. She made me see a psychiatrist and after talking to me for 15 minutes he prescribed me risperdal, a powerful antipsychotic. She was hoping it would cure my trans-ness I think. My mom told me I was hurting my family and friends, and that I should do it for them.\n\nFirstly, risperdal got rid of everyone else in our plurality. They’re gone forever. It also made me incredibly depressed. I almost died. I started failing at school. I begged my mom to take me off them. I even pretended to not be trans for a bit. \n\nA month after they took me off the risperdal, my mom decided to try to put me in a mental hospital. She convinced my family I needed help and they turned my yearly physical into an intervention.\n\nAt this point, the affects of the risperdal on my mood were gone. So I argued I didn’t need to go. She said my friends talked to my mom about how they were worried about me. That I was being a burden to my friends. I found this to be a lie later, but at the time I bought it and agreed to go.\n\nWhen I graduated high school and moved away to college, I started to realize how toxic and manipulative she is. I also starting going to therapy again, this time for my issues with her.\n\nBut despite me asking, she would not apologize for what happened. She said she’d do it all again and doesn’t have any regrets.\n\nThe thing is, she did all that stuff out of a twisted form of love. She was doing what she thought would be best for me.

Backstory my husband’s mother had a stroke a few years ago and has no husband or anyone to share her life with so we try to fill in as much as possible. She is still almost 100% mobile. \n\nTo sum it up my husband works out of state during the week and we only get weekends to spend together and he spends at least half if not more of the weekend with her. I encourage it to an extent because she lives alone, though I resent it a bit as it deeply stresses him out but if he chooses to spend the whole weekend with me, she usually causes a blowout fight and does something irresponsible(she once bought a car she couldn’t afford after they fought because he wanted a weekend to himself). God forbid we choose to vacation without her the world might end. We have given up multiple opportunities to do things because she would be very angry at him for spending his vacation time away doing something she couldn’t do. She is very manipulative and will bring up how she’s “going to die soon” whenever he wants to spend time without her. \n\nOur house is undergoing a remodel currently and when it’s finished I want to bring up the idea of renting the house out for extra income and moving away. Not out of state just somewhere else. We’ve discussed wanting to start a family soon and have expressed that we’d like to have at least one child before I turn 30 or at least before he turns 35. \n\nThe thing is I find her to be a terrible mother/grandmother. My husband has two siblings both with 5 year old girls and she’s constantly criticizing their parents decisions, disciplining the kids when it’s not her place etcetc. She’s also obviously very emotionally manipulative and she downright abused them all as children. His two sisters don’t even really spend time around her and she makes it a very big deal that she’s so sad about that. I know myself enough to know if she tried to pull the things she does with her daughters we would have a very bad relationship as I’d easily fly off the handle if she tried to treat my children the way she treats her other grandkids. \n\nI feel as if she’s guilting my husband into thinking he has to involve her in our lives and our future child’s life because “everyone else abandoned her”.  I want nothing to do with it, I feel like we need to start our own lives and she’s preventing that. When she’s spoken about us having children before she already has inserted herself further into the equation than I’m comfortable with especially given that my family isn’t as close I feel it would be unfair to my family to have her involved as deeply as she expects to be. My husband has expressed similar sentiments while frustrated with her but when it boils down to it I believe he will cave to her manipulative ways to avoid feeling guilt. \n\nWIBTA for suggesting I want our lives more separate from her and would like to raise our children without her involvement?",

            "input": "My girlfriend and I have been going out since June last year and apart from the situation with my family and the restrictions I have on me, we have a good relationship.  \n\nAt the start of this year we signed up to a gym and it was going quite well for a while. Soon enough more and more people started coming at the same time as us and because she has some issues with anxiety, uncomfortable feeling towards and being scared of all boys, we started actually going to the gym less and less; opting to just hang at hers instead. This carried on off and on for a good few months, with us sometimes being able to use the gym instead of us driving away once we saw the parking lot having too many cars. Throughout this whole ordeal I admittedly have felt annoyance at the whole thing. Her reasoning being that she feels like everybody is watching her and that makes her really uncomfortable and what-not. I tried telling her that they're just doing their own thing, etc to which she replies that she knows that but her mind will still think that so she will still have that feeling. I generally accept that and usually we cancel gym for tonight and instead go to McDonalds to get her a frozen coke to make her happy and then just chill at her's until I gotta be home for my curfew. \n\nRecently we cancelled our membership with that gym and signed up to a new one that has much more space and is definitely better. We knew coming into this that the gym would be more busy as it's a more popular gym and what-not. Ever since we signed up almost two weeks ago now, the first couple nights since the membership we didn't enter because she saw quite a few people (mainly men) working out through the window so she couldn't enter at all whatsoever. That night I was like okay, I understand and drove off. The following night we managed to get out off the car and was about to swipe our cards to open the doors when she noped out and said she couldn't do it. I said \"really?\" A couple times because we were so, so close. She got quite upset with me for that and I tried to explain to her it's because we were so close and all she needed was just that one more step, but she wasn't having it. Shortly after I managed to convince her into trying again somehow, I am usually very shit with my words and mess things up but I succeeded this time. This time we got in and it was great.  \n\nFrom then on, we manage to get in the gym but we usually have to wait in the car until the person who just arrived gets in the gym before us, or any people outside enters/leaves and are out of the parking lot. I'm fine with this as it's just a minute or two thing, no drama there. It's just to further elaborate on how she is. \n\nWhen we're in the gym we typically do five mins of cardio and use that time to gauge how many people are leaving/entering the gym and whatnot, and to give the area we want to go to that little bit more time just to see if the people in there leaves within that time frame. If they don't, we either go to the weight room where all the heavy weights and machines are and sorta work out there half-assed, not really amounting to anything. Last night when we went, and a couple of times actually, she expressed that she feels uncomfortable and that she wants to go/sit in the car and that just makes me feel disappointed because I want to work out with her, and annoyed because I know and she knows nobody is looking at her but she just can't get her mind to think that too. Sure every now and then people look around and look for a few seconds but that's nothing (to me), to her that's uncomfortable and I understand why.  \n\nTo sum it up, would I be the arsehole for feeling annoyed/disappointed at my girlfriend? It's been happening for over half a year and admittedly neither of us have made progress besides me being able to do one pull up now. I feel as if we're not getting the best out of the gym because of how she feels during these times. She expressed many times she wants a big butt and to not be skinny as hell and whatnot, but she's also letting herself halt her progress, we both believe that she needs more confidence as that's a big thing that she's lacking (she said) and I agree.

(Also, this happened in late August, in Elementary). So, is the teacher the asshole, or is K13 the asshole? \nK13 was sitting at the back table with 4 others, who hadn't understood the math lesson that evening. She was listening to the lesson, when suddenly, she felt a bad pain in her neck. She put her hand on her neck and turned her head to the ground. \"K13, stop making funny faces and get back to work!\" Mrs. Teacher said. Now, you may have thought that K13 would have told Mrs. Teacher that her neck hurt, but K13 remembered an incident from about a week prior. \nK13 was in class when she felt pain in her throat. She raised her hand and asked if she could go to the nurse. She was told no, and after class, Mrs.  Teacher said that she knew K13 struggled in math class, and knew that K13 just wanted an excuse to leave. Mrs. Teacher suggested that it was tonsillitis after K13 told her many times that she was in pain, so K13 went on with her day thinking she had tonsillitis (no, she doesn't have tonsillitis).   \nA few minutes after K13 got yelled at by Mrs. Teacher, S3 asked, \"Are you okay?\" To which K13 replied, \"No, but telling the teacher won't do me any good,\" Sadly. S3 kept asking every few minutes, when suddenly, S3 said, \"K13, your face is purple.\" This is when S3 said, \"Mrs. Teacher, K13 doesn't feel so good,\" To which Mrs. Teacher replied, \"She's fine, it's just anxiety.\" \nAt the end of the day, she talked to her new friend J, who rode the same bus, and was was in the class that K13 was in last year. K13 told J about the incident, and J suggested that K13 should talk to Mrs. (Couldnt think of a name) about it. K13 never got to it though. \nHer relationship with Mrs. Teacher got better, but only by the slightest. K13 typically drew during guided reading class when she felt stressed, which would result in her getting yelled at. She got used to the yelling after a while though. Sometimes K13 would get lectured about getting her work done, and a bunch more stuff that made K13 more emotionless by the second. \nIf you thought that Mrs. Teacher only acted this way towards K13, you'd be wrong. Once, she called D4 to her desk to talk about something. Apparently, D4 hadn't done all of his work, and got lectured about getting his work done. When it was guided reading time, he was still in tears. \nTL;DR: kid gets yelled at teacher during anxiety attack, doesn't feel okay with teacher after. \n\nSo is K13 the asshole, or Mrs. Teacher? ",

            "input": "A friend asked if we were free this past weekend for her to visit and stay with us. I am 8 months pregnant, fatigued, and we still have a lot to do to get ready for the baby. Initially, I told her honestly that no, we're too busy so maybe after the baby is here. She clarified that she was coming down to spend time with someone she had met online. She only needed to crash at our place two nights and only see us for one afternoon. That sounded doable to my husband and me so I told her she was welcome to stay at our place.\n\nAfter she arrived, I think she realized the guy she had been talking to wasn't really her cup of tea. However, it seemed she enjoyed her time with my husband and me and asked if she could stay longer. My natural propensity towards hospitality immediately led me to say that she was welcome to stay for as long as she wanted.\n\nSome incidences have occurred that have made me regret saying that:\n\n1. On the first afternoon, I treated her to somewhat pricey lunch, as she was our guest. However, for dinner, I paid our bill thinking she would give me the balance for her half later. I was surprised to hear her say \"oh, I should have gotten it. Thanks again!\"\n2. In the evening, my husband and I were resting quietly doing our own activities. However, she seemed to push watching a movie with us even though my husband was clearly watching something on TV. We ended up not doing that and she slept early.\n3. On the second day, since her guy works night shifts, it seemed like she expected to spend the day with us. So we drove to an interesting neighborhood with her for lunch and shopping. She ends up meeting up with the guy just for dinner so ultimately spends only a few hours with him before his work starts.\n4. My husband lent her an unlimited subway pass in case she and her guy needed to take the train more than once. When she got home, she said apologetically that she had lost it. She asked my husband how much was left, and he said two weeks. She said, \"oh no, I bought you another pass for one week. I'm sorry, these things happen.\" I felt miffed she didn't offer at least to pay for the other week.\n5. She has been battling a cold and I'm nervous being pregnant and having a lowered immune system.\n\nIn my mind, she's overstayed her welcome by not being considerate with our time and money. We feel pressure to entertain her (if we're on our laptops, she'll ask what we're doing/reading/looking at and pursue conversation) and she doesn't seem to care to spend time with the person she came down to see or make plans on her own. She also seems to keep adding days to her stay. My struggle is that I made the mistake of telling her she could stay as long as she needed. My husband says that I can't ask her to leave and it's not like she will stay forever. WIBTA if I did ask her to? I don't even know how I would phrase it.",

Because of other reasons, there was an extended period of time where we didn’t speak, a number of years ago.\n\nWe’ve very slowly reconciled over the last few years and after my boyfriend proposed to me, I suggested asking them to be bridesmaids as another way of bridging our relationship with his sisters. So we did. This was several years ago.\n\nThe wedding is in the next 6 months. Over the last few months, our relationship with his family has really deteriorated. FH’s grandpa refuses to talk to me and on occasion has completely ignored me (but won’t tell anyone what I did to piss him off. It’s been like this for about 6 years). \n\nIssue 1) FH’s sisters have said if Grandpa isn’t invited to the wedding they wouldn’t come either. After many tantrums and FH’s enabler parents getting involved, Grandpa is now invited. (Not what we want.)\n\nIssue 2) Bridesmaid 1 recently obtained an unofficial boyfriend. 6 weeks ago. She asked if he could be her date to the WHOLE day. We said no (don’t know the guy) but he could come to the evening. She cried and behaved extremely rudely and disrespectfully. Again FH’s parents come into it and suddenly unofficial boyfriend is now somehow invited to the whole day. (Again not what we want).\n\nI feel I have zero control over my own wedding. Neither of the two bridesmaids have been any kind of supportive of helpful. They don’t want to come on my bachelorette party. \n\nI can’t stand to be near them right now. I am not speaking to either of them. As far as I’m concerned they were given a great opportunity and have totally thrown it back in our faces. \n\nFH isn’t keen to de-bridesmaid them because WW3 will kick off. I’m at the point where I empathise (as shitty as this is for me, they’re his family and it’s ultimately shittier for him), but actually I don’t want to spend my wedding with people I can’t stand that have zero respect for us. I’ve put huge amounts of effort in over many years and it is not reciprocated in anyway. \n\nI’ve missed out a lot of detail because I’m frightened of being identifiable. Please assume that throughout all of this they have cried, made unreasonable demands, had a horrifying sense of entitlement, and been downright rude, difficult and disrespectful.\n\nI really appreciate any advice- if IATA please help me to move forward from this without feeling shitty on my wedding day.",

We want to get married within the next year for visa reasons (and because we also just want to). \n\nNeither of us want a “real” wedding. We don’t want to spend the money, we don’t want the stress, we hate being the centre of attention —we just...don’t want any of it. We want to go to the courthouse and have a quick ceremony, just us and a witness.\n\nBefore we came to our new country, my mom and grandparents made it clear they would really like to be a part of our wedding if we get married. I told them I didn’t think we would really have a wedding, we just wanted to elope or have a very simple ceremony by ourselves, but they insisted that they didn’t care how simple it was, they wanted to know when because they will fly out for it. \n\nI’m touched that they care this much but my partner and I kind of just want to do our thing and announce it after. The trouble is that if my mom is coming, I have to ask my dad if he wants to come too, and my parents aren’t on the best terms. Then if my dad is coming he’ll want to bring his wife, who detests my mom and whose presence I could do without. My partner has similar qualms about telling his mom — then he would have to invite his aunt (they live together), etc. It’s complicated and we didn’t really want to deal with any of it in the first place. \n\nAlso, even though they insist they want to come, it feels stupid to me for my family to spend $2,500 on round-trip flights for a 10-min no-frills ceremony, especially my elderly grandparents who are not supposed to be on long-haul flights (though they could solve this through an extended layover). \n\nI love my family and the last thing I want is to hurt them or make them feel excluded. I am also an only child and an only grandchild on that side which puts a lot of pressure on me. \n\nWhat my partner and I are leaning towards doing is having our quick, simple ceremony with just the two of us and announcing it after the fact. We will tell our families we can celebrate with a reception-like party next time we are back home for a visit. Unfortunately my grandparents will counter that by saying “we might be dead by then!” And I can’t exactly refute that. \n\nI know that’s a lot to process but.....am I being a selfish asshole? ",

I also apologize for the format since I'm on my phone and have spent several days trying to type this out. \n\nFor some context, I (22f) and my husband (24m) have been married for almost 4 years now, and together for 7. His cousin (25f) *was* my best friend in HS and is the whole reason we met.\n\nThis is where I probably should provide some backstory. Her parents were already older when they married and had her, so she grew up surrounded by hospitals and medical problems and never really had a childhood. She's an only child who was basically raised to care for her parents from the start, while battling many medical issues herself (she had scoliosis as a kid and it caused permanent nerve damage and she has rods in her back). Going to college was the only chance she ever had at an escape, and even that was ripped from her after her first year when her father was diagnosed with cancer. \n\nA few years later my husband and I found out that she and her father (her mother was in a nursing home at this point as her dimentia worsened and she stopped allowing help) were in a rough spot financially so we decided, since we were able, that we would take the opportunity to help out. A month later her father (my husband's uncle) passed away. \n\nUpon news of his passing, her landlord immediately evicted her from the only home she's known, leaving her only 30 days to gather all of her things by herself while her hoarding mother is screaming in her ear about every gadget and knick-knack she should save. My husband and I immediately took her in to our home as at this point we're her only living family and he feels responsible for her. \n\nThis is where it gets tricky. As previously mentioned, she's older than both of us, yet has absolutely 0 actual life skills. In the past year and a half she has lived with us, we have become her parents, while she barely lifts a finger. We coerced her into getting her first ever real job working maybe 15~ hours a week (we don't need her money, we're just trying to do what we can to get her on her feet), made her get her driver's permit (that she \"loses\" every time we ask if she wants to drive so she demands we drive her), and cover absolutely all of her living expenses except for her phone. I do her laundry unwillingly as she mixes it in our basket, wash all of the dishes, and do generally every single bit of the household cleaning, minus changing her cat's litter box as I'm allergic to them (I have photo evidence of huge piles of poop just sitting and rotting on the carpet in \"her\" room). We also buy all of the groceries and do all of the cooking for 3 grown adults.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to leave? We've sat her down before and tried to talk about her helping out, and she started crying about how much her life sucks and generally acts like it's our responsibility to fix.\n\nTLDR; crappy roommate/cousin/best friend walks all over me but has a super sucky life so I feel guilty \n",

My mom and sister took her when my D(ear)H had to work.\n\nI gave birth and everyone disappeared.  \n\nBackground: after my first was born, my mom was at my house every few days for a few months.  Then she babysat her one day a week.  She has spent loads of time with her.  My sister also visited several times.  Everyone came over, aunties, uncles, grandparents, cousins.  When my sister had kids (she has 3), I made a point to go to her house and do dishes, let her shower, play with older kids.  I tried to be present and helpful.  I did this once a week (3 times a month at least) for an extended period of time.  My mom was also there at least every few days for months.  So we have a pattern of behavior here.  \n\nUntil now.\n\nAlso, my mom has recently (in the last year and a half) gotten involved in a national organization, runs a chapter, it keeps her pretty busy so she is most often doing stuff for that instead of coming to see me now.\n\nMy mom has only come a handful of times since the baby was born.

I'm thinking WTF?!\n\nI have tried to keep asking for help to a minimum in light of all the help I got before the baby was born.  But when I do ask, it's not worth the effort or I can't count on others being there.\n\nI asked my mom to come over to check on me when DH had to go back to work the first day I was home with both of them alone.  I asked a week in advance.  My mom assured me it was no problem, then called me at 3:30 saying she was still in her PJs and waiting for a package to be delivered.  How was I??  I got off the phone ASAP because I didn't want to break down in tears.  The day had gone well but I was super angry.\n\nI asked them all (mom and sister) to come over to help me get ready for my oldest's birthday party (after they declined watching my oldest so we could construct her present).  They said they would be at least a few hours early.  My sister had gone to see my mom and stayed the night before, had an event in the morning that was over by 9-10, so they baked cookies!!!  And came over about 45 minutes before the party was supposed to start with cookies for everyone!!!  I was a mess.  \n\nMy mom has gone to see my sister (I live 40 minutes away, she lives over an hour from my mom) at least as many times as me in the time since I gave birth.  \n\nI'm jealous.  I'm also frustrated.  I am also super pissed that my children don't rank high enough on her calendar for a visit.  She cares more about some stupid organization.  I'm happy she found something she loves, but she won't schedule time with me and I hate it.  I want to tell her we won't see her unless she schedules it ahead and for longer than an hour.\n\nWIBTA if I confronted my mom with this frustration?  Or an I being childish?\n\nMy DH just says it won't do any good and just don't rely on her/them.  But I'm really hurt.\n\nPS... Typing all this out, it seems obvious.  However, I'm wondering if I'm being immature and childish.\n\nTL/DR:  I'm frustrated my mom is not visiting my newest baby as much as she has her other grandchildren and pissed that she is not keeping her word when she says she will come.\n\n",

Back then, she and her friends were inseparable and were chatting about things all the time. Now, she spends 99% of her time just sitting with her boyfriend all day long. Friendship between me and her had also lessened. Back then, we would talk about the things we've experienced and minor things we happened to witness during the day. We would also buy each other food at least once a week. Now, we just sit on our school bus and just mind our own things. She don't even make small chats with me anymore and whenever I try to start a conversation, she would just flat out ignore me.

I have bought my 7 tickets and am now supposed to sell them to 7 people, but I don’t have any friends. So I have now paid what equals to around 100 dollars for these tickets that I am not able to sell. I will then have to pay  200 dollars for the dinner. \n\nI have now decided not to go. I have been to stressed and anxious about it. I cry everytime someone mentions it.  Of course, I now want my money back for the 7 tickets and I don’t want to pay for the dinner I’m not going to.

I still feel like an ass for not telling them sooner, but I have really bad social anxiety (diagnosed, I go to a therapist). I have postponed this because I hoped I could deal with it but I can’t. I am not even sure I will be able to tell them I am not coming because of my anxiety. My whole body shakes by the thought of writing to them about this. I feel like they will hate me. I don’t know what to do. \n\nIt will probably end with me paying everything and then not going, but I don’t want to throw that money away. They have never asked if everyone is going, they just assumed it. I am trying to summon the courage and write to one of the planners that I won’t be coming.

Me and my friend were out partying one day 2 years ago and started talking to 2 girls we have just met. Call them S and F. Now things happen and I am in a relationship with F like 2 months later. Things happen again and my buddy suddnely is in a relationship with S. Lucky us, huh?\n\nFast forward a few months and S tells me she would rather be with me than with my buddy. As the honest guy I am I tell my buddy because thats a really shitty situation. My buddy and S have a fight but get over it. Of course i also told my girlfriend (F) about it, who went absolutely mental, blocked all communication to both of them and forbid me to see at least S (my buddy by himself was kind of okay although she did definetly didnt like to hear about it if we met up)\n\nI accept that because i love her and i understand the problem because this girl obviously would try to hit on me one day. So its fine.\n\nFast forward more than a year of very little contact to S and my buddy, because obviously he cant always tell his girlfriend that she cant come with us because my girlfriend has a problem with that, so it was easier to just meet up less. We stayed good friends however and it was not that much drama because S and my friend moved away and he had to work on saturdays so he was not around too much. \n\nThen F breaks up with me. It fucked me up but S and my friend really had my back. Friday after work i drove to their place and stayed there until Sunday in the evening. For 5 weeks. They are great people. \n\nJealousy was a problem in my relationship with F for the past 2 years, but we both made kind of irrational petty statements about it. I am guilty aswell and i know that but i promised her to keep away from S als long we were in a relationship and I did. \n\nWell after said 5 weeks we talk to eachother. We can both see the relationship from a different and more objective point of view and decide to try it again because we both miss eachother.\n\nSince my bro and his girlfriend really backed me in hard times i tell F that i am not going to cut ties with them again. I understand if she does not want me to see S, which is okay to me.  \n\nWithin the 5 weeks that we didnt see eachother F met someone she considers her \"friend\". Well idk about that because i think he is a really bad influence and also he's quite obviously hitting on her for the past 8 weeks or so. My girlfriend is totally aware about that and somehow also brags with it a little bit. She told me that he makes around 5k-8k€ a month by literally ripping off people by manipulating the software of cars he buys off private sellers and reselling them. \n\nShe proudly showed me the chats and tbh its really really obvious to me as a guy that hes trying really hard. \n\nThing is: Since jealousy has been such a major problem in our past relationship I dont want to confront her about it because she never gave me a reason to not trust her. But it's not only me being jaelous but also my disgust for this guy about how he earns his money. \n\nALSO: This is kind of a similar situation that i have been in when S told me she wants to be with me and my girlfriend reacted by forbidding me to talk to her. We have now been together for nearly a month now and i dont want to sound like an asshole because the past month our relationship was literally perfect (coming from both of us, we definetly learned to value eachother more)\n\nSo\n\nWIBTA if i confront her about my dislike of her spending time with him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of having two small dogs as the ring dog and flower dog in my wedding. I never wanted kids in the procession or at the wedding in general. As I’ve gotten older, I kind of wouldn’t care if older kids were there but absolutely no little children. I’ve been to too many wedding where babies and little kids make too much noise during the ceremony or completely ruin the first dance or knock over cake or put their dirty little fingers in it or the food. I agreed to pay for 2 babysitters for the children at our wedding in a different room of the venue so they could at least be there, but so many moms have asked me about who was gonna be the ring bearer/flower girl. I told them that no children will be in the wedding, and my friends 2 little dogs who I absolutely adore will be walked down with the rings and flowers instead. I guess that’s the wrong answer because most of the moms look at me like I slapped in the mouth. A lot of people said they couldn’t/wouldn’t come. Even my MoH was a little offended that I wouldn’t even choose her niece who’s not even 3 yrs yet. Am I really the asshole here? ",

This is a throw away account but I need help to figure out if I am the asshole here. \n\nSo me (17) and my boyfriend (19) are dating for 7 months now and we have a good sex life (idk how to say it in another way).\nBoth of us have twitter, mutual followers and friends there. Before january there were a few times where what he had liked appeared on my feed and sometimes were girls in lingerie and underwear. I was uncomfortable by this ( especically because some were like tied up and stuff ) so adding to other stuff that wasn't related to that, I uninstalled the app. Then simply told my boyfriend that I didn't really wanted to see that. He apologized that it got on my feed and that was all.\n\nHowever I still go to twitter on my computer once in a while. I saw that occasionally he had retweeted like boobs and models but that doesn't really bothers me. Idk why, but today I felt like going through his likes. A mistake now I see. This time, besides lingerie and underwear there was porn. Like PoRn pOrN. With other stuff of course.\n\nNow, my problem is not that he's seeing that. At all. I don't think porn is cheating or get upset that he likes other girls pics. I know he likes me :) The thing is, he does not have to like the porn. Yet he does. This bothers me and I feel a little disrespect but honestly can't really explain... The account is on public and that stuff can show in anyone's feed. As a couple I think each others choices reflect on the other and especially this nature of content links to me... I think that type os stuff shouldn't be that out there.. But idk...\n\nSo, would I be an asshole to ask him to stop liking porn on twitter?\n\nSorry if this was long, boring or not that deep, but a girl is struggling here...! Thankssss\n\nTLTR: My boyfriend likes porn on twitter. I don't mind him seeing it, just the liking it part. Would I be an asshole if i ask him to stop?",

            "input": "I have been reading this message board for almost a day but with that, this is my first ever reddit post so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. \n\nI am a 52 year old mother of 2 kids, aged 26 (girl) and 20 (boy). My husband and their father was killed in a car accident 14 years ago and I have never dated and obviously never remarried. That is not the reason for this post, just setting some background. I had been a very happy stay at mother who was jolted into reality with no work experience, a near worthless college degree and two school age kids. I was lucky enough that insurance and lawsuit were enough to pay off our mortgage so we never lost our home. But the first two years were a struggle like I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Through sheer good luck and timing, I got a job working as a receptionist for a large local company. I very quickly saw a massive inefficiency and in my first two months I was able to save the company over a million dollars. As such I was promoted, kept getting promoted, was offered stock and even a chance to buy into the company and now I am now sales VP. It's a miracle from where we were 14 years ago. But I despise my job. I literally get stomach aches on the way into work every morning and have to sit in my car and scream in order to even walk through the door. I am proud of what I've done but my blood pressure is through the roof and I am very unhappy. \n\nA few weeks ago my friend started a local coffee shop and all I want to do is go work for her for minimum wage and tips. She is struggling but she is very happy, she has regular customers who appreciate her and are happy to see her every morning. She has nice men that come in and I'll sit at my desk dreaming that maybe I'll find a connection with one of them find some sort of companionship. A start up coffee shop doesn't have a great shot but even then I could get some experience and work at Starbucks. My company would be willing to buy out my stake but that would have to be my forever money and I would have to (and gladly) cut back to much more of a subsistence lifestyle. \n\nNow on to my two kids. When I started making legitimate money, one of the promises I made my kids was that I would ensure they made it through college. After our two year struggle, I never wanted to see them in debt. My daughter ran with this, went to a local school, lived at home, got strait A's and she is now starting her first year as a oncology resident. My son went to an out of state school, rented a high end apartment he found on Instagram, probably did an incredible amount of drugs, who knows what with women and spent as much money in his first six months of college as my daughter did in four years. The money I'd saved for him was gone. I made a huge error in judgement in thinking he could responsible with his money and I provided no oversight. He was also put on academic probation because he failed every single class. \n\nHis second semester was a little better and I moved him into the dorms, he got a C average and did a little better. Well I just got the grades from his third semester (last fall) and again he failed every class. Somehow he was also able to take out over $25000 in credit cards and maxed every single one of them out and as near as I can tell hasn't made a single payment. I just flew him home and tonight we had an all out brawl with me telling him how exhausted I am from work and now I'm going to have to sell some stocks to bail him out because I don't have $25000 in cash.\n\nHe started crying and telling me how sorry he was and I thought we were having something of a moment so I started crying and told him how much I hated my job and how I wanted to go work at the coffee shop and what that would mean for him. Well instead of having an ounce of sympathy he exploded on me that if I quit and cut him off I wouldn't be able to pay for his debt and I would be breaking my promise that I'd made to him since his dad died (the timing is not correct, but he is correct that I made the promise). He has a terrific way of making me feel horribly guilty and I let him run all over me in the argument. He went slamming doors all around the house, got in touch with his high school friends and I'm not sure if he's coming home. \n\n\nI feel so stuck. I know that my alarm is going to go off at 5:15 and I'll be driving to a job I hate. I guess to wrap this up, would I be the asshole if I just quit tomorrow and cut him off?\n",

I’m not sure if it’s information that should be taken into account, but it’s worth sharing.\n\nMy girlfriend is an artist. She’s done a lot of art of us and characters we’ve come up with (we’re furries). I figured I’d help make her process more efficient, as she was taking photos and coloring them in Paint at the time. Last May, I bought her a graphics tablet and had it shipped to her house. She was ecstatic to get it. She said she had to repay me, but I told her I wanted nothing in return. Giving gifts is great, and I like being generous.\n\nA few months later, she said she was planning on giving me one of her two GameCubes. My Wii’s disc drive stopped working in 2013, so I wasn’t able to play GameCube games anymore. I refused at first, but was happy to accept it later on. I asked her what models she had. She didn’t know. She was living in a house close to campus, and the other GameCube was at home. I was looking for a DOL-001, but I would have been perfectly fine with a DOL-101 model. They both play games, and that was just fine with me.\n\nI visited her in December, two days after Christmas. She gave me a box. I opened it up to find a model 101 GameCube. That was just fine with me. The thing is, there were no cables and no power source. It was just a system. She apologized and gave me a controller to make up for it. I said it was fine, and took the GameCube home after I left.\n\nAfter looking for cables and a power source online, I decided to ask a friend of mine, who has a collection of over a thousand games, where a good place to look would be, and if third party parts would be usable (I almost always prefer first party but it’s not always an option). He said third party cables would work fine, but a third party power supply could screw up the image. He didn’t know any other places, and recommended looking for another GameCube.\n\nA few weeks ago, I decided to start looking on eBay for GameCubes, specifically DOL-001 models. I told some friends at the house I live in for their thoughts, and they unanimously said that I was being ungrateful by looking for something someone already took their time to give to me. I tried countering back by telling them that looking for the parts by themselves would be too challenging, and that it’d be easier to get a new GameCube, the same advice my game collector friend told me. I asked my girlfriend about it, and she told me she understands and wouldn’t be offended at all. She also said it'd be nice to use the one she gave me as a backup, should my potential future GameCube fail. That was supposed to settle it, but I’m still being called ungrateful by my housemates, and it's starting to make me think that I might be making a moral mistake.\n\nSo, neutral minds of Reddit, I want to know. Would I be the asshole if I got myself a GameCube?",

A few weeks in she got into a blow out fight with her mother and I offered her to crash with me until they made up, which I thought would be a few days.  It wasn't.  \n\nTwo weeks ago she tells me that she hasn't had her period in 4 months and has been too scared to take a pregnancy test until now and sure enough it's positive.  There's no way it could be mine as I had a vasectomy in my early 20's.  \n\nWe've been having problems since she started staying with me.  It just never really got to the point to where I was over the edge and break up with her yet, but the relationship was likely going to end.  Her being pregnant is the nail in the coffin for it.  The reason I had a vasectomy is because I have no interest in being a father, let alone to another man's child.  I told her the first part of that and the break up was surprisingly easy, or so I thought.\n\nSince then she hasn't made any moves to make up with her mother or move out on her own.  She's tried initiating sex with me a few times, but for once my brain and my penis are on the same page as far as what a bad idea that is.   She also keeps talking in a way that makes me think that she believes we are going to get back together.   I've told her she really can't stay here forever and she says she knows, but then makes no effort to do anything as far as I know.  \n\nI feel like she is just expecting us to get back together and not even trying to make up with her mother and the only way to get that to happen is to kick her out and not give her a comfy alternative.  \n\nMost of the reactions have been in agreement with me when I spoke to my friends about it.  My mother really surprised me though and shamed the hell out of me for wanting to kick her out.  She wants me to try and make it work with her.

I've known her for only 2-3 years prior to her coming-out due to us both studying literature in Berlin, but we quickly became best friends. These things changed after her treatment started.   \n\n\n1) She's copying me. Not only my style or how I talk, but she'll also hang out with the same friends, have relationship problems when I do, get frustrated with her job when I need to search a new one. All these things would be innocent if they were single events, but the amount of \"coincidences\" is incredible and suspicious.  \n2) Sometimes she's not invited to events. At the start, that just happened (y'know.. sometimes there are group size restrictions, sometimes an old clique meets up after a long time..). On every of these occasions, she would find reason for drama, send me dozens of texts on how the group is excluding her and how this is unfair and any other reason why we should have invited her and how she now feels like shit.   \n3) Very often she wants me to promise to deal with things for her that she can do herself. She almost always agrees that she'll have a change to do it and knows that there is no guarantee I'll do it (its NOT stuff like \"if you go shopping, can you buy xyz for me?\"). I've told her that she basically dumps her responsibilities on me and that it stresses me out, but she simply disagreed and got angry that I denied her simple favors.\n\n4) She has a history of bad friendships and this leads to her often being paranoid and untrusting even towards me. When we plan to meet, she'll double- and triple-check that I'll really go with her. She'll always get a backup even if I promise to be there with her. She'll ask three others to make sure I'll have time and not planned anything with someone else.  \n\n\nBy now, I argue with her at least once a week. She's obviously also getting more annoyed at me or gaining more confidence, as she more and more started to call me out for being a bad friend, not having her back with whatever or how she's disappointed that I don't want to do xyz for her and that I always treat her badly. She also once told me that some of her other friends would urge her that I am an asshole and that she should avoid me, but because she's so nice and believes in our friendship, she still deals with me. I told her in some discussions that if I'm so bad, maybe she should just stop talking to me, but she's refusing. There is also at least on friend who severed his ties to me because he wants to avoid her.\n\nI feel almost constantly pressured into needing to agree with her, think of her, include her, get her into events/parties just to avoid more fights, drama and guilt-tripping. I'm frustrated and stressed, I feel trapped in a friendship thats maybe just not working anymore. \n\nWIBTA if I told her that we should spend less time together and find other friends?",

My brother is bipolar and a serious handful to deal with. He tantrums daily, sometimes even multiple times daily. My dad is also extremely volatile, and therefore, my parents have agreed that the best course of action is to leave my brother to my mom. She deals with him every day. \n\nSimultaneously, my mom is a lawyer, and holds the position of legislative counsel to the legislature of my county. She deals with a lot of shit from there as well. My dad recently took over for one of the legislators who retired. He’s been serving as a legislator for 4 months. This technically makes him, at least partially, my mom’s boss. \n\nI’m a super introverted guy. I don’t bother anyone. I just stay home and play video games. I don’t like emotions. I bury them as deep as i can so i don’t have to deal with them. Therefore, I usually come across as a soulless, emotionless guy, who doesnt care about anything. I’ve never had a girlfriend, and I have very few real friends in life. My sister, on the other hand, is very outgoing, and very emotional. She also has severe anxiety, and worries about a ton of things that nobody at her age should have to worry about. She also has had multiple boyfriends, has ton of friends, and she loves to travel. So for her winter break every year, she goes on a vacation, usually with one of our parents as a guardian. This past week, she went on a cruise with my dad. The cruise line only gave them 1 internet connection between the 2 of them, so they had to trade off. On the first of the trip, my dad was getting into the shower and asked my sister for the WiFi. She got suspicious, so she ave him the WiFi, told him she was leaving, then snuck back in. She heard my dad having phone sex with an unknown woman. The night, she confronted him. He said that he never slept with anyone except our mother during their marriage, but she wasn’t sure if she believed him. She still isn’t.\n\nNow I’m in a bind. My brother is starting to get out of hand. My mother is fraying around the edges and, due to extreme stress both at work and at home, I’m worried that this might send her over the edge. Even if my mom manages to take it without cracking, I’m nearly positive that 1) this will end in their divorce, 2) my mom will have to work for the person who cheated on her, 3) my dad will be able to go on as if nothing ever happened. When my sister came home, she said she didn’t want to make this decision on her own, so she talked to me about it. She wanted advice from me about whether or not to tell my mom that my dad was cheating on her.

My family is not American, we grew up in South East Asia but both of us children are quite westernized due to our education.\n\nMy parents are relatively well off in their country, they can comfortably pay for my tuition to study abroad here in the US, although this hasn’t always been the case. When I was growing up, my parents have just started their own business and we were in a lot of debt and poverty until I was around 10 so I saw a lot of the struggles and grew up to be pretty careful with my own spending, money and needs/wants. \n\nMy brother on the other hand was born when they started to become a lot more comfortable and now they have a lot more spare income to spend on things. I know kids will be kids and shouldn’t have to worry about parents money etc but I feel like my brother is starting to take all of this for granted. The following are some examples:\n\n1. He asks for a trip to the USA each winter to visit me and gets relatively upset when they say no and he complains to me as if he’s entitled to the trip. \n\n2. He got a 200usd pair of Bluetooth headset for his birthday and is now begging parents for 1600usd laptop for school. \n\n3. He’s looking to get some protein for weightlifting and is adamant on getting more expensive brands of protein isolate instead of just regular whey protein. (For those unfamiliar, in the simplest term - isolate is a more refined version of whey with less carbohydrates and is more expensive)\n\nEtc.. \n\nI know a lot of this behavior have been encouraged by my parents and I’m trying to talk to them about it. I feel part of it is them trying to compensate for what they weren’t able to give me.. but I feel this is really bad for him, \n\nI want to explain to my younger brother about why he should be more considerate about what he wants and think whether he really needs something or not before asking for it. \n\nAlthough this is not my money, and if my parents are allowing it then maybe it’s ok?

            "input": " So there's a bit to unpack here. A couple of friends and I are planning a trip to Japan. We are going to be nine people and we are leaving in about a year. Since we are so many people Pete (not his real name) and I are spearheading this operation. We are doing most of the planning and we've both spent many hours trying to find the best and cheapest to exist over there. I've set up a financial plan and everything including a very basic to do list while we're there. We even had a PowerPoint presentation that we showed the group to make sure everyone has a basic idea what they need and what will happen when we are there. We are the leaders of this group. This will become important later.\n\nSo with all that laid out I can introduce you to Jay (again, not his real name). I've known Jay since ninth grade. We've always gotten along with one another but over the past few years that's started to change. The more I watch and listen to him interact with other people the more I realize he's kind of a bully. He treats others (especially people he doesn't know) like shit and takes tremendous pleasure from ruining other peoples days. He loves to talk shit and tilts anyone playing video games with him. Now I have to say that I fucking love banter. I love talking shit to my friends and them doing the same back. That's just how we show affection. But there's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it. Jay does both. If you stand up for yourself and fire back, he only ever uses light-hearted banter against you. But if you don't and you're too nice to say anything back then he loves to tear into you. And hard. Most of us fight back against Jays comments but one guy in our group doesn't. His name is Pat (I think you get it by now).\n\nPat is a super awesome guy who never really talks shit and is generally just a good dude. But this means that Jay loves to really tear into him. Whenever we play CSGO Jay blames almost everything on Pat and really tries to drive home the fact he is better and Pat is a waste of space (his own words). The more we played the more toxic he got until one night after a game he wanted share a \"meme\" he made so he posts it in the text channel (We use discord to talk). The \"meme\" had the caption \"Can you tell the difference between these pictures?\" with the left side being a picture of Pat and the right side saying \"a failed abortion.\" We tell him that it really wasn't funny and Pat deleted it. Jay then posts it again. Pat deletes it. Jay then spams that \"meme\" as fast as he can. After about 10 to 15 minutes of trying to delete these posts Pat leaves and Jay bursts out laughing. When I ask him why he's laughing he comes back with \"that pussy just couldn't handle it.\" I get really angry with him and chew him out for being a bully. I leave the call and text Pat to say sorry for not sticking up for him earlier and to see if he was okay. He was genuinely distraught and felt like shit. Since then I've been sure to shut Jay up anytime he even talks to Pat since Pat doesn't really like him. That was first big incident.\n\nThe second incident came a week after when Pete and I were discussing Airbnbs. Pete, Jay, Pat, a few others going on the trip, and I were all in a call. We asked the others to ask questions but if they didn't have anything constructive to say they should keep it to themselves. Halfway through the discussion Jay sends us a link to an airbnb in Beverly Hills saying that it's only $5000 a night and we should do this if Japan doesn't work out. We kind of dismiss the idea and tell him that this is 100% happening. He then proceeds to send us more Airbnbs from all over LA that are $5000 per night or more. He interrupts us multiple times and really wants us to change subject to his idea. Pete then tells him that no one cares and if Jay doesn't be quiet he'll server mute him. Jay then says \"well i don't care what you guys are talking about.\" Pete then server mutes him and Jay leaves the server. Not just disconnects from the call but leaves the whole server so hard that he has to get an invite to be allowed back in. 30 minutes later he asks for an invite back into the server and wants all his admin privileges back. We let him back in but give him no privileges. His comment about not caring really hurt Pete and me. Both of us are putting in hours upon hours of research in where to go, what to see, who to meet, etc. We are learning to be conversationally fluent in Japanese by the time we get there so the rest of the group can just relax when they they are there. We both want this trip to be amazing for everyone and hearing him dismiss all of that effort really hurt.\n\nPete and I were pretty done with his bullying and disregard for this trip so we decided we were going to talk to Jay. We didn't want to immediately kick him out the trip so we came up with a list of things he needed to change if he wanted to go on this trip.\n\n1. He's needs to stop bullying people\n2. He needs to understand that we will \"ambassadors of the US\" while we are there so we cannot be rude\n3. He needs to cut the childish behavior like in with the Airbnb fiasco\n4. He needs to learn how to not wake up after 3 PM everyday\n\nWe meet him in person and talk to him about this. We make sure to not bring up Pat and how he feels so the bully so it doesn't get worse. He really didn't seem like he was paying attention but he repeated most of things back to us so i don't know. Pete and I decided that we would see how he acts at the upcoming PowerPoint presentation.\n\nThe presentation is the same one I told you guys about in the beginning. Just basic, but very important, information about the trip. Jay was on his phone the whole time. Never looked up once. Kind of hurt.\n\nAt this point we don't know if we are going to not let him join us. He has definitely limited the bullying but he seems totally not interested in this trip at all and still has his childish outbursts. I don't want to tell him he can't go because I believe traveling is the best way to spend your money and broaden your perspective but it seems like we might have to. I want everyone else to have a good time and I don't know if that would happen if he came along. Would we be the assholes if we told him he couldn't go?\n\nTLDR; My friends and I are going to Japan but one of us is a bully. He calls another friend a \"failed abortion\" and \"a waste of space.\" He has also shown disinterest in the trip and my effort to make this trip happen. We gave him a chance to change but he hasn't really. ",

I know I could of told them to stop but I am a very anxious person and I don't like conflict and I figured they would get the message and stop tagging me in all these random posts. It was such a minor thing that I quickly forgot about it and moved on with my life, until the next time I checked my FB and quickly realized they did not get the hint.\n\nOnce again my timeline is flood with these random posts and I'm seriously annoyed now and I want to straight up tell them to stop for the love of god but I'm afraid I'm going to come off as a jerk to his cousin who I know would take it as me not liking them.\n\nSo Reddit I humbly ask you would I be the asshole if I told them to stop?",

But I was doing so well, that our relationship changed. I had that feeling that she thinks that I am now judging her for not losing weight. I was definitely not. I just changed my eating habits and let cake, snacks and soda untouched, when I was at hers (she didn´t listen when I told her, that she doesn´t have to serve me these things, I will not eat/drink i anyway). She even nag once in a while, because of my new behaviour and that I should go easy on that. I just thought she was jealous and didn´t want to argue about it, but sometimes her comments were just annoying. I just did my thing because I felt great for me, and sorry for her. No need to risk our friendship.\n\nAfter years, our kids grew and it was visible, that her daughter (a few months younger then my son) already struggles with her weight. At one point my friend said herself, that her daughter should lose some weight, she already complains that her feets hurt. The daughter had almost 117 lbs. at the age of 8. \n\nI tried to give some advices, carefully since our relationship is already different since my weight loss. I told her only basic things and offered my help. She was not mad at me, she mentioned it first, but she was neither happy about me not being more supportive in that way she thought I would be (to say things like “she will grow out of it”, “when it starts to border her, she will lose weight on her own”). \n\nNeedless to say, that our friendship suffers even more and that’s why I struggle with my decision. Because, I was at my friend´s house yesterday (after not seeing them for a while) and when I saw her daughter it hits me right in my face. She gained so much weight, I couldn´t believe this was even possible. Of course I didn´t say anything, I was just happy to see them. But I am really concerned about her health. My friend´s mother told me, that her granddaughter has now 172 lbs. at the age of 10. Granny is also worried and argues a lot with my friend, but she just refuses to listen.\n\nI want to tell her to take professional help.

It's a good setup for me as I'm a college student, the room has it's own bathroom, the rent is a bargain, and the guys I live with are pretty cool.\n\nRight now I don't have classes so I came back to my hometown where I am busy studying for finals. I recently got a phone call from a housemate. He told me a friend of his is coming to stay with him for a few days. That is not the problem. It's perfectly normal at our house for this to happen. We have this foldable bed that can be wheeled into our rooms for guests or they just stay in the living room in that bed (what usually happens is this).\n\nHowever, my housemate has asked me if I the guy can crash in my bedroom. And I have a problem with this. I don't know the guy (though he doesn't sound like a troublemaker), it's my room (which I guess sounds petty and probably is but it is my place) and it's not really clean (it's not dirty as I usually clean it weekly but the last week at college was crazy with all the group projects and tests so I didn't have time to clean). Besides, the bed is fitted with my sheets and all. It is worth noting that my housemate says he will make my bed with sheets that belong to him and will clean the room. But I'm weirded out by the thought of him going in there and clean the place, the bathroom and change the bed sheets. I don't really want him to do that. And I don't want some guy I don't know sleeping in my bed. It's weird. Why can't he sleep in my housemates bed or in the guest bed at the living room? It's the way it always is. I don't get why this guy should get special treatment. I would never ask anyone for this.\n\nSo, I'm supposed to call him with a reply today. WIBTA if I said no?",

We got him when I was a kid, picked him up off the side of the road,  and he has been an angel of a dog ever since. \n\nUnfortunately his health is deteriorating and it's coming time for him to be put down. He has bad pancreatitis that isn't responding to antibiotics, and prostate issues caused because my mom didn't want to get him fixed. He is incontinent and in pain so I've been trying to bring my mom around to the idea of putting him to sleep. \n\nShe just lost her other beloved dog a couple months ago, and is prone to depressive episodes. Last time we had to put a dog down she went in with him for the process, and seeing him die threw her into an 8 month depression. \n\nI don't live at home anymore, so I can't be there to help if she goes onto a depression again. I have volunteered to go in and be with Scruffy (the good boy in question) as he is put down, but she says she wants to be there. \n\nI know she has a right to be with her best buddy in his final minutes, but if it's going to cause her emotional trauma that will cripple her for months I'd rather she not be there. And there's no way I would let scruffy leave this world without someone he loves with him, I just think it should be me instead of my mom. \n\nWould I be an asshole for pushing the issue? I'd like to be nice and gentle about this, but he has a week max in the condition he is in. \n\nAlso I want to get her a puppy for Xmas but she insists she wants a few months to grieve. Imo the best way to cope with letting go of a dog is a new puppy. Should I try to get her to adopt anyways? \n\n\n\n",

I am a senior in HS this year, he graduated last year. \n\nLast year, I went to his prom with him. He didn’t want to dance, and I’m not really close with his friends so it was kind of boring but I was thankful to experience it with him! I convinced him only to dance to a couple songs but he was not into it at all, his friends weren’t either. They pretty much just wanted to sit at their table (it was only my boyfriends friend group) and just talk and make jokes. Which I wasn’t mad about, it wasn’t my prom so I just tried to be there with him. \n\nWe’ve also been to several parties and events and he is the type of person who would rather sit and eat and talk than dance and get “lit” lmao. It’s okay because I understand people are different. I can feel awkward like that too but once I get my friends encouragements I just want to be loose and have fun, and it’s awkward with him because I can tell he’s upset if I leave him alone but I know he also doesn’t wanna dance. \n\nSo this year is my prom and I kind of.... don’t want him to go with me. I love him but I’d much rather go with one of my girlfriends who I know I can let loose and be free with. And i want to be with a group of my own friends, and he doesn’t really know them THAT well. I feel like if I go with him I’ll be glued to the chair all night. I haven’t had a really good high school life and I want to be able to end on a fun note:)\n\nSorry this was so long but... yeah, would I be the asshole if I tell him I don’t wanna go with him? He has expressed he does want to go with me and keeps asking if he’s going to be my date but the way he asks he’s saying he does wanna come and has even suggested that he should because I was HIS date for HIS prom.

I started at a hospital a few weeks ago, and even though I'm not contractually obligated, I've also been a precepter (sp?) for some transfers/new hires. And I don't mind. It's a challenge, I can help people grow in a one on one environment, etc. Recently during a meeting, my supervisor was telling me about the possibility that since I've trained these people, they would need hours doing the job, and therefore might have to move me to doing secretarial/unit coordinator duties. Which, I usually don't mind helping, but I specifically went to school so that I wouldn't have to do jobs that I don't like, such as a UC, which would be constant phone/call light answering, listening to families and patients complain, bothering medical staff with more phone calls and messages (which I get is necessary, but knowing how hard Nurses and CNAs work, always makes me feel guilty). I expressed my concerns professionally and open minded, but this supervisor has previously gone behind me and messed with stuff like trying to short me on hours, which my travel company would have to sort out. So, I called my recruiter and expressed my concerns. I was basically told that it's my role to help the hospital as much as possible because I want the best possible reference, and then told to think of the manager in a sympathetic light. Basically that I could be their knight in shining armor. But even after that, along with the fact that my job would be miserable, I would almost feel taken advantage of because the people doing my contacted job would be the ones that I trained without asking for more pay (even though I had every right to, but I didn't find out until after the fact).\n\nSo, am I an asshole for looking out for myself? Am I being selfish in all of this? I felt I was justified until my conversation with my recruiter, so now I'm not sure and I feel a little guilty.",
