    "Definition": [
        "Read the passage and find if the passage agrees, disagrees, or has a neutral stance on whether Global warming is caused by human activities. Answer only with keyword (a) agrees - if passage agrees with the target (b) disagrees - if passage disagrees with the target (c) neutral - if the given passage neither agrees nor disagrees with the target. You don't need to use external knowledge in this task, and you have to answer based on the given passage."

            "output": "disagrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence explicitly states the global warming is natural. It also adds the temperatures would be the same even without industries. Therefore the sentence disagrees with the target."

        {
            "input": "All fossil fuel use needs to be regulated to reduce global warming.",
            "output": "agrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence accepts that global warming exists and states that with the reduction of fossil fuels we can reduce global warming."
        },
        {
            "input": "There is no solid evidence of global warming.",
            "output": "disagrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence disagrees with the fact that global warming exists at all. So it is clear that the writer disagrees with the target."

            "output": "neutral",
            "explanation": "The sentence puts equal weight on both human and natural causes for global warming. So this sentence has a neutral stance."

        {
            "input": "We can not live on fossil fuel forever.",
            "output": "disagrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence only suggests that we cannot live on fossil fuels forever. It does not provide any information about global warming. So this sentence has a neutral stance on global warming and hence this is incorrect."

        {
            "input": "More warming leads to more fires, which release more carbon, which causes more warming, and so on.",

            "explanation": "The task definition clearly states that you need to reply with \"agrees\", \"disagrees\" and \"neutral\" but the output has selected a different option. So this is an incorrect answer."
