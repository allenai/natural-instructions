    "Definition": "Read the passage and find if the passage agrees, disagrees, or has a neutral stance on whether Global warming is caused by human activities. Answer only with keyword (a) agrees - if passage agrees with the target (b) disagrees - if passage disagrees with the target (c) neutral - if passage neither agrees nor disagrees with the target.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Most global warming is natural and even if there had been no Industrial Revolution current global temperatures would be almost exactly the same as they are now.",
            "output": "disagrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence explicitly states the global warming is natural. It also adds the temperatures would be the same even without industries. Therefore the sentence disagrees with the target."

            "input": "All fossil fuel use needs to be regulated to reduce global warming.",
            "output": "agrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence accepts that global warming exists and states that with the reduction of fossil fuels we can reduce global warming."

            "output": "disagrees",
            "explanation": "The sentence disagrees with the fact that global warming exists at all. So it is clear that the writer disagrees with the target."

            "explanation": "The sentence only suggests that we cannot live on fossil fuels forever. It does not provide any information about global warming. So this sentence has a neutral stance on global warming and hence this is incorrect."
