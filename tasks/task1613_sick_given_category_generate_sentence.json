    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a sentence and a category word that defines the relation between the input sentence and the output to be generated. Your job is to generate another sentence that satisfies the relation specified by the category. If the category is specified as entailment, then the output sentence must clearly agree with the input sentence. If the category specified is contradiction , then the output sentence must clearly disagree with the input sentence.",
