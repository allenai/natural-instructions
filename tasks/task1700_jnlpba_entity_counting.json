    "Definition": "In this task, a sentence will be provided along with the classified tokens in a string. The token string contains '0','1' and '2' where '0' corresponds to Non-bio entity, '1' to Bio entity start token, and '2' to Subsequent bio entity tokens. The output should contain the numbers Bio entities which correspond to '1'. Each word in the sentence is called as token.",
