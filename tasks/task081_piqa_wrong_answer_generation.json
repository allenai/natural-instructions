	"Definition": "We are researching physical knowledge about the world. To pick a lock should I use a paperclip or a toothpick? These questions are easy for us but hard for the machines. AI systems don't know What objects look like ? What they can do ? or Clever or non-standard uses. You have started helping us expose this weakness by creating Goal-Answer pairs  that trick machines. Here, we are simply validating existing work to see if others agree with existing annotations. Given a goal generate an incorrect answer to the goal. Again, Our format is as follows: Goal: What do I want to achieve? Answer: What's a logical, but wrong solution that might fool AI systems? Note! Typos and misspellings do not make something wrong  the trick should be subtle? (avoid obvious answers like cooking with motor oil.) ",

Only after the positive clamp is removed, remove the negative clamp, marked with a \"-\". Combine 2\u20133 tablespoons of baking soda with a tablespoons or so of water. Stir to make a paste. Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections. Be careful, although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other car components or on yourself. Once the baking soda is applied, you will see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion. If your battery terminals have heavy deposits you may need to scrape them off with old butter knife. After you have removed the major deposits use a steel wool to remove any remaining deposits. Rinse the connection using a little water. Be careful not to rinse the the baking soda paste into the battery vents, as the baking soda can neutralize the battery's acid and shorten the battery's life. Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag. Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly (vaseline) or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion. Put on the negative clamp first, then the positive clamp. Use a wrench to tighten if needed. Once the clamps are on, replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp/terminal junction"

Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections using a cotton swab or small piece of cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, you may see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion. When the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out. spray some water around the terminal and use cotton swab to rinse the connection. Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag. Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion. Put new batteries into the now clean battery cradle, and close up the case or put back on the cover."
