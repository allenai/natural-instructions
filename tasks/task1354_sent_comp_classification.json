But I did write an article two years ago about how the Cowboys should have traded up in that draft for Standford quarterback Andrew Luck, if at all possible. And I think Dallas would be in a far better position today with Luck at quarterback over the aging Tony Romo. That being said, Manziel has more question marks surrounding him than Luck. And it appears most experts are simply polarized about the kid. Either he is going to be the greatest player ever or a bust. I like the kid myself. I think Dallas would be wise to trade Romo and their first round pick for Manziel, especially considering Tony's age and recent back injury. It won't happen, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be a great move for the future of the franchise.`` Headline: Umar Akmal declared fit",
