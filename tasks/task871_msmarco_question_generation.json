Concept 8 Review. Cytokinesis in Plant Cells. Plant cells have walls, so cytokinesis cannot proceed with a cleavage furrow. Instead, during telophase a cell plate forms across the cell in the location of the old metaphase plate. During telophase, membrane-enclosed vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus migrate to the center of the cell where the metaphase plate used to be and fuse to form a cell plate. Best Answer: Cytokinesis is the process in which the cytoplasm of a plant cell is split. After replication of the nucleus, the cell plate forms in the center of the cell. This plate continues to grow until it completely divides the cell which is the completion of cytokinesis. During cytokinesis, the organs and all of the cytoplasm are split between the two cells. As the phragmoplast often forms off cell center, the attachment of the cell plate to the cell plate fusion site first occurs at one site and then progresses to other sites until the fusion is complete (Figures 1 1 and S3; [41 x Polarized cytokinesis in vacuolate cells of Arabidopsis. Cell Biology/Cell division/Mitosis - Prometaphase. 1  Some biology texts do not include this phase, considering it a part of prophase. 2  Now kinetochores begin to form at the centromeres. 3  When the spindle grows to sufficient length, the microtubules begin searching for kinetochores to attach to. a type of cell division where two identical cells are made: mitosis: the nuclear membrane fizzles away and the chromosomes condense: prophase: as mitosis ends, _____ begins: cytokenesis: during _____, the sister chromatids line up and meet in the middle: metaphase: the longest phase of the cell cycle, where growth of the cell happens: interphase After cytokinesis is complete, each cell enters interphase stage. The daughter cells are about = in size. The activity of each cell continues because they each have their own DNA and organelles Cytokinesis is the final step in the process by which a eukaryotic cell -- that is, a cell with an organized nucleus -- divides into two cells. This division of cytoplasm is preceded by one of two processes of nuclear division -- mitosis or meiosis -- that distributes chromosomes to each side of a cell before it divides. During plant cell cytokinesis, a cell plate is formed, beginning the division of the cell wall and cytoplasm. During animal cell cytokinesis, the cleavage furrow is formed, wh\u2026ich is a pinching in of the cell membrane, which begins the division of the cells cytoplasm and cellular membrane.

For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). In the end, the IRS position was upheld. It is interesting that this is the opposite of what you would expect \u2013 normally it is the taxpayer that wants to use the prior effective date and the IRS seeking to ignore it. The case was instructive of several principles that apply to retroactive effective dates. These include: For LLC's taxable as a partnership, the members are of the LLC are taxable directly on their percentage share of the income and losses of the LLC. Therefore, a transfer of an interest will result in changes to the shares of income (or loss) to be allocated to the involved members, effective as of the date of transfer. -The Tax Court will be more willing to accept a retroactive effective date if it can be shown that the later written documents is merely a memorialization of a prior oral agreement. Therefore, if this is the case, it would probably be helpful to recite this in the documentation.

For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). Therefore, the documentation will often indicate a date the documents are signed, and a retroactive effective date for the transfer. In the case mentioned above, the taxpayers had such a retroactive effective date. However, they did not report their ownership as being changed as of the retroactive effective date in filing their tax returns. Therefore, if one is seeking a retroactive effective date for tax purposes, the first requirement is that the document be above board as to what is going on. Thus, showing the true date the agreement is signed, along with an earlier effective as of clause, is advisable. -To be effective, a retroactive effective date must be allowable under applicable state law. In the case, the Tax Court noted that this was the case in Georgia, the state involved. -The purpose of the retroactive dating cannot be to obtain an unwarranted tax benefit. The effective date of the rule will be 180 days from the date that it is published in the Federal Register, which was January 15, 2016. That makes it effective July 13, 2016.",

            "input": "Variables and Hypothesis Variables Scientists use an experiment to search for cause and effect relationships in nature. In other words, they design an experiment so that changes to one item cause something else to vary in a predictable way. For example, if you open a faucet. (the independent variable), the quantity of water flowing (dependent variable) changes in response--the water flow increases. The number of dependent variables in an experiment varies, but there is often more than one. Experiments also have controlled variables. Examples. 1  A researcher wants to determine if the color of an office has any effect on worker productivity. In an experiment, one group performs a task in a yellow room while another performs the same task in a blue room. In this example, the color of the office is the independent variable. Researchers want to learn whether listening to fast-paced music helps runners perform better during a marathon. In an experiment, one group of runners listens to fast-paced music while another group listens to slow-paced music. The independent variable is the one the scientist changes during an expert, while the dependent variable is the one the scientist measures to determine the results of the experiment. Controlled variables are ones that could potentially affect the experiment, and the scientist keeps them the same to make the experiment fair. Independent Variable. The variable that the scientist changes during the experiment is the independent variable. Think of the experiment as a cause and effect exercise. The independent variable is the cause factor. For example, to test the hypothesis that a seed needs light to germinate, the independent variable would be whether the seed was left exposed to light or covered with soil. If you hypothesize that Cub Scout pinewood derby cars are faster when the weight is near the rear, the placement of the weight is the independent variable. These changing quantities are called variables, and an experiment usually has three kinds: independent, dependent, and controlled. The independent variable is the one that is changed by the scientist. In an experiment there is only one independent variable. As the scientist changes the independent variable, he or she observes what happens. The dependent variable changes in response to the change the scientist makes to the independent variable. The new value of the dependent variable is caused by and depends on the value of the independent variable. (the independent variable), the quantity of water flowing (dependent variable) changes in response--the water flow increases. The number of dependent variables in an experiment varies, but there is often more than one. The independent variable is the one the scientist changes during an expert, while the dependent variable is the one the scientist measures to determine the results of the experiment. The independent variable is the one the scientist changes during an expert, ... Answer: An independent variable is exactly what it sounds like. It is a variable that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables you are trying to measure. For example, someone's age might be an independent variable. Other factors (such as what they eat, how much they go to school, how much television they watch) aren't going to change a person's age. Many people have trouble remembering which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable. An easy way to remember is to insert the names of the two variables you are using in this sentence in they way that makes the most sense. The hypothesis is worded so that it can be tested in your experiment. Do this by expressing the hypothesis using your. independent variable (the variable you change during your experiment) and your dependent variable (the variable that. changes in response and depends on changes in the independent variable).",

            "input": "Hurricane Irma is believed to have unearthed what could be a centuries-old Native American canoe along the Indian River in Florida. The canoe was discovered by photographer Randy Lathrop who happened to be riding his bike along the river. One of the two 40-foot spruce dugout canoes carved in Hoonah by master carver Wayne Price and apprentices Steven Price (Wayne's son), Zack James (Tl\u00e9l Tooch Tl\u00e1a.aa) and James Hart (Gooch \u00c9esh) arrives to Bartlett Cove. Around two dozen paddlers made the trip from Hoonah to Glacier Bay in one of three dugout canoes. Each canoe was outfitted with a sail that in the right conditions can push the large vessel up to 8 miles per hour. The first time the canoe went into the water was a very powerful moment. Flat conditions greeted the paddlers, and as they moved out near a couple of miles near Cannery Point two sea otters fed in the kelp bed. The 42-foot dugout was accompanied by two smaller dugouts and the paddlers inside worked in unison to make the canoe glide through the water with surprising speed. Planks could be added along the upper sides of the dugout to increase freeboard and breadth and the canoe could also be equipped with pole masts and leeboard in order to sail. Thus this native boat design was much used throughout the colonial and territorial periods by a culturally diverse population. An 8000-year-old dugout canoe was found by archaeologists in Kuahuqiao, Zhejiang Province, in east China. This is the earliest canoe found in Asia. The Moken, an ethnic group that lives in Myanmar's Mergui Archipelago and the north of Thailand as sea nomads, still builds and uses dugout canoes. Radiocarbon dates that close to 1492 makes it reasonable to infer that a larger island like Grand Turk also had a population of Indians who could have greeted Columbus at the time of his arrival, even if specific evidence for that has yet to be found. Archeological work is ongoing.

The commissioning of two, 40+ foot dugout canoes resulted in the largest, traditional dugout canoes in Southeast Alaska. The effort was lead by Master Carver Wayne Price, and after nearly a year of carving by a slew of volunteers, the final boats are incredible to behold. The process starts by flattening the top of the spruce log. Columbus did not, though most certainly aware of the countervailing viewpoints. Indians too practiced a form of enslavement and perpetrated their own atrocities against one another. But even if \u201cboth sides did it,\u201d one still has to be accountable, especially when Columbus and those who followed arrived as an invading force with the power to prevail.",

It includes the crust and part of the upper mantle that contains rigid rocks. Beneath this layer is the asthenosphere where the rocks in this part of the upper mantle are not rigid. The rocks can flow like a liquid or break apart similar to silly putty. But the surface of Earth is only the very top of the lithosphere. If you look at the cut-away globe above, you can see the rest of the lithosphere with its many layers like an onion. The very thin crust on top, the thick mantle underneath, and the huge core of liquid iron at the center. You must be careful with the word lithosphere, though. It is tricky! Lithosphere has different meanings. As we are using it here, it means both the rocky surface and the whole inside of Earth. But the deep interior of Earth is very hot, and even though the rocks there are mostly solid, they can flow over long periods of geologic time like soft butter. The crust and the upper layer of the mantle together make up a zone of rigid, brittle rock called the Lithosphere. The layer below the rigid lithosphere is a zone of asphalt-like consistency called the Asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.

A Bird's-Eye View of the Thames. In 1891, Sherlock Holmes was a character very much of his time and place, who appealed to British readers directly by confronting the messy, changeable world they lived in. Rather than dwelling in romance or in an idealized past, as many of Arthur Conan Doyle's other characters did, Holmes was grounded squarely in Victorian London. The Sherlock Holmes mystery stories, written over a forty-year span from 1887 to 1927, represented the good, the bad, and the ugly of Victorian society: its ideals, its accomplishments, and its deepest fears. Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson in fourteen U.S. films (two for 20th Century Fox and a dozen for Universal Pictures) from 1939 to 1946, and in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on the Mutual radio network from 1939 to 1946 (before the role of Holmes passed to Tom Conway). Short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the Strand Magazine. Doyle wrote the first five Holmes short stories from his office at 2 Upper Wimpole Street (then known as Devonshire Place), which is now marked by a memorial plaque. Portrait of Sherlock Holmes by Sidney Paget, 1904 Among the more fanciful theories, the story The Case of the Detective's Smile by Mark Bourne, published in the anthology Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, posits that one of the places Holmes visited during his hiatus was Alice's Wonderland. The stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were set during a period of great change in England. The time setting ranges from the late 1870s to late 1880s in The Gloria Scott to 1914 in The Last Bow.

On the other hand, cellular respiration produces the H 2 O and CO 2 that are needed for photosynthesis. They still break down the sugar molecule to release the energy so that it can be transferred to an ATP molecule, but they do it without oxygen. In cellular respiration, CO 2 and H 2 O are produced along with the energy. light energy is converted into chemical energy by plants during photosynthesis and. this energy is then stored in the bonds of complex molecules such as glucose, and. starch. It is these complex molecules which are given the name \u2018food\u2019. However, the energy in the food has to be made available to the cells in a usable form. This is the role of respiration. it up for respiration? In plants, O 2 released during photosynthesis in day time is made available for respiration. However, the rate of photosynthesis is higher than that of respiratin. Thus, plants give out excess O 2 in the daytime.

How do plant and other organisms obtain energy for various activites such as growth?..... 2. Name the energy-rich molecule formed during respiration from food..... 3. Give two differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Both animal cells and plant cells depend on cellular respiration for their energy needs, because both animal cells and plant cells need ATP. Plant cells may be able to use the energy from the sun to make sugar, but they can't use the sun's energy as fuel. Okay, great. So how do cells (remember, both plant and animal cells need energy, and neither can directly use the energy provided by the sun) get the energy out of the sugar molecule? They do it with a process called cellular respiration. In cellular respiration, cells use oxygen to break the sugar molecule. That releases the energy which is then transferred to an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecule. Respiration in Plants BIOLOGY 263 Notes MODULE - 2 Forms and Functions of 12.1 RESPIRATION Plants and animals Respiration is the stepwise oxidation of complex organic molecules and release of energy as ATP for various cellular metabolic activities. It involves exchange of gases between the organism and the external environment. The green as well as non-green Consumers get the food they need by eating other organisms. You learned that only plants are producers, and that they make their own food by combining water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy from the sun to produce sugar (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). This process, you learned, is called photosynthesis. Do you see the way the chemical formula for cellular respiration is the reverse of the chemical formula for photosynthesis? The only real difference is that in one, the energy is sunlight and in the second, the energy is the ATP molecule.",

Practical Law says lenders often allow drawdowns to give money advances to borrowers and set interest rates based on these short borrowing periods. Definition of income drawdown Income drawdown (also known as Unsecured Pension) is the name given to the facility to continue to keep your retirement savings invested and take an income each year rather than buy an annuity. This facility can only be used from ages 50 (55 from April 2010) and 75, at which time an annuity has to be bought or the money transferred into an Alternatively Secured Pension. The minimum income that can be taken from a drawdown arrangement each year is \u00a30. The maximum income is 120 per cent of a pension calculated according to tables produced by the Government Actuary's Department (GAD).

Caustic attack or caustic corrosion, is often encountered in phosphate treated boilers in which deposits of phosphates or other \u2018scale\u2019 occur in high heat transfer areas. Boiler water can permeate the porous deposit resulting in localize corrosion. #5. Boiler water pH and PO4 levels need to be in balance, a balance moreover that depends on the operating pressure. In the drum the concentration of chemicals is usually higher than in the boiler feedwater, especially for those (added) compounds that aren't taken out by the steam. water treatment, causing highly alkaline conditions. In boilers, the source of this corrosion is excessive use of hydrazine, or leaking internal de-super-heater elements in boiler drums, which allow alkaline Phosphates-dispersants, polyphosphates-dispersants (softening chemicals): reacting with the alkalinity of boiler water, these products neutralize the hardness of water by forming tricalcium phosphate, and insoluble compound that can be disposed and blow down on a continuous basis or periodically through the bottom of the boiler. Boiler water carryover. Boiler water carryover is the contamination of steam with boiler water solids. Common causes of boiler water carryover are: Bubbles or foam form on the surface of the boiler water and leave with the steam. This is due to high concentrations of insoluble or soluble solids in the boiler water. Criteria: The following criteria for total phosphorus were recommended by US EPA (1986): 1  1. no more than 0.1 mg/L for streams which do not empty into reservoirs, 2  2. no more than 0.05 mg/L for streams discharging into reservoirs, and. 3  3. no more than 0.025 mg/L for reservoirs. Boiler water. Boiler water is the liquid phase of steam within a boiler. The term may also be applied to raw water intended for use in boilers, treated boiler feedwater, steam condensate being returned to a boiler, or boiler blowdown being removed from a boiler. Ph And Phosphate Concentration In Bfw And Steam Drum - posted in Industrial Professionals: Boiler feed water (BFW) pH is to be maintained in the range of 8.0 to 9.5(guidelines) where as in steam drum pH maintaining guidelines is in the range of 9.5 to 11.0. Pressure of steam drum is 34 barg. In general, softening chemicals (phosphates, soda ash, caustic, etc.) are added directly to the fee-water at a point near the entrance to the boiler drum.

Radioactive material, e.g. medicinal or commercial isotopes, dummy explosive devices, The effective nuclear charge is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a polyelectronic atom. The term effective is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevents higher orbital electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus due to the repelling effect of inner-layer electrons. The effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer shell electron is also called the core charge. It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear Best Answer: Effective nuclear charge is essentially the charge an electron sees. It is the positive charge in the nucleus (atomic number) minus negative charge ... 7.2: Effective Nuclear Charge. For an atom or an ion with only a single electron, we can calculate the potential energy by considering only the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron. The idea of effective nuclear charge was put forward by JC Slater, and is the resultant charge felt by an electron in a given orbital after shielding by inner electrons.

Growing, or culturing, the causative organism from a blood sample remains the most reliable method for diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a more advanced test for detecting bacterial DNA, which may be done by taking a sample of tissue from the lesion. Cat fleas are respon- sible for horizontal transmission of the disease from cat to cat, and on occasion, arthropod vectors (fleas or ticks) may transmit the disease to humans. Cat-scratch disease is commonly diagnosed in children, but adults can present with it as well. The causative microorganism, B. henselae, is difficult to culture. Until around 15 years ago, only three human diseases were recognized as clearly attributable to Bartonella organisms: cat scratch disease (CSD, also sometimes referred to as cat scratch fever), caused by B. henselae; Carrion's disease, caused by B. bacilliformus (and limited to South America); and trench fever, caused by B. quintana. Adult fleas feed on cat blood; in young kittens this can cause weakness, anaemia and death. Fleas are important in the transmission of \u2018cat scratch disease\u2019 between cats and to humans. This is an infection with the bacterium Bartonella hensellae, and is spread when fleas feed on blood. Some dogs and cats develop an allergy to flea bites, which causes them to scratch excessively or develop skin disease.

            "input": "This is called the heat of fusion. It takes additional heat to raise the temperature of the water to reach its boiling point. This is about 180 BTUs for 1 pound of water. To change the liquid state into water vapor, it requires an additional 972 BTUs per pound of water. By changing state twice; that is, ice to water to vapor, approximately 1,300 BTUs of heat energy per pound of water has been stored in the moisture which is bound to the air. Any time condensation and freezing occurs, that amount of heat energy will be released, thus raising the temperature of the air. Best Answer: Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Water vapor high in the atmosphere can produce 'noctiluminescent' clouds, primarily from the space shuttle exhaust. At ground level it makes things humid and unpleasant, though it does prevent plant dessication. Dew and fog can be an important source of moisture in some environments. A broad question. Greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas (abbrev. GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Changes in water vapor and clouds are amplifying global warming A new paper represents a major step in measuring and understanding the Earth\u2019s climate John Abraham Overview of Greenhouse Gases. : 1  Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of certain chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). The increased water vapor in turn leads to an increase in the greenhouse effect and thus a further increase in temperature; the increase in temperature leads to still further increase in atmospheric water vapor; and the feedback cycle continues until equilibrium is reached. Water Vapor Confirmed As Major Player In Climate Change Date: November 18, 2008 Source: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Summary: Water vapor is known to be Earth's most abundant greenhouse gas, but the extent of its contribution to global warming has been debated. Using recent NASA satellite data, researchers have estimated more precisely than ever the heat-trapping effect of water in the air, validating the role of the gas as a critical component of climate change. Scientists will discuss the role of water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas, at a conference sponsored by the American Geophysical Union in Potomac, Maryland, October 12-15. Despite the fact that the water vapour concentration of the atmosphere is 5 times that of CO2 (around 0.3% by mass for water vapour cf around 0.06% by mass for CO2), the contribution of CO2 to the greenhouse effect is at least 10% (and more like 25-30% with the water vapour feedback). Magma contains dissolved gases, which provide the driving force that causes most volcanic eruptions. As magma rises towards the surface and pressure decreases, gases are released from the liquid portion of the magma (melt) and continue to travel upward and are eventually released into the atmosphere.",

The sexual side effects of Propecia may continue after you stop taking it. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about these side effects. Propecia may also cause decrease in blood prostate specific antigen levels, and can affect the PSA blood test. Propecia is available in strength of 1 mg tablets; the recommended dose of Propecia is one tablet (1mg) taken once daily. In general daily use for three months is necessary before benefit is observed. Withdrawl of treatment leads to reversal of effect within 12 months. Propecia may interact with other drugs. Studies have shown that finasteride decreases prostate specific antigen (PSA) by approximately 50% during the first 12 months of use. We estimated the long-term effects of finasteride on PSA in men with and without a prostate cancer diagnosis at the end of the study. The effects of finasteride on PSA have been studied in several cohorts of men with symptomatic BPH. 11\u201313 Initial results indicated that finasteride causes an average 50% decrease in PSA by 1 year following the initiation of treatment. 11 This 50% decrease also appeared to apply at the individual level, leading to the multiply by 2 rule, which recommends that PSA in men on finasteride should be doubled before being compared with standard reference ranges. The long-term decrease in PSA in normal men on finasteride contrasts with the slow increase in PSA in prostate cancer cases on finasteride. Thus, in men with cancer the increase in PSA due to disease progression apparently dominates any decrease associated with the effect of finasteride on prostate epithelium. We noted that finasteride has a sustained effect on PSA in normal men but after cancer develops PSA grows equally rapidly in men on and off treatment. In addition to clarifying the long-term impact of finasteride on PSA, these findings suggest that the duration of finasteride treatment should be considered when determining whether PSA in an individual is or is not within the normal range. An article in the New York Times (June 15, 2008) suggested that men might be well advised to take finasteride (Proscar) every day to prevent prostate cancer. 1  I believe that important, unanswered questions remain about the safety and efficacy of finasteride for prostate cancer prevention. The PSA levels in men taking finasteride for the treatment of benign prostate enlargement usually decrease by 30% to 70% after one year and even more after more prolonged treatment. The theoretic basis for using finasteride to prevent prostate cancer is that almost all prostate cancer cells are responsive to male hormones (androgens). The initial arguments for using finasteride were that by reducing the overall cancer detection rate, it might reduce the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer and prevent unnecessary testing, biopsies, and treatment with its potential side effects.",

Answer Biology For example, one begins with the definition of low self-control as the failure to refrain from crime and then proposes low self-control as a cause of law violation, thus one\u2019s proposition is tautological (Akers and Sellers, 2004:6). Critical criminology views the competitive nature of the capitalist system as a major ause of crime. The poor commit crimes because of their frustration, anger, and need. The wealthy engage in illegal acts becaue they are used to competition and because they must do so to maintain their positions in society.

            "input": "The increase in the orographic enhancement factor from cloud seeding does not fully compensate for the continuing decrease from air pollution. Cloud seeding for rain enhancement is aimed at accelerating the conversion of cloud droplets into precipitation particles, whereas air pollution has the opposite effect of suppressing the coalescence of cloud droplets into raindrops and the formation of ice hydrometeors. The Asian brown cloud is created by a range of airborne particles and pollutants from combustion (e.g., woodfires, cars, and factories), biomass burning and industrial processes with incomplete burning. The cloud is associated with the winter monsoon (November/December to April) during which there is no rain to wash pollutants from the air. Topographic cross section showing the effects of urban air pollution on precipitation as the clouds move from the California coast east to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Maritime air (zone 1) is polluted over the coastal and Central Valley urban areas (zones 2, 3): no precipitation decrease occurs. The seeding effect might still persist there, but it is not associated with a decreasing trend of the unseeded conditions. It is apparent that the effects of cloud seeding and air pollution in the low-elevation areas are more limited because of the lack of an orographic enhancement to the rainfall. Air Pollution/Smog: This encompasses many greenhouse gases. Emissions from traffic and manufacturing plants form smog as UV radiation and heat cause the necessary chemical reactions to take place. As a result, the amounts of UV radiation reaching the surface is smaller under these conditions. Scientists call airborne particles of any sort \u2014 human-produced or natural \u2014 aerosols. The simplest effect of increasing aerosols is to increase clouds. To form clouds, airborne water vapor needs particles on which to condense. With more aerosols, there can be more or thicker clouds. In a warming world, that's good. Sunlight bounces off cloud tops into space without ever reaching Earth's surface, so we stay cooler under cloud cover. But that simplest effect doesn't always happen. If there's no water vapor in the air \u2014 the air is dry \u2014 aerosols can't make clouds. Different types of aerosols have different effects, and the same aerosol can have different effects depending on how much is in the air and how high it is. Soot particles at certain altitudes can cause cloud droplets to evaporate, leaving nothing but haze. They found that additional pollution over pristine regions of the ocean has a larger effect on the clouds than in already polluted regions. Essentially, adding the same amount of pollution to clean marine air makes clouds brighter and hold more water than when adding the same amount of extra pollution to dirty regions. Scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) found that ocean-hugging clouds in clean regions are more affected by pollution than clouds in an already polluted setting. Cloud trails from ships, called ship tracks, are a small-scale example of this effect. Pollution exhaust from ships forms streaks of clouds that are brighter than neighboring clouds. The researchers learned that the amount of pollution already in a region strongly moderates any effect on cloud characteristics from additional pollution. Carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas produced by human consumption of fossil fuels, along with methane, nitrous oxide, and other carbon gases. Ship tracks, the long lines of clouds downwind of ships, provided a nice opportunity to study the effect of exhaust particles, called aerosols, on clouds. Short-term air pollution can aggravate the medical conditions of individuals with asthma and emphysema. Long-term health effects can include chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys.",

It is now known that babies are beginning to learn even before they are born. As I have read the latest research, I often find myself wishing I had known these things when my children were young. Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, as articulated by Erik Erikson, in collaboration with Joan Erikson, is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages, in which a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood. All stages are present at birth but only begin to unfold according to both a natural scheme and one's ecological and cultural upbringing. In each stage, the person confronts, and hopefully masters, new challeng The activities you do with them from birth to age 10 will determine how their learning patterns develop. As children interact with their environment, they learn problem solving skills, Critical thinking skills, and language skills. First children develop a sense of self and then a sense of belonging to a family. Living in the ninth stage, Joan Erikson expressed confidence that the psychosocial crisis of the ninth stage can be met as in the first stage with the basic trust with which we are blessed. Development of post-Freudian theory A child's first trust is always with the parent or caregiver; whomever that might be; however, even the caregiver is secondary whereas the parents are primary in the eyes of the child. If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularity, and dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. There is great interest on the part of parents in teaching children their letters and numbers and writing skills. The following lists show the pre-reading and pre-writing skills and beginning number skills that every child must develop in order to learn to read, write, and do well in math..

Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, as articulated by Erik Erikson, in collaboration with Joan Erikson,[1] is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages, in which a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood. The child is learning to master the world around them, learning basic skills and principles of physics. Things fall down, not up. Round things roll. They learn how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease. At this stage, the child wants to begin and complete their own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a confusing new emotion.

Young children in this category face the challenge of initiative versus guilt. As described in Bee and Boyd (2004), the child during this stage faces the complexities of planning and developing a sense of judgment. During this stage, the child learns to take initiative and prepare for leadership and goal achievement roles.",

            "input": "The process of alloying is used to change the chemical composition of steel and improve its properties over carbon steel or adjust them to meet the requirements of a particular application. Benefits of Steel Alloying Agents: Different alloying elements each have their own effect on the properties of steel. 1  Some of the properties that can be improved through alloying include: 2  Stabilizing austenite: Elements such as nickel, manganese, cobalt, and copper increase the temperatures range in which austenite exists. However, whether present as a residual element or added deliberately as an alloying element, the effects of N in steel are significant. N is an important and inexpensive alloying addition to steels. In recent years there has been an increasing demand to reduce and control the amount of dissolved gases in steel. In case of N being used as a deliberate alloying element in steels, N is added to liquid steel in the form of nitrogen bearing alloying additions or as gaseous nitrogen itself. Nitriding alloys are alloy steels with nitride-forming elements such as aluminum, chromium, molybdenum and titanium. History. Systematic investigation into the effect of nitrogen on the surface properties of steel began in the 1920s. Investigation into gas nitriding began independently in both Germany and America. The process was greeted with enthusiasm in Germany and several steel grades were developed with nitriding in mind: the so-called nitriding steels. Nitrogen and steel properties. Nitrogen can influence steel properties either in a detrimental or beneficial way depending on the presence of other elements in the steel, the form and quantity of nitrogen, and the required behavior of the steel. Normally most of the steels need nitrogen at the minimum level. Duplex stainless steels have a mixture of austenitic and ferritic grains in their microstructure; hence they have a \u201cduplex\u201d structure. This effect is achieved by adding less nickel than would be necessary for making a fully austenitic stainless steel. Salt bath nitriding. In salt bath nitriding the nitrogen donating medium is a nitrogen-containing salt such as cyanide salt. The salts used also donate carbon to the workpiece surface making salt bath a nitrocarburizing process. The temperature used is typical of all nitrocarburizing processes: 550\u2013570 \u00b0C. Numerous sources of nitrogen exist during the melting, ladle processing and casting operations of steel. Sources of nitrogen in oxygen steelmaking include hot metal, the scrap, impurity nitrogen in oxygen and the nitrogen used as a stirring gas. Nitrogen pickup from the atmosphere can occur during steel for at least 15 min after the addition of potassium bisulfate. Brown [4] describes a pro\u00ad cedure for the determination of total nitrogen in steel wherein the steel is dissolved in a mixture of diluted sulfuric and phosphoric acids, metallic selenium is added, and, after the removal of water, Fig 4 Effect of nitrogen on strain ageing index of steel. Effect during welding \u2013 Nitrogen generally affects the toughness of the heat affected zone (HAZ) of welded steel. Since the weld metal should not be weaker in a welded structure, the role of nitrogen is important. The loss of toughness is normally known as HAZ embrittlement.",

The overall risk of this depression medication side effect for children, teens, and adults is 2 to 4 percent.

Still, the use of antidepressants in kids and teens is slowly rising. One study published in March of this year, also in The Lancet, found antidepressant use increased from 1.3 to 1.6 percent in U.S. children and teens from 2005 to 2012. In response, the FDA adopted a black box label warning indicating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in some children and adolescents with MDD. A black-box warning is the most serious type of warning in prescription drug labeling. Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. Your doctor can prescribe them for you. They work to balance some of the natural chemicals in our brains. It may take several weeks for them to help. There are several types of antidepressants. You and your doctor may have to try a few before finding what works best for you. Antidepressants may cause mild side effects that usually do not last long. These may include headache, nausea, sleep problems, restlessness, and sexual problems. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. You should also let your doctor know if you take any other medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements. For many children and teens, antidepressants are an effective way to treat depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder or other mental health conditions. If these conditions aren't treated effectively, your child may not be able to lead a satisfying, fulfilled life or do normal, everyday activities.",

Most types of physical pain can be treated with pain relievers. Corticosteroids are often administered as an injection at the site of musculoskeletal injuries. They exert powerful anti-inflammatory effects. They can also be taken orally to relieve pain from, for example, arthritis.

Most plastic materials are compatible with EtO sterilization. 2.3. - Radiation Radiation is a type of \u201ccold\u201d sterilization. Gamma Sterilization Sterilization by gamma radiation uses the radioisotope Cobalt 60 as its energy source. Once formed, Cobalt 60 instantly begins to decay, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. The film samples were irradiated at a target-absorbed dose of 30 kGy. Gamma irradiated samples (GM) were treated at a dose rate of 3200 s/kGy. For E-beam irradiation (EB), accelerated beam currents of 1.5 and 15 mA were used. Both irradiation processes were carried out in the presence of air at room temperature. The effect of neutron irradiation on the tensile deformation behavior of zirconium was examined at room temperature at various strain rates ranging of 2.2 x 10-\u2022-2.2 x 10- sec-'. The microstructure of the deformed specimens was observed by transmission electron microscopy. It was established that neutron irradiation diminishes the uniform elongation and the strain hardening rate, and hastens the onset of plastic instability. These phenomena are attributed to inhomogeneous deformation in the dislocation chan\u00ad nels in the irradiated and deformed zirconium. The main disadvantage associated with gamma irradiation concerns the potentially damaging effects of gamma rays on the product, particularly those products that contain polymeric components. Another drawback with this technique is the bulky shielding required to store the radioisotope .

The study showed gum chewing not only had no effect on calories consumed, but chewing mint-flavored gum reduced the intake of healthy food (fruit) and increased the likelihood of eating junk food such as potato chips and candy. Researchers believe the minty flavor of the gum gave fruits and vegetables a bitter flavor.

From patches to hypnosis to pills and even gum, there are many ways to quit smoking. But is there a downside to these common treatments? We received this question from reader: Dear Dr. Manny, What are the long-term effects of using nicotine gum? Thanks, Theresa . There's no doubt about it that chewing nicotine gum is better than smoking cigarettes. But it still contains small amounts of nicotine - which is what helps reduce withdrawal symptoms in people when they quit smoking. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not required by law to be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. Chewing gum can lead to symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), which includes jaw pain associated with the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull. Ouch.
