I use the bright white during the day and the off-white is better for working in the evening. The brightness is adjustable by just touching the level button, which I can use as the sunshine or lack thereof outside my window changes. It has a USB port, which is AMAZING and perfect for keeping my smartphone charged. It even has a timer feature I can touch before leaving my sewing area in case I get tied up elsewhere and can't come back to it right away. I appreciate how easy it is to adjust where you want that light to shine by just moving the top piece. The cord is also quite long reaching a good distance.",

I did not know they could fall out, but apparently ours did and that's why the feeder wasn't working. The vet replaced the chip for free and now the feeder works perfectly. It took about a week to train the cat to use it, but she has no issues with it and the other cat is constantly disappointed that the lid is closed. One note, though. It says that you can program how long the lid stays open after the cat leaves. In fact, there is just a 3 position switch.

The cutouts actually work; I haven't met a charging or headphone cable that doesn't fit, a fantastic change from my old rubber case. And the buttons are exposed! Oh my gosh is this so nice, the buttons are finally click again and I can find the volume buttons easier now. Edges are nicely pulled back from the front and sides of the screen. I never have a problem with edge swipes and it still manages to leave a little space for the screen when setting face down. Plus it holds on very well while being super screen protector friendly, full glass protectors still leave tons of room with the case. Overall feel in hand is a little better than average I would say. I believe it to be rubberized, just not as high quality as something like a gaming mouse. Still nice to hold and very grippy, and holds up well. Overall very happy with the case, perfect for light carry while still being somewhat protective.",

Once that completed, I hung them up for about 20 minutes and then ran them in the dryer at a medium temperature for about 30 minutes (thank you to the other reviewer for that recommendation). With this approach, these bottles allowed for 3 cycles each, thus 6 jackets. The outcome is better than I expected. The Tech Wash somehow cleaned them better than my regular detergent and in combination with the Soft Shell Proof revitalized the color and fabric of all the jackets I washed (ski, running, fall, etc. jackets). It has not rained yet since I did all that, but I tested the water resistance by splashing them with water and it beaded up immediately. Nothing went through the fabric. This is not a cheap a product, but it does what it claims and it does so very well. My jackets were investments for me and I plan on doing this at least once a year.",

It was great after the first wash but the second & third just went downhill. I only wish each section of this comforter has a seal to keep all the fillings from separating. All the fillings are pretty much gone & this comforter went flat. The extra fillings left would move to the corner specifically to the feet corners which then drags the blanket off to each corner or off the bed. It’s very annoying that I have to shake the fillings to spread out evenly every night. I love how big the blanket is but this problem with the fillings piling up at the end of each corner & how flAt it has gone are a huge problem. I will be tossing this one out. It served well but unfortunately only a year. Before wash: It came inside a zipper bag. It was the perfect size. No damages. No stains. Not used. After wash: It took quite a while to dry since it was a very big blanket. High on dry and blanket came out great. No damages. No threads. No burn. I bought this oversize King for my queen duet cover. I read that to get it big & fluffy its best to buy a bigger insert for the duet. It was perfect. Big and fluffy. Made my bed looks extra soft and comfy. I'm always cold & will need about 2-3 blankets to keep me warm but this blanket was very warm. It kept me warm throughout the whole night. Maybe a little too warm that I kicked the blanket off the bed LMAO!! I think it is more on the heavy side & warmer. But it was perfect to cuddle & wrap my legs on top. My husband loves it as well. Overall, I would totally recommend this!",

It's a pain in the butt to sweep the floor of such a large area, and to bring my full-sized vacuum downstairs just to do a couple area rugs. We have a Roomba, but it only picks up about half the dirt on the floor, while flinging the rest around the floor. It's useless on carpet. I've wanted a cordless vacuum for a few years but the cost was prohibitive. After spending an hour and a half sweeping the floor (I move all the furniture to get underneath) I finally got fed up with the wasted time and effort and bought this little guy. I am so glad I did. Vacuuming up the dog fur, crushed Fruit Loops, and grass clippings is sooo much easier than sweeping! Now instead of ~90 minutes, I can get it done in about 20. Pros: Lightweight, powerful, compact, cordless, easy to maneuver Cons: -Battery life isn't great, but honestly it doesn't bother me that much, because for the portability and ease of use, and at this price point, you are going to have a trade-off. It's enough for me to get around the main floor of the house, the stairs, and the upstairs hallway before it dies. -It can be a little messy to clean, particularly if it's really full. I use a paper towel to pull out the dirt if it won't knock out. I'm a mom, so I've dealt with far more disgusting things than floor dirt and dog hair, so it doesn't bother me either. Helpful Hints: -Remove the battery while not in use - it seems to drain even if the vacuum is off. -Clean out the canister often. I usually do it 2-3 times per vacuuming (once for each of the area rugs, where dog fur collects, and once for the laminate). If you don't clean the trap, it backs up, you lose suction, and it uses the battery charge faster. -Tighten the screw that holds the handle piece to the body of the vacuum every few uses. Don't make it super-duper tight, but not loose either.",

When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book!",

First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.",

After spending many hours on the phone with AT&T, Apple, Sprint, Boost Mobile, I finally discovered the phone was previously a Consumer Cellular phone and Consumer Cellular will NOT unlock the phone because only the person who originally bought the phone from Consumer Cellular can call and request it to have it unlocked. So, unless you're a Consumer Cellular customer, this phone will NOT work on any other carrier, ever and is worth NOTHING to me. I have NEVER given a rating below 4 stars on any review I have written.

Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair.

I have a standard Samsung brand universal charger and it's not even close to being able to fit into any of the mouths. The poor shark was about split in half by the time I shoved the plastic down its throat. And then once it's that way, it doesn't really work how it's supposed to because the cord just falls out of the open slit. Cute idea but these ones are just sad.

It's not hot to the touch like an iron would be (the heating element is at the bottom) so the steamer touching the fabric won't melt it like an iron would, if that makes sense. It makes a funny noise as it heats up, it's a little alarming the first time because it almost sounds like it's going to have a mini explosion, but shortly after you hear the bubbling of the water, and then the steam starts. It's like 60 seconds from plug-in till it's ready to steam. I can get 2-3 men's polos done between fills. I try to rinse it out as soon as i'm done so the heating element is still hot and it helps remove mineral residue (we have hard water). Would totally recommend this to anyone! *also.... my husband jokingly dared me to steam my pores with it.

So much easier than cleaning a flooded basement! The only issue that we had with this os that the screw on the battery compartment is very small. It came with a small screw driver (about the size of an eye glass repair screw driver) but the screw was too tight to use that.

I went with these since they were a reputable brand and had awesome reviews, and I am thrilled with them. They are comfy and have a decent bit of movement to the fabric. The length is longer than what I normally find in the store, but it is a good length and I had no problem rolling the bottom up a little to fit even better. They are slightly snug on the hips, but not uncomfortable, so I would say they are pretty true to size. They look well made and I'll update this review if I notice any bad fading after washing them, but I expect they'll last pretty well.

I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results.

For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing.

With the push of a button, you can change the \"size\" of the ice cubes which is actually their thickness. It makes 9 cubes at a time, I wish it was more, but it still fills up the ice holder. To keep it going, I just empty the ice into gallon sized zip lock bags. It sits near the fridge, it doesn't need a drain and it looks attractive. The biggest problem with refrigerator ice makers, is that they can cause undetected leaks, that can cause terrible damage to a house. It did it to my fathers kitchen floor and ruined a structural beam that ran through the kitchen and laundry room. Thousands of dollars of damage to hos house!! When this icemaker fills to capacity it will shut off an a red light will come on, and it will wait until you empty it enough to get below the full mark. I accidentally left it overnight, and the icecubes were in fine shape, only a couple had partially melted (the water returns into the system to make more ice). So even though it is not meant to have the ice just sitting in it \"like a freezer\", I was impressed that they kept in as good of shape as they had! Love my icemaker and highly reccomend it!! For any reason, not only for medical. Now, if I was going to have a big party, I suggest starting to save your ice a couple days, or more, ahead so you have enough!

It is about a teenage girl, Mei Lin Yu, who is named after her grandmother who is one of the founders of their new world. Ten of the richest families left earth which was in decline and set up on a new planet, somewhat pushing the native people to their will. The final ship of Reachers (that helped build the first ten ships) may have never arrived. There are interesting animals, people with some extra abilities, and politics. As Mei is inconveniencing her brother and her parents are always off pursuing their careers elsewhere, she is shipped off to finally meet her grandparents for a couple months before she can hopefully get into the best school (at least if her parents' arrangement for a makeup exam following her missed one due to eye surgery gets her in). Well, she immediately hits it off with a monkey-type of animal and it sleeps at her feet and she talks to it, seemingly getting appropriate looks of compassion back. The people are interesting and she has several discoveries as she tries to connect with the lovely place where they live (not hard to do). The mysteries are beginning to unfold and many suspicions are being worked on. Can she help the local people she is coming to cherish? Is she really just a child who must honor her parents and their wishes? Does she even believe in these supernatural abilities some have claimed exist, including sensing weather patterns and talking to animals? She needs to know more and so do I. Can wait to read more, but I was pleased the way this book ended without a completely abrupt event that left me hanging in the wind too much.

I was excited to have a “do it all” griddle, however I was disappointed. 1st ISSUE - I should have returned it after the first use when I realized you cannot cook scrambled eggs without them immediately sliding off into the grease trap. It baffles me - why would I want a more pricy griddle with separate units that you can’t cook both eggs and bacon? Just know that anything with a liquid consistency CANNOT be cooked on this griddle. 2nd ISSUE- After the 2nd use, I realized that the temperature of the two plates did not operate correctly. When I turned down the upper unit (to keep pancakes warm) the lower unit stopped cooking and would not readjust back to set temperature until the upper unit was increased to the same temperature. 3RD & 4TH ISSUES - Also upon 2nd use, two other things surfaced. I realized that the upper unit doesn’t lie down completely flat on the counter surface so it remains sloped even when in the unlocked position. I readjusted to allow the end of the unit to be slightly off the counter. Which is when I realized that the I could no longer see the dials. Over all I do not recommend this unit for those reasons. Just buy the Presto product for half the money, have more cooking space, and an easy to use product. Use the left over money to buy a panini press or a apply it towards an indoor grill.",

These don't show through your pants and they stretch a good deal and do not fall down! These have not pulled on my leg hairs or anything either!!!

We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far.

If you want to get a first-hand account of King David's life that accurately describes in detail some of his most painful and joyful times on earth look no further.I was blown away reading from King David's own words, through Matthew Robert Payne,how he dealt with the many attacks that came against him.He was indeed a Man after God's own heart! David never gave up on God.He shows us how if we have faith and patience,God will make a way where there seems to be no way.I couldn't put this book down.So I didn't! Not until I had read the whole book.King David's interview will truly open your eyes to the goodness of God and encourage you to hunger for an intimate relationship with God the Father and Jesus.Everyone should read this book.Thanks Matthew for another awesome book that is literally OUT OF THIS WORLD!",

My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake.

As my business grows, learning to be an effective and genuine leader to my employees is much harder than the actual work I do! Meredith Holley's book, The Inclusive Leader's Guide to a Healthy Workplace Culture did two things for me immediately: 1) It gave me a sense of relief because she speaks to exactly what I need-clear, concise and relatable situations that I can easily layer over my own experiences. 2) It gave me tools to begin looking at my business with the goal of creating a stronger, healthier and more welcoming environment for my employees. Meredith Holley does a great job of making the information presentable. She breaks down the idea, provides examples of real life situations, and gives concrete tools to implement the idea. She manages to do this in a manner that makes space for personal reflection without shame. Several times while reading through her book I found myself evaluating myself and how I responded to past situations with employees. Each time I moved to negativity about my choice, the next sentence would be a reassuring nudge that moved me to a new and more useful thought process. This book gives me an opportunity to look at my role in my company's culture and to create a system of empowerment so I can decide what, when and how I want to make changes in my company. This is a quick and insightful read, and I know I will come back to it many times to make sure I'm creating the kind of working environment I am proud to be leading.

I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn't get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It's heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it's not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff. No problem there. For the money, you can't beat it. Best one of these I've bought to date-- and I've been using some version of these for over forty years.",

Our kids had no idea it was not regular milk and practically licked their bowls clean. I was worried about the consistency but after 15 minutes in the mixer, you can see above it came out thick and rich. It was so tasty. Today we warmed up the leftover chocolate in the microwave for hot chocolate. The consistency stayed the same.

The hardest part about this whole ordeal is that you don't realize how awful it truly is until after you put it together, and they require you to disassemble it to send it back.

I am 6'4\" and weigh 250 pounds and put one pillow just above my knees. The strap is very handy as I typically switch from 'left side' to 'right side' throughout the night. It isn't necessarily the separation that helps me as much as keeping my 'upper' leg from falling forward and twisting my lower back out of alignment. This, the pillow does a good job of. I did try to use my wife's pillow as a second pillow between my legs but it was just too much. Then I noticed the shape of the pillow might accommodate my head. I wear a full face CPAP mask which would get pushed loose on my traditional pillow. I tried the knee pillow as a head pillow, placing my face on the thick edge and allowed the face mask to project from the pillow free from pressure of any kind. It worked! Since I roll over from side to side through the night, the mask just projects from the other side as I settle in. Just remember to get your face up on the thick part so the mask doesn't touch the pillow. The knee pillow will stay securely between your legs and it becomes second nature to keep your legs together as you turn from side to side. This is not a 'cure all' but it will help keep your lower back from going out. I also use an inversion table and do lower back exercises every day. All in all, I would say this pillow is good as part of an overall treatment regime to relieve back pain. Oh, and it doesn't stink. I would buy this again, if for no other reason than it has a strap that helps keep it from getting lost in the bed. (strap was removed for use as a head pillow)",

Pocket is a little bit stretchy, had room for key, IDs, gels and my Keltec .380 but it can also fit my larger Taurus 9 if I wanted it when hiking. I hope the fabric holds up over the time of using it.

I clip it onto the side of my pants and wear a long shirt to cover it. It does beep, but I haven't figured out yet if there's a way to shut the sound off. That's the only downside in my opinion. Arrived super quick. I was thankful for the one day shipping option because of the amount of pain I was in at the time of ordering. I still have to take pain meds, but not as frequently.

NO! it is not affordable for me! Surprisingly I found this Phoebe mouth guard for my grinding teeth, which can save me a lot of money, and to be honest I did not have high expectation in the beginning but the price is so good for me then I decided to have a try, and never thought it could work so well to stop the damage from teeth fringing! Here are some tips of what I have done as below: 1. Drop the mouth guard into the hot water. (one piece at a time), and just lightly hot warm water. 2. Use a wooden spoon to scoop the guard in the hot water and shake off all hot water. 3. Grab the guard and place it on the row of teeth you are molding. Use the indention in the center of the guard to line it up with the center of your row of teeth. 4. Once it is in your mouth, close your mouth and begin to suck in--almost as if there is food stuck on your teeth that you're trying to remove without a toothpick. Also, while you're doing that, press down your lips towards your teeth to give it an extra help to mold to the front of your teeth. Use your tongue to get inside in place. 5. Keep the guard in your mouth until you feel it firm up. It'll probably take a minute or so to set. In addition, there are 3 packs with optional sizes to choose from, it was slightly tricky to get it to perfectly set comfortably on my teeth. But that is fine--if you don't get it the first time you can always try to reset it by dunking the pieces back into the hot water. By the 2nd (or 3rd) it should be pretty easy to get it exactly the way you want to be.",

I'm not 100% sure it was the cases fault but my glass did begin to lift at the corner the next day. If you want something that looks good, steer clear.

Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer.

It was expensive for the 16 ounce bottle I bought at my pet store, but it was worth it! It took a few uses for my puppy to get used to being sprayed, but once she got the rub down she was hooked & she was flea & tick free. Then summer came & we had an infestation of ants in my kitchen (I bake a lot). I got online to read more about other products in the Wondercide line & read that it repels ants as well so I tried it on a trail of ants & it worked! Now that I have a new puppy to add to my family, I use the flea & tick product again and I now order the house & garden product for the ants when they come. They really don't like it & seem to stay away as long as I spray. Thank you Amazon for selling the products at more affordable prices! And I love the smell of the product!!",

Runny nose, teary eyes, swollen lips. The whole nine yards. The heat is intense, it took me for a ride, but a very tasty one indeed.

The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe.",

I thought this to be true as I had purchases them before from a retail store and was looking for an exact replacement. I hate how polyester socks feel on my feet. When I got the product, it is now a primarily polyester fabric with a lesser amount of cotton(in the 30% area if I remember right)making them polyester socks not cotton. I dont know why Hanes and Fruit of the Loom have stopped making cotton tube socks but it is really irritating. I am having no luck finding a suitable, quality replacement.

I love when the foundation of a relationship is set up before the two people even meet, it really forces you to connect with the characters more and be more invested in them and their lives. Ryder was an interesting character. He’s smart and hard working, I felt like he was still trying to prove to his dad that he was going to be ready to take over for him one day, but at the same time he was also having some second thoughts, like he hasn’t really figured out what he wanted to do with his life yet. For someone who is always on the move with people all around him he felt very lonely to me. It wasn’t surprising that he ended up reaching out to a random person online, although the fact that she was a cam girl was a little surprising. I have to say Ryder is just so lovable, he’s kind to Eden, he’s interested in way more than what she does for a living, and when they finally meet the way he is with her and her home life, I mean he couldn’t be any more great. Eden, wow, Eden. I have a lot of respect for her, I know a lot of people look down at people who do things like be a cam girl, but sometimes in life you need money to take care of your family. And frankly she’s amazing at taking care of her family. I loved seeing her and Ryder interact. I was invested in these two, and the chemistry was awesome.

His book provides excellent insights into the challenges and problems of ordinary people like you and me who are struggling to make sense of the world and to cope with its incidents and trials. That's the first aspect. The second aspect are his plans and procedures which lead to the formulation of effective attitudes and values. This is where the book is so valuable. It opens up a path of hope for people who want their lives to improve and to have meaning. The rules Jordon Peterson outlines make perfect sense once he has finished explaining them - in fact many readers will wonder why they didn't previously see what was staring them in the face. These rules are particularly helpful to young men and women commencing their adult lives. These rules clarify what may have only been perceived dimly or not at all. While reading this book I felt that I as a fallible human being was being reached out by another human being who understands the potential of any of us to make poor decisions as well as good ones. The many incidents that Jordan Peterson describes in his book by way of illustration bring a very human dimension to his work. If you have older children or grandchildren buy a copy of this book for them. You will give them a true investment in their future.",

This is not a litrpg book anymore, it is a romance novel, a poorly written romance novel. The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now.

Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee.

There are lots of modes to cycle through, from short and medium flashes to dim up, dim down to solid ON. It takes a minute to get used to holding down the button to turn it off, but once you've got that, the light \"remembers\" what mode it was in when you turned it off, and comes back to that mode when you turn it back on, which to me is exactly the right behavior.

The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend.

Within two weeks of it arriving, the hard drive started to make \"the click of death\" noise. (Looked up the hard drive they used and it has awful reviews). I got into contact with the Cyberpower's customer service and attempted to RMA the hard drive. A week later I got an email from them saying something along the lines of \"We're not going to replace the hard drive because when we received it, we observed a small dent on the outside which voids your warranty, have a nice day.\" It was completely fine before shipping and adequately protected, I wouldn't put it past them to have made the dent themselves. Unfortunately I didn't have photographic evidence to dispute so I angrily purchased a replacement. Fast forward a few months, when everything on my PC starts to lag like crazy. Take it into a shop for a diagnostic and behold, the DVI port for the graphics card has gone bad. I'm currently stuck in RMA hell with them trying to get that replaced as well.

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge.",

I'm not a hardcore audiophile but most of the in ear headphones that I've used either have decent bass response but sound dull on the higher frequencies or have clear highs but wind up sounding tinny because of poor low end performance. Most headphones use either balanced armature or dynamic drivers each of which has its pros and cons. These incorporate both types of technology into their drivers . I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks. At $60 they aren't cheap but they sound a lot better than Beats that are twice as much money. I'm very happy with them and I think they are a relative bargain.",

I took it to camp to test out the durability. This speaker held out really well. The front amps get very loud when paired by Bluetooth. In my case I used an iPhone XS. In my case i used the speaker while I was outside By the campfire. Battery: I tested the battery nonstop and noticed that I got easily 6-8 hours on constant use. In my defense my phone didn’t last as long thus battery life is very subjective to the loudness and if Bluetooth is use. I mostly connected the device via Bluetooth. Features: The main features that this speaker has are the micro sd card slot, and microphone built in. I used the speaker for offline use by transmitting music via bluetooth. Because I was camping the service in my area was fairly poor, thus just adding my whole music library to the micro sd or usb is very convenient.",

I think its actually a bed level gauge. Even the spools have little helpful things like markers so you know much much you have left at different periods. I know it may not be much to you. I do have to use higher temps for my applications but thats with all of my PLA and its due to environment, etc. etc. I like these guys/gals.",

I was so transfixed in the story that I couldn't see the plot twists (WHICH ARE AMAZING) coming. Also, you NEED to write a second book cause there is so many things left unsaid that I want to know. I think this book would be a great TV Show. In fact I think this book turned into a show could give The Walking Dead a run for its money. All in all, if you want a good book to escape into you should read this one! Guess I have to wait around and see if he does a second book, till then I am going to be reading it again because its that good!",

Before I tried some traditional ear plugs, but to my dismay, they influence the sound itself too much, muffling and dulling it. These ear plugs gave me the full experience of the concert and I was left with no pain or ringing sound in my ear. I am super hyped about them and will definitely use them from now on.

Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible! The horrible damage it does to wildlife is astronomical as it doesn't stop with the rodent but is passed on to every predator and scavenger in the ecosystem.",

I liked it at first but comparing it to the ones I purchased from Liberty Imports these cars look SO MUCH CHEAPER and feels so flimsy and weak. Initially what I liked about these were the friction wheels seemed more intact and aligned compared the my other purchase, until the day it happened and the friction started messing up and would not roll as good as before. I've tried reaching to the seller but they were giving me such a hard time that I honestly dont want to deal with them anymore and just having to return them back to amazon. Overall with the cheap look, cheap plastic material and design, cheap wheels, and horrible customer service I would give it negative star if I could. Stray away from this and go somewhere else like Liberty Imports. Looks so much better, feels sturdier, and more worth your money.",

One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track.

So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I’ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn’t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that’s the only upside for me.

Then I remember another reviewer said you have to turn the barrel as you go down the hair, so that's what I did. I sort of kept wrapping it as I was sliding it through my hair. One important thing is to make sure that little lip on the wand is the side that is close to your scalp. I forgot that part and accidentally singed my forehead, I hope the burn isn't too bad! Anyway, so here is a picture I took. This literally took me like 5 minutes on dirty hair. All I did was brush out my hair and pop in a few curls, VERY pleased with how easy it is. It does sort of pull on your hair a bit, but I'm sure I will get better with that in time. And yeah, they aren't perfect, but this was my first time and I wasn't going for perfection, I was trying to see if it worked. I hope this helps someone else make the decision.

Another major point of contention is that the author advises the TOTALL elimination of a staggering amount of ingredients found in modern food despite the fact that its admitted that it is unknown if it is actually harmful. If you think you can do this great for you but I think it is misleading to the public. There is some whisper (and not a scientific one) of a chemical, preservative, or additive in food and it is \"Throw it out. Don't let your child near it.\".

The only issue I have with this product is that instead of having a common theme there are just a bunch of random words for each puzzle. I really enjoy puzzles where all the words follow a common theme for that specific puzzle.

Used it on last month which included snorkelling, beach & pool swimming and diving, and also every now and then to take my phone into the shower or bath. Touch screen doesn’t work when underwater, but works fine otherwise. You’ll have to use volume buttons to take pictures and get creative with how you operate it, e.g. telling Siri to unlock your iphone just so the passcode/word screen pops up so you can unlock it (not sure about face recognition). You also have to take a lot of the air out from the inside so that you can see the screen better underwater.

Ok, so let's talk about what came in the box. It includes a nice remote, the A/V cables, power cord, and a bonus HDMI cable! The packaging is really high quality and projector looks and feels so as well. Setup was super easy, about 2mins and I had YouTube projected on my wall. I have to say the picture quality was way better than I expected! I don't even currently have a screen, so I was projecting it on my bare wall that's not even white. I will say, it does help to have it as dark as possible when watching. If there is a negative, it's that it's not crazy bright, but I didn't expect that for a sub $200 HD projector. With that said, I think it's just fine in most cases. I imagine with a proper screen, or even a flat white wall, it would look dang good. I didn't take a picture of the image it showed just because I feel like it's rather hard to capture what it looks like with a still image.

The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn’t working properly.
