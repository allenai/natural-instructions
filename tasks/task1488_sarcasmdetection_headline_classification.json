        "In this task, you are given a news headline in English. You are expected to classify the post into two classes: sarcastic or non-sarcastic. A sarcastic sentence is one that refers to the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say, especially in order to insult someone, or to show irritation, or just to be funny."
