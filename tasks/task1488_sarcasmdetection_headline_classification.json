    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a news headline in English. You are expected to classify the post into two classes: sarcastic or non-sarcastic. A sarcastic sentence is one that refers to the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say, especially in order to insult someone, or to show irritation, or just to be funny.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "I work 40 hours a week for me to be this poor.",
            "output": "sarcastic",
            "explanation": "Here, the person means to say that even after working 40 hours a week, he is still poor. Thus it actually contradicts to what he says."
        },
        {
            "input": "5 ways to file your taxes with less stress",
            "output": "non-sarcastic",
            "explanation": "This is a pretty straightforward remark because it is related to filing taxes with minimal stress and is unrelated to irony or sarcasm."
        }
    ],
    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "I’m not saying I hate you, what I’m saying is that you are literally the Monday of my life",
            "output": "Cool",
            "explanation": "You are expected to return \"sarcastic\" or \"non-sarcastic\". This should be classified as sarcastic as Monday, being the first working day of the week, is pretty stressful and often hated by many. But the speaker is saying that he doesn't hate, so he uses sarcasm."
        },
        {
            "input": "Let me tell you a story",
            "output": "nice",
            "explanation": "You are expected to return \"sarcastic\" or \"non-sarcastic\". This should be classified as non-sarcastic because nothing has been specified in such a wat that it means to say exactly the opposite."

            "input": "I work 40 hours a week for me to be this poor.",
