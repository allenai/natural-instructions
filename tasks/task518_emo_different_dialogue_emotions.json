    "Definition": "In this task you will be given two dialogues. You need to determine if both dialogues have the same underlying emotion. The possible emotions are happy, sad, angry, or other. If they do output 'yes', if not output 'no'.",

        "Dialogue"
    ],
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'when did i called u ugly pony when did you ever call fuck u ur rlly a mad person asshole rnda bc'. Dialogue 2: 'go to dhapar math do sl maths a lot of places don't like maths studies it's amazing'.",
            "output": "no",
            "explanation": "The first dialogue is an angry dialogue and the second dialogue is a happy dialogue. Therefore, they are not the same emotion so the output is 'no'. So this is a good example."
        },
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'how are you today hello my friend i a m fine thank you how are you very good'. Dialogue 2: 'ai is not working properly maybe reseat the connector otherwise it's new keyboard time i'm talking about you baby your ai is not working properly'.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "Neither of the dialogues are happy, sad, or angry. Therefore, they are both the 'other' emotion and the answer is 'yes'. So this is a good example."
        },
        {
            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'my exam went too bad todaydisappointedface which exam maths'. Dialogue 2: 'and what happens if that peraon is forced not to be there with you it is sad but this is the reality  this kinda hurts but the point is i love her soo much and i don't want to loose her'.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "Both of the dialogues display a sad emotion. There, the answer is yes. So this is a good example."

            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "The emotion in the first dialogue is not happy, sad, or angry so it is an 'other' emotion. The second dialogue is an angry dialogue. The output should have been 'no' because the emotions do not match. So this is a bad example."

            "input": "Dialogue 1: 'sleeping or standing what is standing opt out'. Dialogue 2: 'for un now the tune is stuck in my mind bleddy poutingcatface that u r sexy'.",
