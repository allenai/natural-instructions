    "Definition": "In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. You are also given three addtional sentence options a,b, and c that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the the two sentence options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story, as well as its position in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a,5b', where '2a' means, the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a,5b' is allowed, and '5b,2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense.",
