        "In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a, 5b' is allowed, and '5b, 2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense."
