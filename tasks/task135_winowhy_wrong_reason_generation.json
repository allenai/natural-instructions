        "In this task you need to give wrong reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve (1) writing a sentence that gives no reason but relates to the content (e.g., mention the noun phrases that appear in the original sentence); (2) writing a reason that does not justify the relation to the correct noun phrases but another wrong ones."
