Each question is a mathematical problem solvable with high school math knowledge.  LaTeX mathematical format is used to express equations. \nThings to avoid: 1. Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B, 'C', 'D', 'E'. \nEmphasis & Caution: 1. Only give one answer for each question.",
