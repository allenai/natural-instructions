Inauguration — and why the numbers don't tell the full story  Trump 's fashion picks tend to be more expensive than Obama's. But that's not the full story. First  there's the question of custom-made dresses. For the past three inaugurations  the first lady wore a custom-made look. (Obama wore Jason Wu both times  and  Trump  wore a Herve Pierre gown.)  Trump  has reportedly struggled to find designers willing to work with  her . Meanwhile  many of Obama's most iconic looks are made specifically for  her  and are priceless  such as a custom-made Versace gown with a theoretical price tag of $12 000. Then there's the question of why it even matters. First ladies' outfits are not paid for with taxpayer dollars. You could be horrified that anyone could buy a coat that costs more than the average American makes in a year. But if you're going to criticize  Trump  for wearing $1 000 shoes  you have to criticize Obama as well.  Melania Trump's  2017 Inauguration Ball gown: priceless  custom-made Herve Pierre. Michelle Obama's 2013 Inauguration Ball gown: priceless  custom-made Jason Wu.",

            "input": "What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Chris Kennedy ? As  Chris Kennedy  campaigns for governor   he âs talked about  his  business successes.  He âs pointed to  his  management of the Merchandise Mart  âone of the great economic engines of Illinois â and to  his  role developing skyscrapers on Wolf Point along the Chicago River.  Kennedy   however  has not highlighted one of  his  biggest projects to date â a nearly half-billion dollar public-private partnership to build a convention center and Medical Mart in Cleveland. Local politicians  led by a longtime family friend  gave  Kennedyâs  company a no-bid contract and pushed through a controversial sales tax hike to pay for it. As the project got off the ground   Kennedy  told Cleveland residents the one-stop medical superstore would remake the Rust Belt cityâs image into a âDisney World for doctorsâ and draw coveted medical conventions to town. Instead  the project was plagued by accusations of insider dealings  secrecy and failed promises.  Kennedy âs company made millions of dollars  while residents are stuck paying more on items they purchase. Four years after the 235 000-square-foot Medical Mart opened its doors   Kennedy  and  his  company have long since departed amid criticism they did little to foster the original goals of the struggling project. Now rebranded the Global Center for Health Innovation  the building sits eerily empty most days â the glassy high-tech showrooms of its few tenants unstaffed and deserted. Subsequent management companies have failed to bring in revenue-producing tenants or the flood of health care trade shows once promised.  Kennedy  said  he  was only trying to help Clevelandâs leaders achieve their goals of a new convention center and a revitalized downtown.  He  said  his  company took on a project when few were looking at the city  and the long-term business plan shifted after  he  left. âIt certainly wasnât a secretive contract. It certainly wasnât done without public scrutiny â  he  told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. âI donât know what generated more press coverage in Cleveland.â âHonestly  did we pull a fast one? Did we slide one by?â  Kennedy  added. âNo  I donât think any of that happened. I think everybody knew everything by the time we completed our deal. Thatâs what I believe.â Cuyahoga Countyâs current executive  Armond Budish  told reporters last month that he could call the Medical Mart building âan inherited albatross â but chooses to remain hopeful the development someday will succeed. Tim Hagan  a  Kennedy  family friend  spearheaded the push for the Medical Mart when he was a county commissioner a decade ago. Hagan said he stands by his decision to support  Kennedy âs project but acknowledged the development has fallen short. âThe point of what we were trying to do is make the convention facility â¦ more attractive for outside investments to come in for events â Hagan said over coffee in a recent interview in Cleveland. âHas it worked out â¦ as much as we thought it was going to work out  immediately? No  I donât think so.â Heywood Sanders is an urban planning and public policy scholar who is critical of convention centers as publicly funded economic development projects. He has studied the Medical Mart deal for years and said Cleveland was blinded by its own misplaced hopes and the  Kennedy  mystique. âDesperate cities do desperate things â said Sanders  a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Sanders said no hard data existed showing that a Medical Mart would succeed or produce any economic benefits for Cleveland. âIt didnât make sense then  and it doesnât seem to make sense now.â David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. (David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune) Once a bustling industrial metropolis  Cleveland experienced a hard slide into Rust Belt decline during the 1970s and â80s. Its population and manufacturing base shrank as factories and mills closed down. One of the bright spots in the cityâs economic landscape appeared to be health care. The Cleveland Clinic grew over the past 40 years to be one of the most renowned hospital complexes in the world â rivaling the Mayo Clinic as a destination for affluent patients around the globe seeking out the best  most innovative care. The clinic campus sits several miles east of the cityâs downtown lakefront  which continued to decline over the years. Since the late â70s  some civic leaders held onto the belief that renovating the outdated underground convention center might be the key to making the city center a destination once again. The political and financial capital to make it happen never materialized. Investing public money in building convention facilities is often a divisive issue. Boosters often say if you build it  they will come; others say the investment rarely pays off. William Bowen  a professor of public administration at Cleveland State University  puts himself in the latter category. Convention center deals typically underperform their projections that spurred their construction  he said. âMost of the time  the valuation of the impact of whatâs built either doesnât happen  or â¦ they donât  as a rule  pay back the public coffers â Bowen said. âI think thatâs borne out by the majority of the research.â The hospitalâs involvement started to change the sense of possibility  and then  Kennedy âs involvement would put it over the hump  Hagan said. The consensus version of how the development came about begins with Dr. Toby Cosgrove  Cleveland Clinicâs longtime president. According to  Kennedy   Cosgrove wanted to leverage the clinicâs cachet to revitalize downtown Cleveland. Cosgrove declined multiple interview requests.  Kennedy  said a New York real estate executive who was Cosgroveâs patient recommended Merchandise Mart and  Kennedy .  Kennedy  said Cosgrove called  him  to discuss the potential for a mart geared toward medical professionals.  Kennedy  said in 2005  he  and another Merchandise Mart official met with Cosgrove and local and state economic officials at the clinic.  Kennedy  said  he  suggested the new medical mart be tied into rebuilding Clevelandâs aging convention center.",

            "input": "What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Mom ? Late last week  I called my mom to get a refresher on a few of her recipes. I wanted to make rogan josh  aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower)  chicken biryani (chicken and rice)  and paneer with palak (spinach). But my mom  like so many Indian mothers I know  has always avoided giving me complete recipes. Even when I visit home and watch her  she somehow manages to divert my attention by  say  dangling in front of my face a gol gappa  a globe of fried wheat flour filled with chickpeas and potatoes and yogurt. Iâm always missing a spice  a cook time  a stove temperature. Iâm never clear if when she says âgingerâ she means âfresh ginger  about a pinky-size  cut into stripsâ or âginger powder  a teaspoon or two.â Or  if sheâs feeling really casual about a recipe  sheâll say  âAdd the usual spices â a mix of 5 or maybe 10 different spices that might be usual to her but are patently unclear to me. Salt? Does she just mean salt? Worse  her measurements are not based on any contemporary or commonly used metric. A teaspoon  to her  is the size of the white plastic spoon with the snapped-off handle that she uses in all of the containers in her spice drawer that originally came from Dairy Queen when I was 6 or 7 and abandoned a half-eaten Oreo Blizzard. A tablespoon  conversely  is anywhere between two or three of the âteaspoons.â A cup is the cup she uses to scoop basmati rice out of the five-gallon plastic tub in the pantry on the bottom shelf. It is unclear where the cup came from  but it is cloudy and cracked and significantly smaller than an actual cup. Every other measurement she has  then  is specific to her grocery store  to her homemade spice mixtures  to her butcher who hands her a hunk of lamb the size of a small toddler  leaving her to break it down into digestible and cookable pieces. âHow much frozen spinach do I need?â I might ask her  and she will answer  âOne.â One block  she says  as if I can go to a grocery store and say  âONE BLOCK OF YOUR FINEST FROZEN SPINACH  SIR.â I suspect some of this is intentional. Indian women â mothers  in particular â hoard some of their recipes  refusing to give them in full. So long as they are the eldest women in their families  they are the gatekeepers for these particular culinary incarnations that exist only in their kitchens. (A cursory Google search for a good chicken biryani recipe yielded ingredients like chicken stock â my mom literally screamed when I suggested this â or curry paste  something that has never once been in her kitchen.) Iâve started to do this too  refusing to give my boyfriend a complete ingredient list  even when I need help cooking  because I refuse to let him in on a secret I have been scratching at for years. Maybe itâs about making herself needed as a mother  or forcing me into coming home and beg for my favorite lotus root  a recipe specific to Kashmir that Iâve never found at a restaurant. Regional differences are lost  the little things my motherâs motherâs mother did in the kitchen get muddied â unless I ask. And I have been asking  for years  for as long as Iâve been away from home and have been trying to find my mom at the bottom of a 20-quart pot. All of this reduces my cooking to a kind of trial and error. Once  when I tried to make her rogan josh  I ended up adding three times the right amount of cinnamon; my lamb tasted like an angry ginger snap. Two years after that  she casually mentioned that youâre only supposed to use flat cinnamon sticks  and not the rolled up ones  which apparently makes a fucking difference. When I last visited  she sent me back to my home with frozen rogan josh in my suitcase. Later  when I defrosted and ate it  I picked through it  pulling out any identifiable spices I could find. At the bottom of my bowl was a dark ball the texture of soft wood. I cleaned it off and texted it to my mom with my trademark calm: â?!?!?!?!â She gave me the Hindi word for it  leaving me to creative googling to figure out what it was. (I wonât tell you; Iâve invested too much to give it up that easy.) Mom swears that sheâs not actively keeping ingredients from me  that she just forgets because cooking is so second-nature to her. This doesnât explain why sometimes sheâll add an ingredient to her list for me â a year ago  the rogan josh recipe had coriander powder in it â later saying something like  âWhy would I ever tell you to put coriander powder in it? Nothing has coriander powder in it.â Now she says itâs actually garam masala  but not the kind you buy in the store (she says this with her particular brand of derision usually reserved for âwhiteâ grocery stores) but the kind that she makes at home  fistfuls of unidentifiable brown spices hand-ground with a mortar and pestle. âI will give you some when you come home â she always says  but she is a liar  because she never actually has. Food has always been my momâs domain  so maybe it makes sense that she doesnât want to give me her trade secrets just yet.",

Fiona Maye (Ms Thompson)  is a well-respected judge  arrives at home to  her  husband Jack (Stanley Tucci) telling  her  that he would like to have an affair  and that Fiona  if  she  cares about him  will tolerate it. This leads to the film’s single flashback: as  she  lays awake at night   her  imagination reaches back to happier times and to a moment of pure joy when he surprised  her  with a new piano.

As the numbers expand  these so-called twin primes become ever rarer  and the presentiment develops that these were accidents  and \"that solitude is the true destiny.\" But then  if you count long enough  you'll find another pair of twins  \"clutching each other tightly.\" Giordano depicts with aching vividness the traumas out of which Alice and Mattia emerge disabled.

            "input": "What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity James Cameron Jack ? This analysis has always been obviously wrong in at least one more way: Titanic is not a fun movie to watch. You arenât escaping from anything so much as putting yourself through an emotional ordeal: a decathlon of passion  dread  terror  numbness  and finally cathartic hope. You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this â and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if weâre focusing on the girls in the audience  then please â letâs really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fiancÃ© die (they donât)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course â but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you canât put your faith in a system like a ship â or a government â you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like itâs falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Audenâs closing lines in âSeptember 1  1939â: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship â have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom â with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameronâs abilities were  his imagination â big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means â still couldnât conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control â instead of just spectacularly destroying one â then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanicâs unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldnât: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot. Thereâs room for us both.",

According to a recent study from Data & Society  47% of internet users aged 15 and older have experienced online harassment or abuse at some point. Thirty-six percent of all respondents reported that they had been harassed directly  meaning they had been threatened  called abusive names  or stalked. When a story goes viral  this experience is amplified. âThis idea of people coming together within specific affinity groups and behaving in ways that are really good for the âinâ group and terrible for members of the âoutâ group [...] thereâs nothing new about that â said Whitney M. Phillips  a professor at Mercer University who has been studying how people talk online for close to 10 years and who has written a book about online trolling titled This Is Why We Canât Have Nice Things. âBut having different tools means we suddenly have new superpowers.â Though online trolling has existed for years  experts like Phillips worry that the election of Donald Trump as president may embolden people who already harass others online. Trump has insulted politicians  media organizations  public figures  and private citizens on Twitter  which  in some cases  has incited his supporters to launch social media attacks on the people he singled out. He has spread and amplified skewed information and has tweeted falsehoods. âWhat do you do when the president is doing the thing that youâre trying to get average citizens not to do anymore?â said Phillips. Truongâs story became a battleground for different factions to debate their own views about the media and politics. While roughly 70% of the 100 most retweeted tweets about her contained insults against her  the media  and/or \"liberals \" a little less than a third of all the mentions from that same sample were trying to defend  Truong  (and a small percentage were not related to the story).",

If you truly wanted to equalize and integrate schools  you would have to. But you can go a step shorter than that. New York City public schools are majority black and Latino. But you can go to any of the suburbs around  and theyâre very heavily white. So in New York and all across the North  you could simply move into an all-white community and go to all-white public schools. And thatâs how you avoided desegregation. In the South  most school districts were countywide. So you either paid for private school or you dealt with desegregation. In the North  you didnât have to do that. The key difference between the North and the South is for the vast majority of the history of this country  90 percent of all black people lived in the South. The South responds with Jim Crow  by passing laws that restrict the movement of black people. The North doesnât have to do that. It has a very tiny black population. Itâs only once black people start migrating out of the South in the 1900s that the North shows its true ugly racist head.  Goldberg : Youâve described something that I actually experienced as a kid in the 70s. I was in a school system growing up that was about 60 percent black  35 whiteâthe local system right outside New York City. Very unusual. My experience going from kindergarten through 12th grade in that situation was fairly tension-free. People actually got along. There was mixing  there was interracial datingâ¦",

Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  Joanne  already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  she ’d come down from the heights  she ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  her  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  her  post- Joanne  single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.",

That the band continues to thrive without Malcolm isn't a reflection on his lack of importance to it  but rather a testament to the enduring brilliance of the material he wrote  and the perfection of the musical machine that he designed to deliver it. So long as there's enough electricity left in the world for some guitarist somewhere to hit a ringing  window-rattling A chord  Malcolm Young's spirit will live on. Rock in Peace  Mal.",

Tesla is a part of that  but it's not the whole picture. It's moving people to electric vehicles  but what else could you do? Well  if you're building an electric car you have to have a lot of batteries  so you go to a battery factory. Well  if you've got these batteries what else could you do with them? You could do a battery wall  a battery pack that hangs on the wall â you charge it up and run your house and car off of it.

Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.",

Brooklyn is not the Brooklyn of the â80s or â90s (so  Lee  keeps reminding us). Mock: On another note  Iâm thankful that they got rid of the rape scene from the movie. I think the transition to dealing with sexual harassment and assault in the streets was the showâs strongest material  especially as it bled into Darlingâs art work  which helped solve some of her financial problems. The personal became political then became personal again. Serwer: I think part of the reason why that subplot is so strong is that itâs based on a work called Stop Telling Women to Smile by the artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh  who was also a consultant on the show. Fazlalizadeh put up a series of posters around Brooklyn with similar antiâstreet harassment messages she drew from women she interviewed about their experiences. Green: Spikeâs long talked about regretting that rape scene (and as recently as November). I agree  Brentin  that the show did a really good job of making sexual trauma an undercurrent without visually exploiting female charactersâfrom the street-art campaign to Darlingâs art student replacing Lilâ Kim with herself on the Hard Core album cover for a school assignment. With the âfree black female formâ as its thematic throughline  the show subtly deals with sex and trauma  complicating the idea of autonomy and who has access to it.",

Zhang: As you know  Novartis disputes the $200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah.  Mitchell : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins  the head of the National Institutes of Health  in which  he  explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017  NIH invested more than $200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers—Novartis  Kite (which will become Gilead)  and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]—are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? Mitchell: Well  we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now  the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis  so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite’s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was $150 000 for treatment  and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to $300 000. When we tried to model  we can’t get over $300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First  they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth $600 000 to $750 000 but they were going to price it lower at $475 000. And second  they said patients who don’t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay.",

We began to fight doping with more conviction.â All of these  he said  âare systemic problemsâ and the Sports Ministry was working to solve them. âNeither I nor the Ministry of Sport deny our responsibility for the performance of the Russian team at the Olympics in Vancouver â he said. âWe will do a serious analysis  and there will be changes  both in terms of organization and personnel  on the basis of our experience in Vancouver.â",

Scalia   in my view  is the best justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court in its 227-year history.  He  and Justice Joseph Story are the only two justices to have published books on constitutional and statutory interpretation.  Scalia  articulated a clear philosophy of a judge’s role  to which  he  always adhered.  He  was one of the two best writers ever to serve on the court and was equal on this score to Justice Robert Jackson  known for  his  fine literary style. No other justice traveled so much and spoke to so many audiences in the United States and abroad. Finally   he  was to originalism what Saint Paul was to Christianity — a tireless and widely traveled evangelist of the gospel. Understanding Scalia is thus imperative for all law students  lawyers and educated lay people. Because the book is a collection of speeches  many of which were given to lay people  it is very readable  understandable and fun for most age groups.",

She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs. And so when the war started  they were still skeptical about putting too many women into math majors because they just worried that all of this was going to be yanked away after the war. But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.â âHis character doesnât go through torment â  Cameron  later said of the role  âand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.â Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasnât his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron â who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984âs The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 â found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didnât think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay â\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . ââA three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by loveâs ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John âI know now why you cryâ as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. âBuilding Better Worldsâ is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameronâs Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies â or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men â and Titanic follows this example. Even if men arenât actively oppressing women  Cameronâs movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  youâre still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",

Goldberg : And itâs the black and Latino kids who are not winning because thereâs not enough whites in that sense to go around? Hannah-Jones: There would be. I hear this all the time: âYou canât integrate schools in York City because thereâs not enough white kids.â But that's only based on the premise that you canât expect white kids to be in the minority. The demographics of the New York City public schools are about 40 percent Latino  almost 30 percent black  15 percent Asian  15 percent white. If you picture a classroom like that  that's a beautiful school. Thatâs a beautifully diverse  integrated school. You could have that if you chose. We just donât choose it  because we automatically say  âYou canât expect that a white parent will put their kid in school with all those black kids.â  Goldberg : If you were the dictator of America  would you outlaw private schools? Would you force all the white kids  and all the upper-middle class and upper-class African-American kids  into the public-school system? Youâd have a deep level of parental involvement  right? Are private schools immoral in this context? Hannah-Jones: Interestingly  right after Brown there was consideration of whether or not Brown had to apply to private schools  or whether we should get rid of private schools in the United States altogether  understanding that the way to subvert Brown is to simply withdraw from public schools. Which is what happened all across the Southârather than share a public good with black folks  state legislatures decided to shut down public schools altogether and pay vouchers for white students to go to private segregation academies. We think it sounds absolutely crazy to consider ending private schools  but that was a consideration.",

He âs had a long parliamentary career;  he âs been in Parliament since  his  20s.  His  policies on womenâs suffrage   his  policy on Indian independence  and what happened in the Gallipoli Campaign [of the First World War] was a complete disaster. The invasion of the Dardanelles was a great idea militarily  but time slipped away from [British forces] and they didnât act quickly enough.

Exactly like this. If you went back in a time machine and stood on the deck  this is what you would have seenâ¦ Second Officer Lightoller would be over there â¦ and Wallace Hartley would be leading the band in a lively waltz just there  a few yards away â¦ [and] slaloming between these immovable pylons of historical fact are  Jack  and Rose.â In this way   Cameron  wrote  âThe film comes full circle  from being a film about Titanic  to being a love story that happens merely to be set on Titanic  back to being about the emotional truth of Titanic after all. By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.â After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time. Titanic experts who visited Cameronâs set had the same experience in the flesh.  Cameron âs devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanicâs passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didnât look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) â Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movieâs head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'â But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldnât be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldnât chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. âThere should be a little brass sign right here that says âPush ââ  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. âIt was one delight after another â Marschall said of his time on Titanic. But he didnât have to work there.",

Earlier in the week  we learned that the president has asked the Pentagon to look into staging a military parade. It seems intended as a celebration of the military and a demonstration of military might. So we thought  who better to ask about this than the people who served in uniform and whose service is being honored? And where better to talk about this than in the Barbershop  because that's where we talk to interesting folks about what's in the news and what's on their mind? So joining us today is  Jas Boothe .  She  served for 16 years in the Army and the Army Reserves.  She  served in Kosovo  among other assignments. As  she  prepared to deploy for Operation Iraqi Freedom  though   she  was diagnosed with cancer.  She  was eventually discharged. And  she  now runs Final Salute Inc. That's an organization that helps homeless women veterans  as  she  once was.  She 's also the mother of a son serving in the Air Force and is the wife of a former Marine. Major  thank you so much for speaking with us.",

The two men sent each other links to Islamic State propaganda material  including the February 2015 video that depicted the burning of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. They also exchanged information about how to buy guns online. As with most known cases of Americans travelling to join Islamic State  the internet proved a useful tool for  Hoxha . While it is often tempting to assume that individuals are “radicalized online” through their consumption of propaganda  this is rarely the case. More commonly  the internet allows people to make contacts with and plug themselves into pre-existing  real-world recruitment and radicalization networks. In  Hoxha ’s case  the network  he  found would encourage and eventually facilitate  his  travel to Islamic State territory. The court records show that prior to  Hoxha ’s departure  David Wright put  him  in touch with another American Islamic State supporter  his uncle Usaamah Rahim  and together they began helping  Hoxha  as  he  prepared to travel in the spring of 2015. The two men raised money for  Hoxha ’s plane ticket to Istanbul by selling Rahim’s laptop on Craigslist.  Hoxha  departed for Istanbul on April 6. A day earlier  Rahim contacted Wright on Skype with instructions from  Hoxha . “AsSalaamu A'laikum Zulfi asked me if you could delete his name off Skype ” Rahim writes. “But before you do it  if you have any saved messages to him go to ‘tools ’ go to ‘options ’ then click on ‘privacy ’ and click ‘clear history.’” These steps removed the interactions between  Hoxha  and Wright on Skype  but did not clear the metadata that would later be used in Wright’s trial.",

            "input": "What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity James Cameron Jack ? Reading the Titanic screenplay  itâs easy to tell which character  Cameron  wished  he  could have been: Even the simplest descriptions of Jack find a way to be adoring. One of Jackâs sketches âcaptures [Cora and her father] perfectly  with a great sense of the humanity of the moment.â Jackâs sketchbook is âa celebration of the human condition.â As Jack stargazes before his first conversation with Rose  he is thinking not just any thoughts  but âartist thoughts.â And as Rose begins to fall for Jack  we listen in on her first impressions of him: He âis so open and real...not like anyone she has ever known.â Remembering the iconic âking of the worldâ scene â one he later reenacted  to near-universal disdain  at the 1998 Academy Awards â Cameron described the kind of power  the kind of joy  that even the experience of commanding a vast and imposing structure â a ship  a movie set â couldnât necessarily allow you to feel. âYou see the power of [Titanic] â he said of the scene  âand you see the satisfaction of the officers who run the ship  and their domination of the elements. And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. Heâs an artist. Heâs a guy whoâs able to have his heart soar. Itâs his ship  man. It doesnât matter that he doesnât have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.â To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain â âa great patriarch of the seaâ in Cameronâs script â must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanicâs prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim âfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.â He can fully experience Titanicâs power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it â and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries â DiCaprio reflected in 2004. âI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.â From the beginning  it was clear Titanicâs success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 â staying on the big screen even after it was released on video â it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanicâs worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion. In a March 1998 article titled âFan Sinks into Titanic Obsession â the Associated Press reported that a 12-year-old girl named Gloria had gone to see Titanic  at the only movie theater in the town of Castelfranco Emilia  Italy  every single night since its release  and that she would go on watching it until she couldnât anymore. She had seen it 50 times so far and wasnât tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and â recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with â saved her favorite seat for her every night. âJack is cuter than Leo â Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.",

Some of his appetites  at least  had waned….With a pencil neck and a sagging jacket he clambered gamely onto the stage after Hillary’s acceptance speech and played happily with the red balloons that fell from the ceiling. When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters’ minds. …Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  Juanita Broaddrick  reported that when  she  was a volunteer on one of  his  gubernatorial campaigns   she  had arranged to meet  him  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   he  had changed the location to  her  room in the hotel  where  she  says  he  very violently raped  her .  She  said  she  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today’s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing—eager—to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.",

The most memorable scene of the documentary comes when she first plays the album’s delicate  acoustic title track for her grandmother   Joanne’s  mom. The moment verges on uncomfortable  and not only because Gaga’s father   Joanne’s  brother  gets up and leaves the room in apparent distress midway through. Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn’t seem easy. One scene shows  her  having  her  makeup done for a performance while sitting in a doctor’s examination room.",

Trumpâs feud with Khan fits his pattern of interaction with the London mayor  but his recent put-down of Theresa May was more surprising. It began when  late last month   Trump  retweeted anti-Muslim videos shared by a British far-right group. May said the president was âwrongâ to have shared the videos  which purported to show Muslims committing violent acts  and which have dubious provenance or have been debunked.  Trump  tweeted that  her  efforts might be better spent preventing âradical Islamic terrorismâ in the U.K. Upshot Khan is one of the most popular political figures in the U.K. May not so much. But  Trump  is so disliked within the country that Brits were united in outrage against  his  tweets and  his  rebuke of May. Calls for Trumpâs planned state visit to the U.K. to be canceled grew in the wake of the tweets. The lasting damage this particular episode has on U.S.-U.K. relations will likely be small  since  feuds aside  the âspecial relationshipâ continues to serve both countriesâ interests. Still  that relationship has long been more important to the U.K. than to the U.S. Trumpâs tweets make that even more apparent. * * * Tweet During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6  2017 Background The U.S. has forged close counterterrorism partnerships with Gulf countries  despite some of those countriesâ historical support for radical Islamist groups opposed to the U.S. This includes Qatar  which not only has oil and gas reserves  but is home to the largest U.S. military base in the region. Qatar also has what could euphemistically be called an accommodating foreign policy: It is close to Western countries but also maintains ties with U.S. adversaries like Iran  Hamas  and the Taliban. This summer  in part to punish what they called Qatarâs support for extremist groups and ties to Iran  Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a broad economic and travel blockade on Qatar and severed all relations with it.",

Such top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection—or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design—the Resistor Case  I call it—is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the “IKEA effect” to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I’m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use. (The kit provides a series of cards to prompt this conversation.)",

While roughly the same number of lawmakers in both parties are leaving their seats to run for higher office  just nine House Democrats are retiring outright or have already resigned  compared with 24 Republicans. (House members running for other offices often count as retirements  because itâs usually impractical or illegal to run for multiple positions at the same time.) Including those members who are leaving to run for another office  there will be 17 open House seats vacated by Democrats and 35 for Republicans. Democratic victories last November in gubernatorial and state legislative races in Virginia and New Jersey could spur more retirements among Republicans worried about the national political environment under Trump. And although Democrats must defend far more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018âincluding several in states that Donald Trump wonâall of the partyâs incumbents are currently running for reelection. The retirements of Corker and Flake  along with a Democratic victory in Decemberâs special election in Alabama  give Democrats an outside chance at retaking the Senate majority. In the House  theyâll need to pick up 24 seats  and the more Republicans retire in districts that  Hillary Clinton  carried last year  the more the GOP majority is at risk.

But many of those new fans probably didn't have a full-length introduction to  Petty  until  his  1994 solo album Wildflowers. They might’ve even ordered it through the mail-order BMG Music Service (12 CDs for $.01!) like I did. Two decades after  his  and the Heartbreakers’ first Top 40 record  there was Petty  mid-career  singing about middle age and slamming onto the charts with “You Don’t Know How It Feels.” The album's biggest single  with its literally head-spinning music video  lured young stans who  at the time  didn’t know their Damn the Torpedoes from their Full Moon Fever  but certainly knew how to groove to its harmonious chorus: “Let’s get to the point / Let’s ro-o-oll another joint.”",

Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanicâs final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanicâs production â and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million â this wasnât particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales â and stay the No. 1 movie in America â for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once â optimistically  as the final budget reflected â called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They werenât the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanicâs was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money â $32 million â during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentineâs Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while â for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise â the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?",

By the time my ancestor set sail on the Mayflower  Europeans had been visiting New England for more than a hundred years. English  French  Italian  Spanish  and Portuguese mariners regularly plied the coastline  trading what they could  occasionally kidnapping the inhabitants for slaves. New England  the Europeans saw  was thickly settled and well defended. In 1605 and 1606 Samuel de Champlain visited Cape Cod  hoping to establish a French base.  He  abandoned the idea. Too many people already lived there. A year later Sir Ferdinando GorgesâBritish despite  his  nameâtried to establish an English community in southern Maine. It had more founders than Plymouth and seems to have been better organized. Confronted by numerous well-armed local Indians  the settlers abandoned the project within months. The Indians at Plymouth would surely have been an equal obstacle to my ancestor and his ramshackle expedition had disease not intervened. Faced with such stories  historians have long wondered how many people lived in the Americas at the time of contact. \"Debated since Columbus attempted a partial census on Hispaniola in 1496 \" William Denevan has written  this \"remains one of the great inquiries of history.\" (In 1976 Denevan assembled and edited an entire book on the subject  The Native Population of the Americas in 1492.) The first scholarly estimate of the indigenous population was made in 1910 by James Mooney  a distinguished ethnographer at the Smithsonian Institution. Combing through old documents  he concluded that in 1491 North America had 1.15 million inhabitants. Mooney's glittering reputation ensured that most subsequent researchers accepted his figure uncritically.",

During Wright’s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State’s’ mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype’s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State’s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that naïve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that “if you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won’t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.”",

To gentrify a neighborhood also involves quieting it down. The desire for sonic control in and around the home is prioritized above the social fabric of the city  a practice exemplified by the targeting of arts and music venues that are cited as being partially responsible for neighborhood revival in the first place. In her book Beyond Unwanted Sound  Marie Thompson describes an example from the industrial area of Ouseburn Valley in the United Kingdom. The region had become a hotbed of music and the arts partly because there were few residences to disturb. Eventually  several venues closed after repeated run-ins with the law due to noise complaints. These complaints came not from concerned locals  but from wealthy newcomers buying into new developments built explicitly to capitalize on the area’s vibrant nightlife. The noise that does the most harm doesn’t come from clubs and house parties—the causes of many garden-variety noise complaints and violations. Ironically   Rice  did get something right in  her  crusade: Industrial noise poses the worst problem  although individual workers were not to blame for it  as  Rice  had also concluded. The two largest sources of environmental noise are transportation and industrial activity. The cars for which early noise ordinances helped clear the streets have amplified that noise to a universal  inescapable level. Industrial areas  often designated for land close to the poorest nonwhite areas in a city  are even worse.",

Omata ’s analog appearance also disguises all the electronics that make  it  work. “It’s hard to tell that  it ’s a computer on the inside ” Bleecker says. “People think  it  needs to be tethered to the bike.” Instead  a microcontroller  GPS sensor  barometer  and a set of motors make it work. After a ride   Omata  can be wired to a computer or wirelessly connected to a smartphone to download the same sort of data that its more obviously digital competitors make available: performance  distance  mapping  and so on. “Our ambition isn’t to get rid of the computation ” Bleecker explains  “but to hide it.” * * * These days  people try to hide computers by escaping from them  like I escape to my lawn. The machines “hide” inside offices or jacket pockets so their owners can accomplish other goals. In some cases  the drive to get away from computers degenerates into wistfulness. The word “analog” has come to indicate retro nostalgia first  a way of resisting or even abandoning bits in favor of atoms. Certainly  Omata risks such accusation. But the line separating analog and digital isn’t as clean as popular usage makes it seem. Writing in The New York Times in 2015  Rob Walker observed an “analog fever” in contemporary culture. A counterrevolution to the digital revolution. Walker cites the rise of vinyl records and the decline of ebook sales in favor of print as evidence of this fever. It sounds right to modern ears. But strictly speaking  simply not being a computer doesn’t make something analog. Analog devices represent information with a continuously variable portrayal of that information. They create an analogous depiction of a source signal in physical form. A mechanical watch  for example  measures the passage of time with a set of hands  driven by a loaded spring  that traverse the watch face. In the case of a bicycle  as Newman suggests  the crankcase moves the bike analogously to the rider’s physical exertion. Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. By contrast  digital devices sample a stream of activity at regular intervals  converting those measures into discrete values for manipulation by an electronic device. Since computers are the machines that usually sense  store  and manipulate the resulting digital signals  “digital” has come to refer to anything that makes use of computer technology. In turn  analog started meaning “not involving computers” rather than continuously representing a signal with a physical quantity.",

First  the DoJ explained that if  J.D.  were to find a sponsor  she  would be able to seek an abortion under  his  or  her  care and the complaint against the government would dissolve. But as the ACLU observed  âthe notion that an appropriate sponsor for  J.D.  could be identified  properly vetted  and approved in an eleven day time frame is entirely unrealisticâ. Second  the DoJ argued that  J.D.  brought  her  predicament on  herself . âAny alleged âobstacleâ to Ms Doeâs ability to obtain an abortion is by her own choiceâ  the brief asserts. She chose to flee oppression in her home country and enter America illegally  so she is author of her own dilemma. The obstacle to her abortion is self-imposed.  J.D.  can decide to remove that obstacle âat any time by filing a request for voluntary departureâ.",

Once when  Reinhard  was preaching at a meeting  some of the people did not believe in the power of the Holy Spirit. Suddenly  in the middle of his service   Reinhard  says the spirit of the Lord fell and people began rejoicing as they were filled with the Holy Spirit. As  he  looked around   Reinhard  says 3 or 4 people were standing and looking around instead of participating in the supernatural event.  He  says  âThese people must be asbestos Christians. They were fireproof even when the fire of the Holy Spirit fell.â  Reinhard  says we need to be people who want to burn with the fire of the Holy Spirit.  He  reminds us that the book of Acts reads better than any modern-day novel.  Reinhard  points to the book of Mark 16:8 where the disciples  before Jesus ascended to heaven  did not believe. That unbelief is also shared in verse 13 â they did not believe. Then in verse 15  says Jesus said to them  Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. In verse 20  the disciples went out and preached everywhere  the Lord working with them and confirming the Word through accompanying signs. Something happened between verse 14 and 20.  Reinhard  says the disciples walked out of weakness and arrived with the power to do what Jesus commissioned them to do. âPower is the essence of the Christian witness. Christianity is either supernatural or nothing at all.â",

People who fall in the center of the Venn diagram of  Assad  backers and Trump fans contacted in the aftermath  including both devoted members of the alt-right movement and those who have disavowed it  said they had been pro- Assad  before being pro-Trump. Many said they believed that  Assad  would protect Syria’s Christians after pro-democracy protests morphed into a civil war following the government’s brutal crackdown. Lue-Yee Tsang  an alt-right supporter in his late twenties who lives in the DC area  said he supported a president who protected and “supported the right of peaceful groups to maintain their ways of life ” as he believes Assad did. When the US election came around  Trump was the only candidate he considered supporting. “I’d love to have a Christian emperor instead  but given the field he was the best there was ” he said. A far right nationalist  who goes by the Twitter handle @IWillRedPillYou  who supports the expression of the alt-right’s views and who declined to give their real name  put it simply: “I support  Assad  because  he 's the defender of Middle Eastern Christianity.”",

It  was Nov. 2  2016  and  he  was strapped into one of two mammoth CH-47’s flying over the city of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan on a moonless night. Loaded with 59 men in all — a company of Afghan commandos and a team of Green Berets backing them up – the big birds were headed to a village called Boz-e-Qandahari on Kunduz’s northern outskirts. He and the rest of the men had no idea that they were flying into a deathtrap — one that  thanks to incomplete intelligence  would claim the lives of two Green Berets  three Afghan commandos  and 32 civilians  including six women and 20 children. The civilians died as the American and Afghan raiders faced an unanticipated onslaught of Taliban fighters reminiscent of the Mogadishu slaughter memorialized in the movie Black Hawk Down. For their actions that day  three of the Green Berets would receive the nation’s third-highest award for valor  the Silver Star  one of them posthumously  and Hunter was honored Oct. 17 with the Air Force’s second-highest honor  the Air Force Cross  along with five men on the gunship above them who will receive Distinguished Flying Cross medals. The citations for those awards make no mention of the errors that forced the fighters to act so heroically or the civilian deaths that led a United Nations humanitarian organization to call for an international investigation. Such carnage is likely to happen again as the Trump administration adds as many as 3 000 troops to the US contingent in Afghanistan. The top US commander there  Gen. John Nicholson Jr.  promised recently that “a tidal wave of air power is on the horizon” against the Taliban.",

The resulting two hours of truth-telling is probably more sincere than anything E! has ever aired.

Following the Wright trial  we made repeated attempts to gain more information on  Hoxha  from official channels.

Matthew Reilly  spokesman for the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office stated  “no defendant by that name has been charged in the District of New Jersey.” Unofficially  intelligence sources confirmed a rumor we had quietly chased for months. In October 2015  a video was released by the Islamic State of a purported American brutally beheading a Kurdish peshmerga soldier. The 15-minute video  shot from multiple camera angles  features four individuals dressed in black and standing behind captured Kurdish soldiers. Its subject speaks with the same accent and inflection as  Hoxha  in the May 2017 release. Multiple law-enforcement officials told us that the individual who says he is “delivering a message to Obama” and then commits the first execution is  Hoxha . If officially confirmed  it would be the first case of an American Islamic State member beheading someone in a propaganda video. * * * Little is known about  Hoxha ’s personal background. A search for  his  online activity finds a defunct Twitter account bearing  his  name  which interacted with other Islamic State supporters  as well as detractors. In October 2014  for example  the account engaged in conversation with the State Department’s “Think Again Turn Away” account  which at the time was trying to counter Islamic State messaging on the platform. He was actually not the first American jihadi to do so. Around the same time  a 17-year-old  Ali Amin  was also trolling the State Department Twitter account. A short time later  he was arrested and ultimately sentenced to 11 years for encouraging his high school friend to join the Islamic State.",

The Fox News host Sean Hannity  is facing heat after several brands pulled their ads from  his  show. A wave of advertisers announced they would pull spots from \"Hannity\" following  the host 's interview on Friday with Roy Moore in which they discussed allegations that Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old and pursued relationships with other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Some media observers have noted that Hannity directly asked about the allegations. But critics say Hannity went too easy on Moore — whom he supported in the Alabama Senate primary — saying he appeared to agree with a characterization of some of the conduct as \"consensual.\" Amid the left-wing media watchdog Media Matters urging sponsors to pull ads  Keurig  Realtor.com  Eloquii  23andMe  Nature's Bounty  and E-Trade all announced over the weekend that they had no plans to advertise on Hannity's Fox News show. More recently  brands such as Mercedes-Benz have jumped on the bandwagon  even as others such as MyPillow remain unfazed. Brands distancing themselves from politically or otherwise sensitive issues is nothing new. Several big-name advertisers were conspicuously absent from Megyn Kelly's interview in June with Alex Jones  the right-wing provocateur and conspiracy-monger. Similarly  in April  BMW  Mitsubishi  Hyundai  and Lexus were among the brands that pulled their ads from \"The O'Reilly Factor\" amid a wave of sexual-harassment allegations against its host  Bill O'Reilly. There has also been increasing consumer backlash to brands taking positions. But these emotional reactions are unprecedented  according to Canvs  a company that measures viewers' qualitative responses to content. It looks at all the spoken words about shows across social media and maps viewers' reactions with a range of 42 emotions. \"Unlike most emotional conversations about TV  brands have been raised to the forefront of the discussion surrounding ' Hannity  '\" a Canvs analyst told Business Insider. \"These brand-driven viewer emotional reactions are really unprecedented when you look at any show on TV.\" Still   Hannity  has seen  his  ratings jump since Fox News moved  him  to a different time slot last month.  He  was already one of the highest-rated personalities in cable news.  He  has also weathered previous boycott calls by Media Matters  partially by rallying  his  viewers and supporters  who started a #BoycottKeurig campaign over the weekend and shared videos of themselves destroying the coffee machines. On Monday  Realtor.com deleted an initial tweet about pulling the ads  and Keurig's CEO apologized for \"taking sides.\" \"The action is key because that is what will have a financial effect on  Hannity 's show  not the messaging that companies use \" said Angelo Carusone  the president of Media Matters. Carusone added that he was surprised that Realtor.com made a statement at all  considering the company is owned by Fox News' chairman  Rupert Murdoch. Business Insider asked several other brands who have advertised on  Hannity 's show over the past few months about their stances and whether they plan to do so in the future.

On a bike. So what? And yet  somehow  the result feels uncommon. The smartphone in my pocket buzzes—a text message or a Slack notification or who knows what else—and I remember why. Today  computers wrest people from activities outside the computer to work or play back inside them. But  the Omata  is pushing me toward something else.  It ’s nudging me to to focus on the non-computational activity I’m participating in  rather than reminding me of all the other  digital ones I might choose instead. What if more computers had that same ambition? * * * “Riding a bike— it ’s a very analog experience.” Rhys Newman   Omata’s  CEO  speaks with a Welsh accent that makes the matter sound profound  almost spiritual. “ It ’s man harnessing the machine in an analogous way to the effort of his body.” Not a spiritual thing after all  but a corporeal one. Using technology to assist with a worldly goal  rather than to displace it. Newman and his cofounder and chief technology officer  Julian Bleecker  met while working at Nokia. They were part of a secretive team at the company’s “Everyday Adventure” group in Los Angeles  where the two designed outdoor products  including a camera and a sports tracker. Once the world’s biggest mobile-handset manufacturer  Nokia shed 93 percent of its value between 2000 and 2013  when Microsoft acquired its beleaguered mobile-devices division. The company was ill-prepared for the smartphone. Between 2000 and 2007  it had been focused on reducing handset size and cost while increasing battery efficiency. These were phones for the everyperson  after all  not executive tethers like the BlackBerry. When the iPhone proved that approach to be exactly wrong  Nokia raced to follow Apple’s (and then Samsung’s) lead: devices with more connectivity  bigger screens  and better cameras. Maximizing attention was now the goal  rather than facilitating communication. Everywhere  computers are screaming at you: “Here I am! I am a computer!” Newman and Bleecker’s project spun up near Nokia’s nadir. Desperate to help reverse course  the L.A. group hoped to find a novel angle on a connected camera. The two looked to their own favorite: Leica  the storied German range-finder manufacturer. Leica’s flagship line  the M  got a digital sensor in 2006  but everything else about it remains mechanical. The photographer still adjusts focus and aperture by hand. For this reason  operating a Leica requires deliberateness  making the process of image creation an end as much as a means. That deliberateness would eventually show up in the Omata  which promises a “deeper connection to the ride itself.”",
