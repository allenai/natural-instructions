Trump  has reportedly struggled to find designers willing to work with  her . Meanwhile  many of Obama's most iconic looks are made specifically for  her  and are priceless  such as a custom-made Versace gown with a theoretical price tag of $12 000. Then there's the question of why it even matters. First ladies' outfits are not paid for with taxpayer dollars. You could be horrified that anyone could buy a coat that costs more than the average American makes in a year. But if you're going to criticize  Trump  for wearing $1 000 shoes  you have to criticize Obama as well.  Melania Trump's  2017 Inauguration Ball gown: priceless  custom-made Herve Pierre.

As  Chris Kennedy  campaigns for governor   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s talked about  his  business successes.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointed to  his  management of the Merchandise Mart  \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the great economic engines of Illinois \u00e2\u0080\u009d and to  his  role developing skyscrapers on Wolf Point along the Chicago River.  Kennedy   however  has not highlighted one of  his  biggest projects to date \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a nearly half-billion dollar public-private partnership to build a convention center and Medical Mart in Cleveland. Local politicians  led by a longtime family friend  gave  Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  company a no-bid contract and pushed through a controversial sales tax hike to pay for it. As the project got off the ground   Kennedy  told Cleveland residents the one-stop medical superstore would remake the Rust Belt city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney World for doctors\u00e2\u0080\u009d and draw coveted medical conventions to town. Instead  the project was plagued by accusations of insider dealings  secrecy and failed promises.  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s company made millions of dollars  while residents are stuck paying more on items they purchase. Four years after the 235 000-square-foot Medical Mart opened its doors   Kennedy  and  his  company have long since departed amid criticism they did little to foster the original goals of the struggling project. Now rebranded the Global Center for Health Innovation  the building sits eerily empty most days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the glassy high-tech showrooms of its few tenants unstaffed and deserted. Subsequent management companies have failed to bring in revenue-producing tenants or the flood of health care trade shows once promised.  Kennedy  said  he  was only trying to help Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders achieve their goals of a new convention center and a revitalized downtown.  He  said  his  company took on a project when few were looking at the city  and the long-term business plan shifted after  he  left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a secretive contract. It certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done without public scrutiny \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what generated more press coverage in Cleveland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonestly  did we pull a fast one? Did we slide one by?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Kennedy  added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any of that happened. I think everybody knew everything by the time we completed our deal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuyahoga County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current executive  Armond Budish  told reporters last month that he could call the Medical Mart building \u00e2\u0080\u009can inherited albatross \u00e2\u0080\u009d but chooses to remain hopeful the development someday will succeed. Tim Hagan  a  Kennedy  family friend  spearheaded the push for the Medical Mart when he was a county commissioner a decade ago. Hagan said he stands by his decision to support  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s project but acknowledged the development has fallen short. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point of what we were trying to do is make the convention facility \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 more attractive for outside investments to come in for events \u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagan said over coffee in a recent interview in Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas it worked out \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as much as we thought it was going to work out  immediately? No  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heywood Sanders is an urban planning and public policy scholar who is critical of convention centers as publicly funded economic development projects. He has studied the Medical Mart deal for years and said Cleveland was blinded by its own misplaced hopes and the  Kennedy  mystique. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDesperate cities do desperate things \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sanders  a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Sanders said no hard data existed showing that a Medical Mart would succeed or produce any economic benefits for Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense then  and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to make sense now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. (David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune) Once a bustling industrial metropolis  Cleveland experienced a hard slide into Rust Belt decline during the 1970s and \u00e2\u0080\u009980s. Its population and manufacturing base shrank as factories and mills closed down. One of the bright spots in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic landscape appeared to be health care. The Cleveland Clinic grew over the past 40 years to be one of the most renowned hospital complexes in the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rivaling the Mayo Clinic as a destination for affluent patients around the globe seeking out the best  most innovative care. The clinic campus sits several miles east of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downtown lakefront  which continued to decline over the years. Since the late \u00e2\u0080\u009970s  some civic leaders held onto the belief that renovating the outdated underground convention center might be the key to making the city center a destination once again. The political and financial capital to make it happen never materialized. Investing public money in building convention facilities is often a divisive issue. Boosters often say if you build it  they will come; others say the investment rarely pays off. William Bowen  a professor of public administration at Cleveland State University  puts himself in the latter category. Convention center deals typically underperform their projections that spurred their construction  he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the time  the valuation of the impact of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built either doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen  or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t  as a rule  pay back the public coffers \u00e2\u0080\u009d Bowen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borne out by the majority of the research.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement started to change the sense of possibility  and then  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement would put it over the hump  Hagan said. The consensus version of how the development came about begins with Dr. Toby Cosgrove  Cleveland Clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime president. According to  Kennedy   Cosgrove wanted to leverage the clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cachet to revitalize downtown Cleveland. Cosgrove declined multiple interview requests.  Kennedy  said a New York real estate executive who was Cosgrove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient recommended Merchandise Mart and  Kennedy .  Kennedy  said Cosgrove called  him  to discuss the potential for a mart geared toward medical professionals.  Kennedy  said in 2005  he  and another Merchandise Mart official met with Cosgrove and local and state economic officials at the clinic.  Kennedy  said  he  suggested the new medical mart be tied into rebuilding Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aging convention center.",

I wanted to make rogan josh  aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower)  chicken biryani (chicken and rice)  and paneer with palak (spinach). But my mom  like so many Indian mothers I know  has always avoided giving me complete recipes. Even when I visit home and watch her  she somehow manages to divert my attention by  say  dangling in front of my face a gol gappa  a globe of fried wheat flour filled with chickpeas and potatoes and yogurt. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always missing a spice  a cook time  a stove temperature. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never clear if when she says \u00e2\u0080\u009cginger\u00e2\u0080\u009d she means \u00e2\u0080\u009cfresh ginger  about a pinky-size  cut into strips\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cginger powder  a teaspoon or two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or  if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling really casual about a recipe  she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdd the usual spices \u00e2\u0080\u009d a mix of 5 or maybe 10 different spices that might be usual to her but are patently unclear to me. Salt? Does she just mean salt? Worse  her measurements are not based on any contemporary or commonly used metric. A teaspoon  to her  is the size of the white plastic spoon with the snapped-off handle that she uses in all of the containers in her spice drawer that originally came from Dairy Queen when I was 6 or 7 and abandoned a half-eaten Oreo Blizzard. A tablespoon  conversely  is anywhere between two or three of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cteaspoons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A cup is the cup she uses to scoop basmati rice out of the five-gallon plastic tub in the pantry on the bottom shelf. It is unclear where the cup came from  but it is cloudy and cracked and significantly smaller than an actual cup. Every other measurement she has  then  is specific to her grocery store  to her homemade spice mixtures  to her butcher who hands her a hunk of lamb the size of a small toddler  leaving her to break it down into digestible and cookable pieces. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much frozen spinach do I need?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I might ask her  and she will answer  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One block  she says  as if I can go to a grocery store and say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cONE BLOCK OF YOUR FINEST FROZEN SPINACH  SIR.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suspect some of this is intentional. Indian women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mothers  in particular \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hoard some of their recipes  refusing to give them in full. So long as they are the eldest women in their families  they are the gatekeepers for these particular culinary incarnations that exist only in their kitchens. (A cursory Google search for a good chicken biryani recipe yielded ingredients like chicken stock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my mom literally screamed when I suggested this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or curry paste  something that has never once been in her kitchen.) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started to do this too  refusing to give my boyfriend a complete ingredient list  even when I need help cooking  because I refuse to let him in on a secret I have been scratching at for years. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about making herself needed as a mother  or forcing me into coming home and beg for my favorite lotus root  a recipe specific to Kashmir that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never found at a restaurant. Regional differences are lost  the little things my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother did in the kitchen get muddied \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless I ask. And I have been asking  for years  for as long as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been away from home and have been trying to find my mom at the bottom of a 20-quart pot. All of this reduces my cooking to a kind of trial and error. Once  when I tried to make her rogan josh  I ended up adding three times the right amount of cinnamon; my lamb tasted like an angry ginger snap. Two years after that  she casually mentioned that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only supposed to use flat cinnamon sticks  and not the rolled up ones  which apparently makes a fucking difference. When I last visited  she sent me back to my home with frozen rogan josh in my suitcase. Later  when I defrosted and ate it  I picked through it  pulling out any identifiable spices I could find. At the bottom of my bowl was a dark ball the texture of soft wood. I cleaned it off and texted it to my mom with my trademark calm: \u00e2\u0080\u009c?!?!?!?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gave me the Hindi word for it  leaving me to creative googling to figure out what it was. (I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve invested too much to give it up that easy.) Mom swears that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not actively keeping ingredients from me  that she just forgets because cooking is so second-nature to her. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain why sometimes she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add an ingredient to her list for me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a year ago  the rogan josh recipe had coriander powder in it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 later saying something like  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would I ever tell you to put coriander powder in it? Nothing has coriander powder in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now she says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually garam masala  but not the kind you buy in the store (she says this with her particular brand of derision usually reserved for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite\u00e2\u0080\u009d grocery stores) but the kind that she makes at home  fistfuls of unidentifiable brown spices hand-ground with a mortar and pestle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will give you some when you come home \u00e2\u0080\u009d she always says  but she is a liar  because she never actually has. Food has always been my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domain  so maybe it makes sense that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give me her trade secrets just yet.",

This analysis has always been obviously wrong in at least one more way: Titanic is not a fun movie to watch. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escaping from anything so much as putting yourself through an emotional ordeal: a decathlon of passion  dread  terror  numbness  and finally cathartic hope. You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focusing on the girls in the audience  then please \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 die (they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put your faith in a system like a ship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or a government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Auden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing lines in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeptember 1  1939\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities were  his imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means \u00e2\u0080\u0094 still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of just spectacularly destroying one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for us both.",

According to a recent study from Data & Society  47% of internet users aged 15 and older have experienced online harassment or abuse at some point. Thirty-six percent of all respondents reported that they had been harassed directly  meaning they had been threatened  called abusive names  or stalked. When a story goes viral  this experience is amplified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis idea of people coming together within specific affinity groups and behaving in ways that are really good for the \u00e2\u0080\u0098in\u00e2\u0080\u0099 group and terrible for members of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 group [...] there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing new about that \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Whitney M.

Trump has insulted politicians  media organizations  public figures  and private citizens on Twitter  which  in some cases  has incited his supporters to launch social media attacks on the people he singled out. He has spread and amplified skewed information and has tweeted falsehoods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you do when the president is doing the thing that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get average citizens not to do anymore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phillips. Truong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story became a battleground for different factions to debate their own views about the media and politics. While roughly 70% of the 100 most retweeted tweets about her contained insults against her  the media  and/or \"liberals \" a little less than a third of all the mentions from that same sample were trying to defend  Truong  (and a small percentage were not related to the story).",

If you truly wanted to equalize and integrate schools  you would have to. But you can go a step shorter than that. New York City public schools are majority black and Latino. But you can go to any of the suburbs around  and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very heavily white. So in New York and all across the North  you could simply move into an all-white community and go to all-white public schools. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you avoided desegregation. In the South  most school districts were countywide. So you either paid for private school or you dealt with desegregation. In the North  you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. The key difference between the North and the South is for the vast majority of the history of this country  90 percent of all black people lived in the South. The South responds with Jim Crow  by passing laws that restrict the movement of black people. The North doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. It has a very tiny black population. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only once black people start migrating out of the South in the 1900s that the North shows its true ugly racist head.

Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop\u2019s ultimate commodity\u2014inspiration. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha\u2019s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year\u2019s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her \u201creal\u201d self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. \u201cVictim to victory\u201d songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they\u2019re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyonc\u00e9 rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. \u201cI write this shit  baby \u201d Kesha insisted on a recent single. You\u2019re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.

Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it\u2019s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness.

Brooklyn is not the Brooklyn of the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s or \u00e2\u0080\u009990s (so  Lee  keeps reminding us). Mock: On another note  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thankful that they got rid of the rape scene from the movie. I think the transition to dealing with sexual harassment and assault in the streets was the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest material  especially as it bled into Darling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art work  which helped solve some of her financial problems. The personal became political then became personal again. Serwer: I think part of the reason why that subplot is so strong is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on a work called Stop Telling Women to Smile by the artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh  who was also a consultant on the show. Fazlalizadeh put up a series of posters around Brooklyn with similar anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093street harassment messages she drew from women she interviewed about their experiences. Green: Spike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long talked about regretting that rape scene (and as recently as November). I agree  Brentin  that the show did a really good job of making sexual trauma an undercurrent without visually exploiting female characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the street-art campaign to Darling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art student replacing Lil\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kim with herself on the Hard Core album cover for a school assignment. With the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree black female form\u00e2\u0080\u009d as its thematic throughline  the show subtly deals with sex and trauma  complicating the idea of autonomy and who has access to it.",

Zhang: As you know  Novartis disputes the $200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah.  Mitchell : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins  the head of the National Institutes of Health  in which  he  explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017  NIH invested more than $200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers\u2014Novartis  Kite (which will become Gilead)  and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]\u2014are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? Mitchell: Well  we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now  the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis  so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite\u2019s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was $150 000 for treatment  and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to $300 000. When we tried to model  we can\u2019t get over $300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First  they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth $600 000 to $750 000 but they were going to price it lower at $475 000. And second  they said patients who don\u2019t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay.",

But there\u00e2s the separate question of what mixed messages do to short-term foreign-policy goals. Qatar\u00e2s emir said last month his country was a \u00e2thousand times better off\u00e2 without Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf nations imposing the blockade\u00e2suggesting that  if the U.S. wanted to see the split resolved quickly  the goal remains out of reach. And if the U.S. wanted to see Iran\u00e2s role in the Gulf diminished  that too is unlikely; Qatar has now turned to Iran and others for support. * * * Tweet I told Rex Tillerson  our wonderful Secretary of State  that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... \u00e2 Donald J.

She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis character doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through torment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  later said of the role  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u0080\u0099\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098A three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now why you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Better Worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic follows this example. Even if men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively oppressing women  Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things I think people might find interesting and new about this movie: how suspicious  his  own party was of  him   and that it was this moment that turned and defined  him   and defined our history. Sims: Because  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unproven person coming into office  in a lot of ways. Wright:  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trusted.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s made a lot of mistakes.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s had a long parliamentary career;  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in Parliament since  his  20s.  His  policies on women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffrage   his  policy on Indian independence  and what happened in the Gallipoli Campaign [of the First World War] was a complete disaster. The invasion of the Dardanelles was a great idea militarily  but time slipped away from [British forces] and they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act quickly enough. And when it became apparent that things weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to go as planned   he  should have withdrawn  but  his  will forced it forward and caused many deaths. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I mean by will being a detriment as well as a benefit.",

By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time.

Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) \u00e2\u0080\u009c Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should be a little brass sign right here that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098Push \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was one delight after another \u00e2\u0080\u009d Marschall said of his time on Titanic.

So we thought  who better to ask about this than the people who served in uniform and whose service is being honored?

They also exchanged information about how to buy guns online. As with most known cases of Americans travelling to join Islamic State  the internet proved a useful tool for  Hoxha . While it is often tempting to assume that individuals are \u201cradicalized online\u201d through their consumption of propaganda  this is rarely the case. More commonly  the internet allows people to make contacts with and plug themselves into pre-existing  real-world recruitment and radicalization networks. In  Hoxha \u2019s case  the network  he  found would encourage and eventually facilitate  his  travel to Islamic State territory. The court records show that prior to  Hoxha \u2019s departure  David Wright put  him  in touch with another American Islamic State supporter  his uncle Usaamah Rahim  and together they began helping  Hoxha  as  he  prepared to travel in the spring of 2015. The two men raised money for  Hoxha \u2019s plane ticket to Istanbul by selling Rahim\u2019s laptop on Craigslist.  Hoxha  departed for Istanbul on April 6.

And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an artist. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to have his heart soar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his ship  man. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great patriarch of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He can fully experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio reflected in 2004. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the beginning  it was clear Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 staying on the big screen even after it was released on video \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion. In a March 1998 article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFan Sinks into Titanic Obsession \u00e2\u0080\u009d the Associated Press reported that a 12-year-old girl named Gloria had gone to see Titanic  at the only movie theater in the town of Castelfranco Emilia  Italy  every single night since its release  and that she would go on watching it until she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anymore. She had seen it 50 times so far and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saved her favorite seat for her every night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack is cuter than Leo \u00e2\u0080\u009d Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.",

The scene has been memed over and over again  tracing back to old message boards  the underbelly of the early internet. It also lives on through fan art and tweets and Vines (RIP)  and it was parodied on Family Guy  on which Banks was portrayed as a model who loses her temper and transforms into a lizard  eating one of the contestants.

Some of his appetites  at least  had waned\u2026.With a pencil neck and a sagging jacket he clambered gamely onto the stage after Hillary\u2019s acceptance speech and played happily with the red balloons that fell from the ceiling. When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters\u2019 minds. \u2026Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  Juanita Broaddrick  reported that when  she  was a volunteer on one of  his  gubernatorial campaigns   she  had arranged to meet  him  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   he  had changed the location to  her  room in the hotel  where  she  says  he  very violently raped  her .  She  said  she  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today\u2019s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing\u2014eager\u2014to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.",

Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. \u201cDid I get it right?\u201d she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. \u201cYes you did \u201d her grandmother responds.

It\u2019s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne \u2019s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested \u201cborderline positive\u201d for lupus.  She \u2019s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.  Fibromyalgia  appears to make that problem worse  and being a pop star in chronic pain certainly doesn\u2019t seem easy.

Trump\u00e2s feud with Khan fits his pattern of interaction with the London mayor  but his recent put-down of Theresa May was more surprising. It began when  late last month   Trump  retweeted anti-Muslim videos shared by a British far-right group. May said the president was \u00e2wrong\u00e2 to have shared the videos  which purported to show Muslims committing violent acts  and which have dubious provenance or have been debunked.  Trump  tweeted that  her  efforts might be better spent preventing \u00e2radical Islamic terrorism\u00e2 in the U.K. Upshot Khan is one of the most popular political figures in the U.K. May not so much. But  Trump  is so disliked within the country that Brits were united in outrage against  his  tweets and  his  rebuke of May. Calls for Trump\u00e2s planned state visit to the U.K. to be canceled grew in the wake of the tweets. The lasting damage this particular episode has on U.S.-U.K. relations will likely be small  since  feuds aside  the \u00e2special relationship\u00e2 continues to serve both countries\u00e2 interests. Still  that relationship has long been more important to the U.K. than to the U.S. Trump\u00e2s tweets make that even more apparent. * * * Tweet During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology.

But  he \u00e2s made similar remarks about Germany and France  linking their intake of refugees and migrants to terrorism. Europe more broadly is grappling with the challenge of integrating large numbers of migrants and refugees  and it\u00e2s an issue that has helped fuel far-right parties in several countries. But this year many European governments  including Sweden  have tightened immigration rules  and far-right parties are once again slipping in the polls. Upshot Trump hasn\u00e2t tweeted about Sweden since February. In April  Sweden suffered what the Times described as its \u00e2worst terrorist attack in decades\u00e2 when a driver plowed his truck into pedestrians in Stockholm; the man who admitted carrying out the attack was an Uzbek national whose asylum application had been rejected the previous year. * * * Tweet Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\" statement.

Such top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection\u2014or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design\u2014the Resistor Case  I call it\u2014is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the \u201cIKEA effect\u201d to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I\u2019m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use.

And although Democrats must defend far more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094including several in states that Donald Trump won\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incumbents are currently running for reelection. The retirements of Corker and Flake  along with a Democratic victory in December\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special election in Alabama  give Democrats an outside chance at retaking the Senate majority. In the House  they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to pick up 24 seats  and the more Republicans retire in districts that  Hillary Clinton  carried last year  the more the GOP majority is at risk. Data sources: Each district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential-election results are from the Daily Kos. House and Senate election results are from the Associated Press.",

Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stay the No. 1 movie in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically  as the final budget reflected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $32 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?",

By the time my ancestor set sail on the Mayflower  Europeans had been visiting New England for more than a hundred years. English  French  Italian  Spanish  and Portuguese mariners regularly plied the coastline  trading what they could  occasionally kidnapping the inhabitants for slaves. New England  the Europeans saw  was thickly settled and well defended. In 1605 and 1606 Samuel de Champlain visited Cape Cod  hoping to establish a French base.  He  abandoned the idea. Too many people already lived there. A year later Sir Ferdinando Gorges\u00e2\u0080\u0094British despite  his  name\u00e2\u0080\u0094tried to establish an English community in southern Maine. It had more founders than Plymouth and seems to have been better organized. Confronted by numerous well-armed local Indians  the settlers abandoned the project within months. The Indians at Plymouth would surely have been an equal obstacle to my ancestor and his ramshackle expedition had disease not intervened. Faced with such stories  historians have long wondered how many people lived in the Americas at the time of contact. \"Debated since Columbus attempted a partial census on Hispaniola in 1496 \" William Denevan has written  this \"remains one of the great inquiries of history.\" (In 1976 Denevan assembled and edited an entire book on the subject  The Native Population of the Americas in 1492.) The first scholarly estimate of the indigenous population was made in 1910 by James Mooney  a distinguished ethnographer at the Smithsonian Institution. Combing through old documents  he concluded that in 1491 North America had 1.15 million inhabitants. Mooney's glittering reputation ensured that most subsequent researchers accepted his figure uncritically.",

Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State\u2019s\u2019 mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype\u2019s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State\u2019s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that na\u00efve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that \u201cif you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won\u2019t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.\u201d",

To gentrify a neighborhood also involves quieting it down. The desire for sonic control in and around the home is prioritized above the social fabric of the city  a practice exemplified by the targeting of arts and music venues that are cited as being partially responsible for neighborhood revival in the first place. In her book Beyond Unwanted Sound  Marie Thompson describes an example from the industrial area of Ouseburn Valley in the United Kingdom. The region had become a hotbed of music and the arts partly because there were few residences to disturb. Eventually  several venues closed after repeated run-ins with the law due to noise complaints. These complaints came not from concerned locals  but from wealthy newcomers buying into new developments built explicitly to capitalize on the area\u2019s vibrant nightlife. The noise that does the most harm doesn\u2019t come from clubs and house parties\u2014the causes of many garden-variety noise complaints and violations. Ironically   Rice  did get something right in  her  crusade: Industrial noise poses the worst problem  although individual workers were not to blame for it  as  Rice  had also concluded. The two largest sources of environmental noise are transportation and industrial activity. The cars for which early noise ordinances helped clear the streets have amplified that noise to a universal  inescapable level. Industrial areas  often designated for land close to the poorest nonwhite areas in a city  are even worse.",

Omata \u2019s analog appearance also disguises all the electronics that make  it  work. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell that  it \u2019s a computer on the inside \u201d Bleecker says. \u201cPeople think  it  needs to be tethered to the bike.\u201d Instead  a microcontroller  GPS sensor  barometer  and a set of motors make it work. After a ride   Omata  can be wired to a computer or wirelessly connected to a smartphone to download the same sort of data that its more obviously digital competitors make available: performance  distance  mapping  and so on. \u201cOur ambition isn\u2019t to get rid of the computation \u201d Bleecker explains  \u201cbut to hide it.\u201d * * * These days  people try to hide computers by escaping from them  like I escape to my lawn. The machines \u201chide\u201d inside offices or jacket pockets so their owners can accomplish other goals. In some cases  the drive to get away from computers degenerates into wistfulness. The word \u201canalog\u201d has come to indicate retro nostalgia first  a way of resisting or even abandoning bits in favor of atoms. Certainly  Omata risks such accusation. But the line separating analog and digital isn\u2019t as clean as popular usage makes it seem. Writing in The New York Times in 2015  Rob Walker observed an \u201canalog fever\u201d in contemporary culture. A counterrevolution to the digital revolution. Walker cites the rise of vinyl records and the decline of ebook sales in favor of print as evidence of this fever. It sounds right to modern ears. But strictly speaking  simply not being a computer doesn\u2019t make something analog. Analog devices represent information with a continuously variable portrayal of that information. They create an analogous depiction of a source signal in physical form. A mechanical watch  for example  measures the passage of time with a set of hands  driven by a loaded spring  that traverse the watch face. In the case of a bicycle  as Newman suggests  the crankcase moves the bike analogously to the rider\u2019s physical exertion. Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. By contrast  digital devices sample a stream of activity at regular intervals  converting those measures into discrete values for manipulation by an electronic device. Since computers are the machines that usually sense  store  and manipulate the resulting digital signals  \u201cdigital\u201d has come to refer to anything that makes use of computer technology. In turn  analog started meaning \u201cnot involving computers\u201d rather than continuously representing a signal with a physical quantity.",

In October 2015  a video was released by the Islamic State of a purported American brutally beheading a Kurdish peshmerga soldier. The 15-minute video  shot from multiple camera angles  features four individuals dressed in black and standing behind captured Kurdish soldiers. Its subject speaks with the same accent and inflection as  Hoxha  in the May 2017 release. Multiple law-enforcement officials told us that the individual who says he is \u201cdelivering a message to Obama\u201d and then commits the first execution is  Hoxha . If officially confirmed  it would be the first case of an American Islamic State member beheading someone in a propaganda video. * * * Little is known about  Hoxha \u2019s personal background. A search for  his  online activity finds a defunct Twitter account bearing  his  name  which interacted with other Islamic State supporters  as well as detractors. In October 2014  for example  the account engaged in conversation with the State Department\u2019s \u201cThink Again Turn Away\u201d account  which at the time was trying to counter Islamic State messaging on the platform. He was actually not the first American jihadi to do so. Around the same time  a 17-year-old  Ali Amin  was also trolling the State Department Twitter account. A short time later  he was arrested and ultimately sentenced to 11 years for encouraging his high school friend to join the Islamic State.",

The Fox News host Sean Hannity  is facing heat after several brands pulled their ads from  his  show. A wave of advertisers announced they would pull spots from \"Hannity\" following  the host 's interview on Friday with Roy Moore in which they discussed allegations that Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old and pursued relationships with other teenagers when he was in his 30s. Some media observers have noted that Hannity directly asked about the allegations. But critics say Hannity went too easy on Moore \u2014 whom he supported in the Alabama Senate primary \u2014 saying he appeared to agree with a characterization of some of the conduct as \"consensual.\" Amid the left-wing media watchdog Media Matters urging sponsors to pull ads  Keurig  Realtor.com  Eloquii  23andMe  Nature's Bounty  and E-Trade all announced over the weekend that they had no plans to advertise on Hannity's Fox News show. More recently  brands such as Mercedes-Benz have jumped on the bandwagon  even as others such as MyPillow remain unfazed. Brands distancing themselves from politically or otherwise sensitive issues is nothing new. Several big-name advertisers were conspicuously absent from Megyn Kelly's interview in June with Alex Jones  the right-wing provocateur and conspiracy-monger. Similarly  in April  BMW  Mitsubishi  Hyundai  and Lexus were among the brands that pulled their ads from \"The O'Reilly Factor\" amid a wave of sexual-harassment allegations against its host  Bill O'Reilly. There has also been increasing consumer backlash to brands taking positions. But these emotional reactions are unprecedented  according to Canvs  a company that measures viewers' qualitative responses to content. It looks at all the spoken words about shows across social media and maps viewers' reactions with a range of 42 emotions. \"Unlike most emotional conversations about TV  brands have been raised to the forefront of the discussion surrounding ' Hannity  '\" a Canvs analyst told Business Insider. \"These brand-driven viewer emotional reactions are really unprecedented when you look at any show on TV.\" Still   Hannity  has seen  his  ratings jump since Fox News moved  him  to a different time slot last month.  He  was already one of the highest-rated personalities in cable news.  He  has also weathered previous boycott calls by Media Matters  partially by rallying  his  viewers and supporters  who started a #BoycottKeurig campaign over the weekend and shared videos of themselves destroying the coffee machines. On Monday  Realtor.com deleted an initial tweet about pulling the ads  and Keurig's CEO apologized for \"taking sides.\" \"The action is key because that is what will have a financial effect on  Hannity 's show  not the messaging that companies use \" said Angelo Carusone  the president of Media Matters. Carusone added that he was surprised that Realtor.com made a statement at all  considering the company is owned by Fox News' chairman  Rupert Murdoch. Business Insider asked several other brands who have advertised on  Hannity 's show over the past few months about their stances and whether they plan to do so in the future.

On a bike. So what? And yet  somehow  the result feels uncommon. The smartphone in my pocket buzzes\u2014a text message or a Slack notification or who knows what else\u2014and I remember why. Today  computers wrest people from activities outside the computer to work or play back inside them. But  the Omata  is pushing me toward something else.  It \u2019s nudging me to to focus on the non-computational activity I\u2019m participating in  rather than reminding me of all the other  digital ones I might choose instead. What if more computers had that same ambition? * * * \u201cRiding a bike\u2014 it \u2019s a very analog experience.\u201d Rhys Newman   Omata\u2019s  CEO  speaks with a Welsh accent that makes the matter sound profound  almost spiritual. \u201c It \u2019s man harnessing the machine in an analogous way to the effort of his body.\u201d Not a spiritual thing after all  but a corporeal one. Using technology to assist with a worldly goal  rather than to displace it. Newman and his cofounder and chief technology officer  Julian Bleecker  met while working at Nokia. They were part of a secretive team at the company\u2019s \u201cEveryday Adventure\u201d group in Los Angeles  where the two designed outdoor products  including a camera and a sports tracker. Once the world\u2019s biggest mobile-handset manufacturer  Nokia shed 93 percent of its value between 2000 and 2013  when Microsoft acquired its beleaguered mobile-devices division. The company was ill-prepared for the smartphone. Between 2000 and 2007  it had been focused on reducing handset size and cost while increasing battery efficiency. These were phones for the everyperson  after all  not executive tethers like the BlackBerry. When the iPhone proved that approach to be exactly wrong  Nokia raced to follow Apple\u2019s (and then Samsung\u2019s) lead: devices with more connectivity  bigger screens  and better cameras. Maximizing attention was now the goal  rather than facilitating communication. Everywhere  computers are screaming at you: \u201cHere I am! I am a computer!\u201d Newman and Bleecker\u2019s project spun up near Nokia\u2019s nadir. Desperate to help reverse course  the L.A. group hoped to find a novel angle on a connected camera. The two looked to their own favorite: Leica  the storied German range-finder manufacturer. Leica\u2019s flagship line  the M  got a digital sensor in 2006  but everything else about it remains mechanical. The photographer still adjusts focus and aperture by hand. For this reason  operating a Leica requires deliberateness  making the process of image creation an end as much as a means. That deliberateness would eventually show up in the Omata  which promises a \u201cdeeper connection to the ride itself.\u201d",
