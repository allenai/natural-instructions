    "Definition": "You are given a question on electrical engineering. Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. You are also given 4 answer options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"), out of which only one is correct. You need to answer the question by selecting the correct option. You should only answer with the choice letter, not the whole answer.",
