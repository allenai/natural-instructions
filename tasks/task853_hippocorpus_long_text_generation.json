        "Read the given summary of events, and write a longer story which covers everything described in the summary. The story you write should be longer than the summary you read, but should not repeat itself. The story should be made up of sentences which form a cohesive and logical sequence of events, and should be long enough to fill two or more paragraphs. Do not omit any details which were given by the summary. Make the story such that the summary is an accurate characterization of the paragraphs you write. Adding extra details in your story which are not mentioned in the summary is okay as long as they don't contradict anything in the summary."

            "input": "My boyfriend and I went to a concert together and had a great time. We met some of my friends there and really enjoyed ourselves watching the sunset.",
            "output": "The day started perfectly, with a great drive up to Denver for the show. Me and my boyfriend didn't hit any traffic on the way to Red Rocks, and the weather was beautiful. We met up with my friends at the show, near the top of the theater, and laid down a blanket. The opener came on, and we danced our butts off to the banjoes and mandolins that were playing on-stage. We were so happy to be there. That's when the sunset started. It was so beautiful. The sky was a pastel pink and was beautiful to watch. That's when Phil Lesh came on, and I just about died. It was the happiest moment of my life, seeing him after almost a decade of not seeing him. I was so happy to be there, with my friends and my love. There was nothing that could top that night. We drove home to a sky full of stars and stopped at an overlook to look up at them. I love this place I live. And I love live music. I was so happy.",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story which was written fills a few paragraphs, and covers everything listed by the summary. It is much longer than the summary, but is not redundant and does not repeat itself. It describes a cohesive sequence of events, from which a person could reasonably glean the details by reading the provided summary. Additionally, nothing in the story contradicts the summary."

            "output": "It seems just like yesterday but today makes five months ago it happened. I had been watching my phone like an owl for the past week. I was waiting for a work related call that my team was waiting for to close a important deal. It wasnt the call I expected though. It was for my sister was in labor with the twins. My sister is only 7 months pregnant. I got the call shortly after arriving at work. Just as fast I was back out the door and on my way to the hospital. When I arrived my sister had just delivered and I just was in awe. Even though they were a bit small they were mighty. They were the most precious things I had ever seen. I held my niece and nephew and couldnt stop crying. Seeing the tears of joy my sister had was the most warming thing. I am a mother myself but this was the first time for my sister. It was a moment that we could bond and share the warmth of motherhood. I will never forget the look on my brother in law's face as he absorbed the feeling of being father for the first time. His tears moved the room to tears. It was the most surreal and beautiful moment. The moment had so much of an impact because I can remember becoming a mother for the first time. I am a single mother who is currently enrolled in RN school looking to finish next year. I would do a survey like this again in the future.",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story generated sufficiently covers every detail given by the summary. It is also good because it is a longer story which spans multiple paragraphs and doesn't repeat itself. It's also okay that it adds some extra details which weren't in the summary; this makes it a better story to read and feel more natural."

I always look at the caller ID now on my phone, just in case. if I owe them money I don't want to answer. Everyday it feels like I made a mistake by letting myself spend all my money. I have to work extra hours but they won't give me any. So the bills just keep piling up and I need to search around for a second job. I barely have enough time for the first one. I really should have thought about what would have happened in advance.",
            "explanation": "This is an example of a story which does not fit the given summary. The summary details a completely different set of events than what is described by the story. The story and the summary are about different things entirely. To make the story be a good example, it should be rewritten to be a story about going to Acadia National Park and almost crashing the car, like the summary describes."

            "explanation": "This is an example of a story which is a bad expansion of the given summary because it simply repeats the summary over and over again. Instead, the story should be a couple paragraphs of unique sentences describing going to the zoo, how hot it was, and seeing each of the animals described in the summary."

            "output": "It didn't seem we were even doing anything illegal. Sure, we had rolled through a stop sign, but that normally is just a slap on the wrist. A slap on the wrist--if not, for that empty bag of marijuana in the passenger's side door panels we had forgotten about. 'Do you agree to a search?' the officer asked. Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here. Then he knocked a book out of the door panel and out emerged an empty bag of marijuana with a few flakes clinging to the interior of it. It may have been there for three, five years, who even knows? What we do know, is that was enough to put my buddy, the driver, in court the next morning.",
            "explanation": "This is an example of a story which is bad because it misses the part of the summary at the end, where they are lucky because things turn out okay. In the story, the events end at the friend going to court. We can't tell from the story that things turned out okay, like the summary stated. To make this a good example, a happy ending where the friend gets out of trouble is needed."

                "It was a pretty cold day for the summertime, couldn't have been more than 60 degrees out when I first stepped outside of my house and towards the car. I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert. We were going to be late to the movie if we didn't leave soon so I quickly grabbed whatever coffee had been finished and rushed out the door having a completely black cup of joe that I didn't even want anymore. My friend was waiting for me at her house when I picked her up and was a bit annoyed that I was late, but I didn't think much of it. Now this is the part that really, really stuck out to me. Right as she got into the car, her daughter quickly ran outside and called her back in. When she came back out she was bright red and told me that she couldn't go, that she had to stay home and didn't want to explain but I was adamant and so she did. Apparently the babysitter couldn't make it in time and so it was all a bust, but instead of letting her feel bad I drove home real quick and picked up a blu-ray of a movie that I figured she would enjoy and drove back to her house. At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me. Anyways, once this was all over instead of leaving she offered for me to stay for dinner and this is the first time I would ever have a meal with her alone as her daughter took a nap right after eating a few minutes earlier. This is so memorable for me because it was the first experience that I had in a romantic setting with this woman who I am now currently dating and I'll never forget it."

My best friend and I chatted about how today was going to be life-changing. I was super excited for her and her husband-to-be. The time came for the ceremony and I walked down the aisle before my best friend. I watched her walk down and had to hold back tears and ugly crying. I took her bouquet when she took the hand of her soon to be future husband. I listened to their vows and I remember how happy they both were. The time came to exchange rings and say \"I do.\" I handed her her new husband's wedding band and it was a very special moment for all of us. It was the most beautiful wedding I have ever been to."

                "I quit my job two months ago now, after being so short-staffed and overworked that serious safety issues began to happen. Even though safety issues began to happen more and more, our supervisor simply kept piling on more work. Her boss told her it wasn't important and we could skip doing it, but my supervisor wanted to impress everyone and be \"number 1\" so she ignored all advice. Whispers began behind her back, the other pharmacists began to worry about their licenses but the pressure just kept mounting. I found the wrong pills in a bottle on the shelf and my supervisor got mad at me, even though I had not filled from that bottle at all that week. Nothing was ever mentioned again and I began to lie awake at 3 in the morning wondering if the wrong medication had gone out unnoticed before or since. This income was so important to my family, the job was so important to my self-worth but I knew if anything happened I would be liable no matter who was truly at fault. My job had been toxic to begin with, my supervisor was abusive and infamous in our company for being a nasty person. My coworkers trained me by yelling at me and then arguing and ranting with each other in Spanish about me. But I persisted, I did not want to let them win. Every morning I hoped I would get in a car wreck serious enough that I could not work for the foreseeable future. I snapped at my husband, I snapped at my child. Every moment not spent at work was filled with crushing dread that I would have to go back in a few hours. My marriage suffered greatly, my self-esteem was trashed. Yet still I kept on. But that one little tablet of Tramadol was enough to snap me out of it. I was terrified, someone with over a decade of experience had mistakenly put a controlled substance into a bottle of blood pressure medication. And no one caught it. The counts of the controlled medication done every day weren't off? That seemed odd to me, every tablet of those is so tightly accounted for that someone either counted wrong or they noticed but didn't have time to deal with the paperwork so they brushed it aside. How many times had it happened before? Why was I being blamed? These questions ate at me and ate at me until I realized I was killing myself for a job that would throw me under the bus even knowing criminal charges could be brought against me when I didn't do anything wrong. So I quit even though now we are relying on food banks and credit to make do."

I remember blacking out on the surface, my mind overwhelmed with panic. But then I remember falling into a comfortable embrace of nothingness. It was so eternally peaceful. I thought to myself, \"this is it\", I am dead. But I felt a presence echo through me, so deeply that my whole body shook. It said one thing only - \"NO\".  I woke up a day later in the hospital. I was told I was saved by another surfer who saw me drowning. Even after 26 months I still dream about it, the drowning, the acceptance of death, and the...something else out there. The divine something telling me \"no.\" It's not your time. I feel truly blessed and protected. I now search for the reason why I was saved by god. There must be a reason why I was pulled back."

As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that. As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale."

He finally apologized, then we went home to rest before the big day! The day of the wedding I woke up early because I couldn't sleep from excitement! I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got out photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to hide inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside. Luckily, the weather cleared shortly and we were able to get everything set up again and the ceremony started. It was beautiful, with a rainbow overhead and the bright sun coming out.

Celia is the best, too. She made space for all of my belongings and has been being so kind and welcoming. We luckily got finished moving things in pretty fast so after a shower and a little bit of time to relax, Celia offered to take me out around the neighborhood. It was so new and different but I love how everything felt. We stopped in at some cool shops and then went for an early dinner at a nice restaurant that's just down the street from our place. I can't believe that its really \"our place\" now! Its so exciting. I just can't wait to see where our future is headed from here. After such a busy day though right now its just time to get some rest."

Now that our children are growing up, we needed more bedrooms. We tried to make the current situation work as we are very attached to this first house. It was a difficult decision, but after much deliberation we decided to sell it. This happened about four months ago. We are excited about the new house we are moving into but miss the nostalgic touches of where we reared our children in their younger days. We miss the apple tree outside that we planted ourselves when we first moved in. We miss the marks on the wall where we recorded their height as they grew up. But we try and look forward to the new memories we will be creating in this new home and set our sights on the future. This house has a dining nook where we can imagine many family pizza and movie nights going forward. It also has a fire pit that we can imagine the kids will enjoy having their friends over at as they grow older. It is important to never grow to attached to worldly things as nothing lasts. It is also important to remember that although nothing lasts, nothing is lost. The older I grow the more I realize what this truly means to me."

                "Now it was time to figure out what to do after college. I had to start a job hunt. I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you’ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores. Despite being the youngest employee other employees were very friendly. Whenever i need help they were ready to help me out. After three moths i was promoted to higher position and my salary also increased since i was very hardworking and focused. Life was starting to feel better i had to move from my parents house and rent my apartment,i started also paying my bills is not that easy but i had to struggle and do other par time jobs. I had to also save in order for me to do other courses and grow my career."

                "We went on a fishing trip in south florida. My mother told me not to take her car as it wasn't ready for the road we didn't listen. Me and my boyfriend and my two brothers were all stuffed in this sedan with our new puppy. We made our way down the highway about 40 miles (It was a 180 mile trip) when my boyfriend points out the heat gauge is going up. Shortly after that the car begins to stall. This is where everything takes a turn. We pull off to the side of the highway in order to check the car. It turns out to be a radiator problem and with no towns for 20 miles in any direction were in trouble. So we are all sitting in the car trying to avoid the heat when we notice \"has anyone see the puppy?\". This is when things get even worse we couldn't find our puppy we thought she might of ran off into the everglades to the right of us so we start going in the mud looking around. We called her name shaked a box of treats and still can't find her. Then my brother in the car calls us all over and low and behold there's the puppy. She was hiding in between the seats and the trunk to stay cool and somehow she found her way in a spot where none of us could see her! This brings up our moral while we wait for triple a that my grandma had called for us. In the end we never did get to go on that trip with the puppy but we all made it out okay and for what it was it's a memorable little road trip for us."

I initially was going to say no, but then he told me that it was a Rag Doll kitty, and I had read a lot about how awesome that breed of cat is. The fact that it was a pure bred cat changed my mind as to whether we should get it. My first two cats are rescues, from a kill shelter and from a vet's office, I told myself I had saved two already and I can give this one a good home too. I told him yes, then we had to almost a month for her to be ready to come to our house. When my ex finally brought her over I had no idea how quickly I would fall in love with her. She's the cutest, fluffiest, little kitty ever, and her personality is so easy to like. She's sweet and cuddly, purrs as soon as you touch her or pick her up, and she looks so happy to be pet. She's also super playful, pick up a toy and she comes running and pounces on it, her favorite toys have feathers on them. She runs and jumps through the air so comically that you can't help but laugh at her antics. She's made a huge impact in my home, the other two kitties have been very accepting of her, after the first day hissings. I love my first two cats to pieces, but neither one of them is a lap kitty. New kitty loves to curl up on my lap and be pet. It makes me so happy to have a kitty that likes to snuggle and be close. I'm very happy that I now have three cats in my home, so is my son, as he likes to say he's a crazy cat boy."

Towards the third day, the pain was intense and the doctor recommended I check into the hospital. As I settled in, the nurses recommended I get an epidural to help manage the pain. As I waited on the epidural, they suddenly ordered an ultrasound. It scared me a little. Was something wrong? Everything looked fine on the screen, to me. When the doctor came in, he gave me the news. My baby had turned from head down to transverse and there wasn't time to try to turn him. The baby monitor showed signs of distress. I had no choice but to have an emergency c-section. They put me to sleep and when I woke up, my husband told me our son was beautiful. I couldn't wait to hold him!

About six weeks ago, we took her to the ER with what we thought was a mild issue. It was not mild. Her illness went a sudden and steep decline. When I went to visit my mother this week, I heard her yelling before I entered her hospital room. She did not focus on me when I entered the room and she looked terrified. She kept repeating the same nonsense phrase over and over again. Of course, I wanted to do something to comfort her. She seemed fairly unreachable. I finally went to ask for her nurse to come so that we could see if there was a medical intervention that might comfort her. My mother's doctor came to the room and explained that she had been unsettled the previous evening, so she was given a medication. As a result of the medication, she slept last night, all day today, and had recently woke with hallucinations. I am generally a stoic person, but while the doctor was talking, I began crying. I could not seem to stop. I cried during my entire drive home. I thought that I had become desensitized to my mother's health decline, but I found at that moment that I could not handle her clearly suffering. The hospital is steering clear of the medicine that gave her the hallucinations, so I will hopefully not see my mother looking that terrified again."

He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were. As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes. By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake. When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks. By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake. George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan. But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake. To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake. Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely. After all the drama, we went back to the Gazabo and continued saying our vows. Our wedding day was a good day overall although, it was not what I expected."

                "I've been dealing with a chronic, \"incurable\" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, \"New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese\" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic."

It is rather cheap compared to buying a 20 dollar bottle in the store. It costs me about one to two dollars to make a 30ml bottle of vape liquid. I also find it pretty healthier compared to smoking cigarettes as, i know what i'm vaping. It's only four ingredients (PF, VG, nicotine, and concentrated flavor) compared to whatever is inside cigarettes. Not only does mixing up a batch of this stuff save me time and money, i enjoy doing it. I was just so surprised that i haven't heard of other people doing the DIY ejuice making. So, this was a striking realization. It's fun to browse all the flavors that you can mix/make. Now i know why there are so many vape shops opening everywhere, it's because people are buying these 20 dollar bottles and it's highly profitable to the owners but, little do the the customers know it's just a simple blend of 4 ingredients. Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycol, Nicotine, and Artificial flavoring. Now i don't know about you but, i think that sounds much more healthier in comparison to standard cigarettes. These days you never know what kind of stuff is put into cigarettes. I once heard there was rocket fuel added."

The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours. We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing. We could complain, but we were just so relieved to be inside and out of the heat. Later, we found humor in the conditions of the food we ordered. This is a found memory for me because I do not often get to spend time with my future mother in law, so it was nice to have time to bond."

Of course we accepted and we looked at each other when we got home and wondered what supplies we might need. We had no idea what to bring nor what to expect. So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives. We cherish our friends even more now and next time will be prepared to tackle the campsite."

It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around and yet we live in deprivation. I learned about it after I watched a video on it. It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call \"weeds\" are actually nutritious and delicious plants. I have grown alot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust has gone up. It has been a great experience. I would not trade what I learned for anything."

We got out to investigate because there are no buildings or facilities in that part of town. Just when we got out we saw a disc shaped object lift off from where the lights were shining. We couldn't believe what we saw and quickly took out our phones to capture the moment. The object kicked up wind as it took to the air but their was an eerie silence emitting from it. It hovered in the air for about thirty seconds before jetting off over the horizon at speeds that don't seem possible. The wind died back down as the UFO left our sight. We all just stood in disbelieve at what we witnessed. We uploaded the video to social media and my friend managed to stream a bit of the ship live on Instagram. The footage garnered so much attention and views from people all around the world. Many people in the comments thought it was a hoax but we told them that it was all real. Eventually the videos were all taken down from all of our pages. It seems some people don't want the truth to come out just yet."

Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things. Students today are have lived their entire lives in the digital age. When there is something to know, we use our cells phones to search for the answer. That's how we did the work, it can't be written down. If the answer is correct, that all you need. Well, Mr. Bolton kept taking off points for not showing the work, and by Thanksgiving, my average in the class was 47! Since I have always been an honor student, I know the problem was Mr. Bolton, not me. So I told Mom about it. She called the Principal, and got me transferred to another class."

                "Less than a month ago, I moved into my first apartment. I had mostly lived with my parents my entire life, except for a short time in college. My boyfriend and I had been preparing to move for a few months, and waited for the call each month from the landlord who would tell us when an apartment became available. Finally, that call came in August that we could move into an open apartment in September. Each day leading up to the move, I'd either think about what I needed to pack or pack a few things in boxes. There wasn't much of an urgency until the day before. Things didn't seem real until moving day. I woke up at 8 a.m. so I could meet the landlord at 9:30 a.m. It was extremely nerve-racking since the process was new to me. I arrived before my boyfriend and waited on the lobby couch. I spent the next ten minutes texting my friends and family. My boyfriend finally entered the room and I was relieved. We began signing papers and getting all of that sorted out. We both were eager to finish that task so we could start the apartment walkthrough. My first time walking into the apartment was surreal. I couldn't believe that I would be living with my boyfriend of two years and away from my parents. I looked around at the large space and still couldn’t fathom that that was my new home. I waited for it to sink in. The apartment had that \"new\" apartment smell of cleaning materials. It was so empty at first, even with all the boxes and furniture. I'm still getting settled in. The only thing missing is my dog, who is still living with my family and I miss her dearly. I visit her a few times a week. We'll have her here with us as soon as we pay the very expensive pet deposit, and then I think things will feel more complete."

I remember I told him that we needed to talk, and asked him to give me a call when he got done with work. I sat in my car in the Target parking lot waiting for his call for a couple hours. I like to have difficult conversations in my car, because it feels intimate, but then I have the option to drive and clear my head. My stomach dropped when my music cut out and saw his name on the phone screen. We small talked for a few minutes, and the conversation felt strained/off on both our sides. I finally let him know the reason I wanted to talk is because I just couldn't do this anymore. I had spent so much time recently being unhappy and emotional, and I didn't see a pathway out of that for us. There was a lot of silence and \"I wasn't expecting this\". He acknowledged that he hadn't been listening to what I told him I wanted and needed, so he was beating himself up and blaming himself. We both cried, a lot on the call. I tried to reassure him that I respected him and didn't have any bad feelings toward him, it's just a relationship wasn't working for us. He was so kind and had so many nice things to say to me, that in that moment I wondered if I was doing the right thing. The whole conversation was so emotional and I'll never forget hanging up that phone, and feeling a weight being lifted off me. I did the right thing, for both of us."

                "This past week I had an interesting out of the ordinary event that occurred. I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. At this point a car turned onto the street and pulled into it's driveway, I thought It would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out they new the dog and pointed me to the home where it's family is and other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night everything went well and I was able to reunite the dog with its family."

After that, we went to Kentucky Kingdom. It was a small park, but had some nice coasters. Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open. Because of this, we left really early to get to our next destination, Dollywood. Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm. Instead, we continued on to Carowinds, and got to ride Fury 325, which is now my second favorite coaster. We spent two days in Charlotte, where Carowinds is, and then headed to Virginia to go to Kings Dominion. The park was amazing. We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers. After this, we headed to Philadelphia to enjoy the city itself, with no theme parks. Our final stop was in Toronto, where we enjoyed the city, and a great theme park, called Canada's Wonderland. The most memorable part of the Honeymoon was probably the first park. It was so good and we had the rush of the vacation just beginning."

Even though it's been 6 months since that day I still can't stop thinking about it. A couple lived right down the road and they resemble my parents a lot. I heard some chatter on the street that they were both involved with a local gang. Evidently, they stole a phone and purse from the scene and their child has been carrying the purse around. I contacted to police and explained what I had heard on the block and they decide to visit this home. Upon arriving they were able to find the purse laying on a lawn chair and some other personal items that belonged to the victims. They arrested the couple and released my family. We are thinking about suing the county for all the distress they have caused my family. I guess we will have to wait and see what happens at trial. The couple had to move out of the rental house while they were in jail. I'm still stunned that this happened! What would have happened if I didn't find this information out? I could not imagine my parents staying in jail and being tried for a crime they did not commit."

She was having a normal day on the day she passed away. She had a meeting with someone from her church that morning. She went outside to show her friend her garden and then her friend left. She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm. We had video footage from security cameras to show us exactly what happened. She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee. She braced herself temporarily before falling to the ground completely. My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance. She was basically on life support from that time until she passed away about 8 hours later. It has been 5 months since it happened and it still seems so surreal. I miss her smile and I miss her laugh. She had the best laugh! It will be difficult when our family gets together for the holidays this year but we will pull together and honor her in the best way possible."

I called the credit card company that the report said the credit cards were with to report fraud. The credit card company then told me payments have been made, which means it probably was not someone random and to check with family and friends first. After this, I then discovered that it was my own parent who had opened two credit cards in my name and maxed them out. I was so upset and in shock. I felt betrayed, frustrated, upset, and like I didn't know who to trust anymore. i could not believe a parent would do this to their own child. I was then made to feel guilt tripped over it and that I should own it. I forced them to figure out a way to pay it off in a certain time frame. I am unsure how they managed that, but they did. I had to threaten them with legal action if it was not paid by the given date. Fortunately, it did not come to this."

                "This event is about my trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my best friends. Three weeks ago I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight, and met met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet lagged since she came from the United States but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities, but regardless, I found them very relaxing. This trip was amazing overall, I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends. I hadn't seen her for almost a year so it was really great to catch up and kind of share with her a little bit of my chaotic life of when I was working in Europe."

The Bahamas is comprised of 700 islands and over 2,000 rocks and cays, sprinkled over 100,000 square miles of ocean. The archipelago is an ecological oasis, boasting the clearest water on the planet. we can see our toes as easily as you can the world’s third largest fringing barrier reef. the name “Bahamas” comes from the Spanish words “baja mar”, meaning shallow water or sea. there are many kinds of events like a Junkanoo, McLean's Town Conch Cracking Festival.

                "I recently received my token for being two years of being clean and sober at my local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, as well as my Narcotics Anonymous meeting. It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. \"For where your treasure is there your heart will be also\". My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction. To be able to stand up in front of a room filled with my peers and honestly say that I have been clean and sober for two years was such a memorable and special experience and event."

                "I haven’t been able to write in this journal for a little while, life has been pretty crazy lately but I feel like I am taking the steps to improve my life. About two months ago, I had a hard day at work, my boss gave me a second warning about being late and warned me that next time I would be fired. On my way home from work that day, I stopped off at the liquor store and bought a jug of vodka. When I got to my car, I immediately started drinking, I felt so hopeless and like I had nothing to live for. I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills. I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn’t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn’t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn’t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn’t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on. All of my personal belongings were taken into the units custody. Soon a psychologist came into give me an evaluation. After I was at this place for seven hours with staff members monitoring me, I was told I could leave if there was someone who would come and get me. I called my mom and she came and picked me up, was so scared she was going to be mad at me, but when she arrived she gave me a huge hug as tears were streaming down her cheeks, she told me she was going to help me with my drinking problem and she loved me."

We found a nice dance club, which people had good things to say about. We went dancing and had a few drinks. We stayed up pretty late and ended up getting a hotel in downtown Chicago. The entire experience was really fun and I would love to do it again. We are already planning our next trip to Chicago, maybe to go to a museum or head to another baseball game.

Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm. We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin. She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around. But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard. It was just so sad, all of it. Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain. After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade. Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point. All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly. We then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks. It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason. I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home. I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt. I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again. But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way."

We got a slow start today, as usual. After we finally made it out of the house, we all got into the families minivan. We then began our trip to the zoo. We finally arrived. It was a hot sunny day. It was a perfect day for the zoo. We got to see all cool types of animals. I think my favorite was the monkeys. One of them had a back injury for some reason, so it was secluded from the others while it healed. The penguins were pretty neat too. After we had finished seeing everything the zoo had to offer, we got back into the minivan and departed for the restaurant we were going to. I think everyone was exhausted by time we got to the restaurant from walking around the zoo all day in the hot sun. I didn't really like the place we went to eat, because the music was just a little to loud. The food was pretty decent at least. We paid the bill and headed home to sing happy birthday to my sister and eat cake. This was probably my favorite part, because I could finally sit down and relax."

Luckily, we did not encounter any delays and we arrived in plenty of time. I had booked a transfer from the airport to the Pier, and the bus driver gave us a tour on the way. We passed the Space Needle which was awesome! Once at the Pier, we had to wait a bit to board. When we got on board, we went directly to wait in line to eat. It had been hours since we had any real food and we were not able to go to our rooms yet. We walked around a bit and then finally went to our cabin.  Our vacation was finally starting! The days were filled with food, scenery, movies, casinos, shows and some land excursions. Exploring different parts of the ship kept us very busy.  The most memorable part of the cruise was when we went into Glacier Bay - the scenery was breathtaking! We saw the glacier break apart into the water a few times, once was a large break. I took so many pictures but I couldn't fully capture the beauty and awe of the all of the moments. This trip was a once in a lifetime experience...even if I go back, I could never fully experience the magic of the first time - but it would be fun to try!"

It was also my son and daughter's first time riding the coaster at Goats on the Roof. My daughter wasn't tall enough to ride by herself, so I had to ride with her this time. I cannot wait until she is able to do it all on her own, because my son loved it! It was one of his favorite things. My kids also loved our cabin. We had a huge cabin with enough room for my entire family to stay together. The kids loved that it had an indoor pool, hottub, game room, and a theater room! They still talk about their favorite rides at DollyWood. This was my daughter's first time riding a lot of bigger rides, so it took us a little while to talk her onto the roller coasters, but once she tried it she was hooked. Her favorite was the Fire Chaser and she has been begging to get to ride it again. My children enjoyed this trip and cannot wait to go back. We are actually considering going back next month and letting them see all of the lights at Dollywood."

I was freaking out pretty hard when it dawned on me that hey, I was marrying the girl of my dreams. The way we had met was spectacular, and totally happenstance. We had both been at a Spiritual guidance gathering at a retreat in the woods, and from the moment I saw her I knew that I needed to talk to her. I approached her with a soft smile on my face and we caught eyes, and I could immediately tell that she was the one. Now here we are, two and half years later, and I'm struggling with my damn tie and sweating and just overall a nervous wreck. Like I said, I realized that this is the girl of my dream, and the way we met was just serendipitous. I waited at the altar with a lump in my throat, waiting for her beautiful face to be led down the aisle by her Father. When that moment arrived, I was starstruck, I damn near fell over due to how beautiful she actually was, I hadn't actually seen her in about three days, due to the bachelorette party, and of course the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride before this moment on their wedding day. As soon as she reached the altar, I felt all the panick in my heart dissolve. We smiled at eachother and took one anothers hands as we looked towards the priest to begin the ceremony. I couldn't wait to make her mine, to bring her into my life as my wife, and I knew she felt the same way. It was absolutely lovely, and everything I could have expected and more. The reception was a blast as well, plenty of people laughing and telling happy stories of the two of us, and wishing us an absolutely blissful life together. That being said, I think we can leave the honeymoon out of this, because that might get a little racy, even for you diary. When we arrived home from the honeymoon, and I had to return to work, it was with great disdain that I left my new bride home alone, though I knew I would be back to see her in only eight short hours. I made haste to the office to begin my day and effectively my new life. When I walked into the office, I was immediately called into my supervisors office and I thought trouble immediately, only to be relieved that there was no trouble at all. In fact, it had been a promotion waiting for me for all of my diligent work and loyalty to the company. Could this get any better? I mean, I have had some pretty damn good luck all things considered, but is it really luck? Or is it this result of my hard work, patience and determination in succeeding in this life? I choose to believe that it's probably a mixture of both. I am more than pleased with the way my life is turning out so far!"

                "He's the love of my life and a great man, but the drugs are the greatest source of pain in my life. I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day. I love him with all my heart but I can't stay with him if he relapses again, because next time I don't know what he will do."

We enjoyed our time there and swimming there was a blast. Afterwards we went to the night entertainment. It was there that we saw the different shows for kids and grown ups. I was able to get more drinks from that bar and bring it to her and the family. The next day we had alot of fun doing all the other activities."

Even before we left, they were trading email addresses, phone numbers, and friending each other on facebook. It was all surreal. I wouldn't change a thing. On our way home back to reality Sunday evening, my husband commented on how much he enjoyed meeting everyone's families. He taught the kids how to fish and bait hooks with worms. I was so happy we did this. I couldn't imagine a better setting for my 40th birthday. It is something I hope we do every year."

I’ve been singer her this song since she was a baby, this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a \"big kid\" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head. . I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon and fruit. Every once in a while I will let her eat her favorite cereal but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I recon she was nervous. So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time and I walked her inside. The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT ITS THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!! Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!"

I overpay a flight ticket, i layover for about 12 hours ins another country, i got event sick because of the meal, but you know what?, i don't regret at all. At the end of the day i saw her face, i saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, which is such my little baby as well , and i will remember that for the rest of my life. I said to her that when i was in the airplane, i saw her mother in the sky, she told me to carry her, and said i love you in behave of her. My niece was so happy, she hug me and i whisper: your mother is so proud of you honey. I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in the heaven. The night was too short, but the memories are infinites, because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love.

I showed up assuming I wouldn't get chosen for the team anyway, seeing as how I have on real athletic abilities, but to my surprise, everyone else on the team was just as bad as I was! I made the team and found that I really connected with all the other players. We all seemed to have similar pasts. We were all used to being losers. None of us expected to make the team, and we all had no illusions of winning anything. It was just for fun. Having met such a like minded group was unusual and exciting for all of us. Before we knew it, we were meeting up to practice as much as we could, just because we enjoyed the company of one another. We became a family. We understood each other. When we played we almost became one person. It was quite amazing. We played team after team, just enjoying the experience, and when we would win time and time again, we would kind of just laugh it off as a fluke, or we would assume the other team had no experience. But, before we knew it, we were in the final game, playing for the title. We all expected that this would surely be where our luck ran out, but it was not. We won. A group of failures all came together and won a championship together. That summer was one to remember. Sometimes all it takes to win, is having some fun."

I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children that were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it, and wish for more events like that in the future."

The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town. We spent hours there just talking and people watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all. Besides that day, we had a couple great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it. Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life.

The afternoon that she gave me the money, I went home and put it in my desk drawer, with intentions of depositing it in my bank the following day so that I could make the purchase. Later that evening, I had a friend come over who was having some problems with her boyfriend. We talked to each other and caught up and she asked if she could use my computer, which I of course said yes. I was on the phone with my husband who was out of town and in a different room while she was on the computer. Shortly thereafter, she suddenly had to leave and her reason behind it was unclear and sounded suspicious, but knowing her I summed it up to she was lying about what she was really going to do and I didn't really care too much. The next day I was getting ready to leave to go to the bank and I opened up my desk drawer and the money was gone! I checked my wallet and purse to see if for some reason I had put it in there, although I know for a fact that I never moved it. I immediately knew that she had stolen the money from me, and her wishy-washy excuse for leaving now made perfect sense. I was furious. I called her immediately and she did not answer. I called her 3 more times and she still did not answer. So I sent her a text message and pretended like everything was ok so that she would call me back. She called me back and I asked her if she took the money. She claimed to not know what I was talking about and tried to blame it on my kids (who were all asleep when she was there) and I could sense that she was lying yet again. There was not much that I could do at this point but to write her off as a friend and know that she could not be trusted. This was extra hurtful to me because I now had to come up with $800 of my own money to pay for the tickets since I was the person trusted to do this. I struggle financially as it is, so $800 is a lot of money to me."

However, my bosses felt that it was time to give me more responsibility and more money for the work that I have done for them so far. More importantly, because I am still young, it shows that I am gaining a growing reputation in my field. I work in a relatively large area in terms of population, but my field isn't very big. Most people who work in the field know one another and word spreads quickly. In the time I've with my current employer, I've already met many of my counterparts at other organizations. I've also met many of the owners and supervisors of other organizations in the field. Getting a promotion and more recognition so quickly will allow me to have more options if I decide to leave my job. Additionally, it made me feel good that I was able to impress my bosses. Many young employees don't get the opportunity that I've gotten so far so it was important that I made a good impression. I've found that people appreciate my work ethic and my hard work, which are two things that are important to me. I've come along way since college and it wasn't the easiest road, so to be working in and excelling in my field is an important sign of who I am as a professional. I intend to take this on and continue making my bosses pleased with the decision to hire me in the coming months. I also intend to see if it has impressed people outside of my organization for other potential opportunities."

Can't wait to have people over. Love the fireplace too. It is very relaxing in the winter."

I lost everything I cared about, was mentally and physically abused, heart-broken, homeless, hungry and lost. This continued on for years with little to no change or progress, no matter what I did or how hard I tried. Feeling the most lonely, sad. tired and hopeless I have ever felt in life, I started to give up. About a month ago, however, I was shown just how fast life can turn around. I woke up one day that was looking to be just as empty and hopeless as every other day, oh how life is full of surprises! I was randomly blessed with a home after being homeless for years. Someone payed to first few months bills for me, got me moved in and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. My kids will be back home with me soon and I am starting to find myself again! Never give up! It's never too late! And do not ever forget that life can change in a blink of an eye. Keep pushing!"

It was emotional when we had to receive our award because he gave a short speech about his father. Then we headed over to the local pub and had a few beers to wind down.

On the third day, we went to various places and buildings that we had marked from the previous day. The designs of various hotels are just amazing. Most of them have high-end shops. One arts shop we went in had artworks priced at least $10,000. The other interesting experience was to witness casinos in all the hotels we visited. We played lightly in some of them and in fact, won a little money. Also, other memorable encounters were the dancing water waves that synchronized with music at Bellagio and the volcanic eruptions at Mirage."

Big announcements were made to all of my friends and family about this new undertaking, the new sober me. Day 2 - 5, this is easy being sober and slightly more functional. Motivation to work out kicked in around Day 6, which lasted until about Day 9. Day 10 - 15, I yearned for this new and improved sleep I was promised so early on in my quest for sobriety and it finally came. The deepest soundest sleep I have had in years, it felt amazing to wake up so tired because you slept so hard - I got this! Day 16 - 20, still sleeping and I guess I am a better functioning human. Still hate my job and only slightly more motivation to work out. Day 21, an invite to join friends at a bar - gulp! Could the new sober day me complete this test successfully? Yes, I did it! I went to a bar and woke up the next day feeling great - no hangover to plague me. Day 22 - 26, sleep is great, sleep is good but what about the higher functioning me? Have all of the years of almost daily drinking dulled my ability to be a higher functioning successful person? I only have 4 more days to figure this out, maybe it all clicks on day 30? The final 4 days were spent recapping this journey until it arrived, the big 3-0. I woke up that morning feeling nothing new or different, I am still the same me."

My goal has always been for her to be excellent and I know she will be. At the beginning it was very difficult for him to keep his concentration for a couple of hours, since shortly after starting something he got bored or fixed his attention on something else.

It was at that moment when I decided to go to a specialist, and with her we did everything necessary to improve her attention.

I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time. He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us. The car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed. My wife drove his bike down a week later. The entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp. He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down. Wish we had just waited 2 more weeks to move him in."

Another person I met was Byron. He was Jewish and recently converted. Apparently he's also a famous DJ and has the same music taste as me. I'm planning on going to one of his shows next week! I'm not really a fan of clubs but hopefully it will be a fun time. Anyways, brunch was pretty good. We went to a Greek restaurant that I've never been to and had the best gyros.

Making the same thing for dinner two days in a row having forgotten she made that meal yesterday and then the sadness in her face when she is shown the leftovers from the previous day. I think Mom was realizing it and trying so hard to fight the symptoms. We went to the doctor who referred us to a specialist. The specialist prescribed medication and occupational therapy. While her symptoms are mild for the moment, she fixates on losing her quality of life. She worries about becoming a burden to us and also of being alone. For me, I spend my time reassuring her while also researching the details of the disease. My kids do not know yet, and I stress about when and what to tell them. My brother has found support groups that can help navigate the progression of the illness. For the time being, Mom is still living with Dad, and he is also scared. He is scared that he won't be able to help her in the ways she needs help."

                "I have five children in age from 23 down to 16. The 16 year olds are twins (just for the record). In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter. She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her. She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree. My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it. Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc. She also couldn't start the \"early college\" program until she was a junior (11th grade). She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years. We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation. The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.  I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job. We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the \"home\" phone. The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate. My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better. I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving. She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left. I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is. I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation. She's 18 and can make her own choices, but we wished she had not made this choice."

                "My youngest child's birthday party was somewhat hard to plan. My husband was working second shift again at that time and so her party had to be on a weekend so that he should have the day off, but even that was not a promise. The weather was still cold enough at times that we knew it had to be an indoor party or we might get rained out. We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building. No reason to run back into town when nature was providing its own cooler for us. My sister and one of her friends also showed up early to help decorate. A decent amount of people showed up but we all had a good time. My mom got her sugar glider out to show people and it ended up jumping on everyone's heads. It even jumped on my oldest and she freaked out and ran into a table. After making sure she was alright we found it kind of funny since sugar gliders are not dangerous animals at all. My youngest spent most of her time crawling around the building and being passed from one person to another but right after presents were opened and people were getting ready to leave she decided to surprise everyone and took a couple of steps. It wasn't much, but it was a start. I was also impressed that my mother-in-law showed up for the party because we had invited other family members that she dose not get along with as well and she usually tires to avoid them. Thankfully there were no problems and everyone had a great time."

So that it what I did as well and it also happened that the rain clouds decided to go away as well too. we did not have any rain for like 3 months where I lived because I figured out how to do a reverse rain dance! prior to this we were getting too much rain and the farmers were not able to plant their crops so everyone was going to starve. I am happy to say that will not be the case now! However, there was one drawback. Which wound up being the fact that because there was no rain the air pressure built up. So the atmosphere wound up producing a land hurricane. It destroyed a large area and was very dangerous. All is well that ends well. I was happy that the crops were left unharmed.

We laughed with each other the whole time. It was like old times. It was so good to feel that feeling again that we once shared together. It made we wonder why we both never tried making our relationship last. Throughout the day we grew closer to one another. She began to open up to me and we decided that we try and make it work out again. Now that we both know we want each other in our lives we made a promise that we would both give it our all. We decided to have some lunch, so I took her to the side of the park that had a nice view, laid a blanket down, and told her I would be right back with our food. I went to get our food and stopped by a booth that was selling flowers. I thought she would like it if I surprised her with them. I was walking back to where she was and surprised her with the flowers. She loved them. We sat and enjoyed our lunch together before leaving the theme park. We continued our relationship, and everything was going great."

I saw a couple of guys in jerseys crying with excitement and pride and hugging each other- I didn't realize how much this meant to some people! My dad gave me a great big high-five and then started doing the same. to his friends. Then, I mimicked and held my hand up for \"some skin\" to anyone in arm's length. I got slaps. and hugs from everyone around during those first ten minutes when everyone's adrenaline was through the roof! Even the sports casters on the television seemed blown away at the victory.

He was so thrilled, we were all thrilled, my older son said it was worth all the waiting around. Then we waited for the medal ceremony which was a bit of a saga due to miscommunication, someone had told the rink we had left so they tried to do the ceremony without \"B\". Anyway, \"B\" won and it was a very special time. We then packed up and drove the 2 hours home. I felt so relieved and could breathe again, all his hard work was paying off."

Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months. I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together. If it's meant to be then it will all work out."
