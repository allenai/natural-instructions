    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the numbers 0 (entailment), 1 (neutral), or 2(contradiction)."

            "explanation": "One sentence says, \"Dancing on the stage\" while the other sentence says, \"Dance performance on the dais\", which is clearly giving the same meaning and are related to each other. So the classification is entailment."
