    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the letters 0 (entailment), 1 (neutral), or 2(contradiction).",

            "input": "sentence_A: A dancer is dancing on the stage. sentence_B: A girl is giving dance performance on the dais.",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "One sentence says, \"Dancing on the stage\" while the other sentence says, \"Dance performance on the dais\", which is clearly giving the same meaning and are related to each other. So the classification is entailment."

            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "The first one says, \"The crowd is cheering at dance performance\" whereas the second one says, \"Enjoying eating the food.\" There is no relation at all between the two sentences as it is neither supporting nor contradicting. So it is neutral."

            "explanation": "Here the first sentence says, \"A man is standing\", while the second sentence contradicts saying there is no man standing so clearly this is a contradiction so label 2."
