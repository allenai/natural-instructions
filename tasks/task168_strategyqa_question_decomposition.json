        "Question Decomposition"
    ],
    "Definition": "In the following task, you are given a yes/no question, its answer, and additional information which includes a description of key term in the question and several facts. Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates to the correct answer.\n\nEmphasis & Caution: 1. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers from preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks, 2. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question, 3. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition. ",
