    "Definition": "In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into matching, summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense groups. Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".",

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man?

M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices.

M: Well, I got this ringing in my ears. It's so terrible that I can hardly hear people talking now. W: Are you in any pain or is there any fluid? M: No discharge, just a slight earache. W: Does the pain happen all the time, or once in a while. M: It has been aching for two days and it's never stopped. I thought it might be due to my flying in the air, and after some rest it'll be all gone. But who knows it's getting worse. I need to see the doctor. W: The doctor will be busy at the hospital until this evening. The earliest you could see him would be tomorrow morning at ten. M: The time is good for me. I'll come in then if that's okay. W: That will be fine; in the meantime you should try to take it easy. Don't press your ear and don't have water in when you take a shower.

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting.

W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated.

W: Then when did his movie career really start? M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society. W: So how many more movies did he make? M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?

W: Oh, there is. It can be very crowded because it's a popular store, and you get a lot of people. It often results in very long lines at the checkouts. You can wait for quite a long time to pay for your goods. M: So... are you planning another trip to the store? W: Yes, I expect so.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose. Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit. W: Of course. Goodbye Mr. Holloway., Question: Where did Mr. Holloway buy the clothing?

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What does the man think we should do now? (A) Minimize the use of fossil fuels. (B) Start developing alternative fuels. (C) Find the real cause for global warming.",

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay. Caller: And what's your name? Apartment Owner: It's Norman. Norman Bates. Caller: Alright, Mr. Bates. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Apartment Owner: Bye., Question: How would you describe the location of the apartment? (A) The woman can catch a bus to school in front of her apartment. (B) A supermarket and shopping center are only a few blocks away. (C) The apartment is in a relatively quiet neighborhood.",

I'm playing a consultancy role, really. I've only been here in China a month, but I'm already on very good terms with my colleagues in the Department of Computer Science. Well, I'm happy that you could come. Do sit down, please. W: Dr. Francis, do you know I've got a chance to go to Cambridge in August? I wonder if you could tell me something about Britain. M: Certainly. Well, I was actually brought up in Scotland. Enn, in fact, I've never been to Cambridge. But well,.., yes, I'm sure I can give you some useful tips. Now, what do you want to know, Li Ming? W: Things like weather. What's the usual temperature there? M: Mmm, the temperature in Scotland is 22, or 23 degrees Centigrade, on average, I think. But Cambridge would be warmer, around 25, I would guess, because it's down south. W: Oh, that's nice. Do you know it is 34 here? Last year it reached 39. By the way, where do you think I should stay? M: Oh, that's important. You can, err,.., I suppose, stay in the college-owned flats, which are often near where you have your classes, and some are even on the campus. That would certainly be convenient. W: Yes, it would. M: But it can also be a disadvantage because you are, in a sense, separated from ordinary society. You're a language teacher, and I think learning from society is a valuable experience. W: Yes, yes, exactly, so what's the alternative? M: Maybe finding an English host family.

Stacy: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it.

I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it. Stacy: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week.

Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ... Brandon: I just don't know.

Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"?

Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"?

They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. M: That's a pretty long span of time. W: I know. That's what she said, though.

W: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size. M: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? W: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine? M: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another. M: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized. W: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized? M: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that. W: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared? M: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going. W: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes.

M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?

W: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. M: That's a pretty long span of time. W: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\" M: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell? W: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size. M: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? W: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine? M: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.

I actually work in London for the Green Peace organization. We've been going for a few decades and we're a non-violent, non-political organization. We're involved in anti-nuclear activity, conservation and protection of animals and protection and support of our eco-system. I'm the action organizer and arrange any protests. W: Right! A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize? M: Well, recently we've been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with. W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"? M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible. M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there's no doubt you're doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck.

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another. M: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized. W: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized? M: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that. W: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared? M: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year.
