        "You need to read the given passage and construct a question about the information present in the passage. The question should be answerable from the passage. Most importantly, only those questions are allowed whose answers cannot be determined from a single sentence. Do not generate questions that require only a single sentence to answer. Instead, try to combine two sentences and create a question from that combination. Do not create open-ended questions, i.e., the answers to them cannot be found precisely from the information provided in the passage."

Peter King, the New York Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, have argued for increased surveillance of Muslims in the United States.\nSent 3: Local police departments \"have to realize that the threat is coming from the Muslim community and increase surveillance there,\" he says.\nSent 4: Others have asked whether leads were properly followed and if better sharing of information between agencies would have helped thwart the bombing.\nSent 5: However, the government, with its $40 billion annual intelligence budget, already amasses vast quantities of information on the private lives of Muslims in the United States.\nSent 6: The FBI has 3,000 intelligence analysts working on counterterrorism and 15,000 paid informants, according to Mother Jones.\nSent 7: Exactly how many of them are focused on Muslims in the United States is unknown; there is little transparency in this area.\nSent 8: But, given the emphasis the FBI has placed on preventing Muslim terrorism, and based on my interviews with FBI agents working on counterterrorism, there could be as many as two-thirds assigned to spying on Muslims.\nSent 9: Taking the usual estimate of the Muslim population in the United States of 2.35 million, this would mean the FBI has a spy for every 200 Muslims in the United States.\nSent 10: When one adds the resources of the National Security Agency, regional intelligence fusion centers, and the counterterrorism work of local police departments, such as the New York Police Department (where a thousand officers are said to work on counterterrorism and intelligence), the number of spies per Muslim may increase dramatically.\nSent 11: East Germany's communist-era secret police, the Stasi, had one intelligence analyst or informant for every 66 citizens.\nSent 12: This suggests that Muslims in the United States could be approaching levels of state surveillance similar to that which the East German population faced from the Stasi.\nSent 13: Yet, as the Stasi itself eventually discovered, no system of surveillance can ever produce total knowledge of a population.\nSent 14: Indeed, the greater the amount of information collected, the harder it is to interpret its meaning.\nSent 15: In the majority of terrorist attacks in recent years, the relevant information was somewhere in the government's systems, but its significance was lost amid a morass of useless data.\nSent 16: What is obscured by the demands for ever greater surveillance and information processing is that security is best established through relationships of trust and inclusion within the community.\nSent 17: The real missed opportunity to intervene before the bombs went off in Boston likely came three months earlier, when bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev stood up during a Friday prayer service at his mosque - the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge - to angrily protest the imam's sermon.\nSent 18: The imam had been celebrating the life of the Rev.

Kilbride will deliver the keynote speech to the legal aid providers on Monday and will discuss the high court's plan to hike attorney registration fees by $42 to cover the shortfall in the interest income.\nSent 9: The high court floated a plan during the spring legislative session to raise those fees, which would bring in roughly $2.4 million and raise the base fee for active attorneys from $180 to $222.\nSent 10: That proposal languished, but many observers noted that the high court could raise the fees without legislative approval.\nSent 11: Organizers of the conference acknowledged that much of the discussion at the event will center on how to use resources most effectively on a shoestring budget.\nSent 12: In fact, all of the hotel rooms and conference facilities were donated to the group after another organization announced at the end of June that it was calling off its convention, leaving the facilities open, said Linda Zazove, deputy director of Land of Lincoln and a member of the conference's planning committee.\nSent 13: A core group of legal aid attorneys hatched the idea of a conference after visiting with representatives of similar programs in other states who regularly hold such meetings, she said.\nSent 14: Originally, the organizers hoped for a fall convention but they sprang at the opportunity when the rooms opened up.\nSent 15: \"This is a unique opportunity for people who are in the trenches delivering services to get together, meet each other and share ideas,\" Zazove said.\nSent 16: The providers will attend sessions on car-related consumer law, bankruptcy, immigration, welfare, assisting pro se clients, recruiting private attorneys and Internet resources for both advocates and clients.\nSent 17: Ruth Ann Schmitt, executive director of the Lawyers Trust Fund, which is covering some of the costs of the gathering, acknowledged that the legal aid community faces many problems but said the meeting could give attorneys a morale boost.\nSent 18: \"It's not often that the rank and file get together to talk about their problems....

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.\nSent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.\nSent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.\nSent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.\nSent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.\nSent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.\nSent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.\nSent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.\nSent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.\nSent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.",
