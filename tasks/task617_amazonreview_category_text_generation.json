One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track.

For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing.

Anyway, with none of the dogs wanting to eat it, I have no choice but to return. And since it's the 20lb box, inside of ANOTHER box... What a pain. lol",

Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now.

Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be.",

Be sure to remove that first before you give it to your dog or run the risk that your dog cracks a tooth and undergoes a painful (and pricy) surgery to have that corrected. When I took out the washer I double and eventually triple knotted the knot at the bottom to keep it in the ball.

So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I’ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn’t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that’s the only upside for me.

Basically fading techniques to gradually take away your babies sources of comfort until they comply. The second part is for those naughty babies who actually need more help getting to sleep. For that she recommends the extinction method, softened up by a new name and some witty jokes. The author seems like a very selfish person. She recommends sleep training at 2 months old. Most pediatricians wouldn’t recommend that. Im really happy I listened to my gut and stopped reading",

It baffles me - why would I want a more pricy griddle with separate units that you can’t cook both eggs and bacon? Just know that anything with a liquid consistency CANNOT be cooked on this griddle. 2nd ISSUE- After the 2nd use, I realized that the temperature of the two plates did not operate correctly. When I turned down the upper unit (to keep pancakes warm) the lower unit stopped cooking and would not readjust back to set temperature until the upper unit was increased to the same temperature. 3RD & 4TH ISSUES - Also upon 2nd use, two other things surfaced. I realized that the upper unit doesn’t lie down completely flat on the counter surface so it remains sloped even when in the unlocked position. I readjusted to allow the end of the unit to be slightly off the counter. Which is when I realized that the I could no longer see the dials. Over all I do not recommend this unit for those reasons. Just buy the Presto product for half the money, have more cooking space, and an easy to use product. Use the left over money to buy a panini press or a apply it towards an indoor grill.",

It was great after the first wash but the second & third just went downhill. I only wish each section of this comforter has a seal to keep all the fillings from separating. All the fillings are pretty much gone & this comforter went flat. The extra fillings left would move to the corner specifically to the feet corners which then drags the blanket off to each corner or off the bed. It’s very annoying that I have to shake the fillings to spread out evenly every night. I love how big the blanket is but this problem with the fillings piling up at the end of each corner & how flAt it has gone are a huge problem. I will be tossing this one out. It served well but unfortunately only a year. Before wash: It came inside a zipper bag. It was the perfect size. No damages. No stains. Not used. After wash: It took quite a while to dry since it was a very big blanket. High on dry and blanket came out great. No damages. No threads. No burn. I bought this oversize King for my queen duet cover. I read that to get it big & fluffy its best to buy a bigger insert for the duet. It was perfect. Big and fluffy. Made my bed looks extra soft and comfy. I'm always cold & will need about 2-3 blankets to keep me warm but this blanket was very warm. It kept me warm throughout the whole night. Maybe a little too warm that I kicked the blanket off the bed LMAO!! I think it is more on the heavy side & warmer. But it was perfect to cuddle & wrap my legs on top. My husband loves it as well.

I thought this to be true as I had purchases them before from a retail store and was looking for an exact replacement. I hate how polyester socks feel on my feet. When I got the product, it is now a primarily polyester fabric with a lesser amount of cotton(in the 30% area if I remember right)making them polyester socks not cotton. I dont know why Hanes and Fruit of the Loom have stopped making cotton tube socks but it is really irritating. I am having no luck finding a suitable, quality replacement.

Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake. I strongly caution you against buying anything from this company.",

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame.",

Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There’s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back.

Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous.

The straps (as many have mentioned) are attached in a very flimsy manner, and in fact are attached such that they can’t help but separate. A linear pull on the straps or mat delaminates them because they are stitched backwards to the direction of force. An obvious design flaw. Furthermore, the mat lacks any heft at all to hold it down on the angled surface of the vehicle...it’s so light the force of gravity does not even overcome the memory curve you get if you keep it rolled up. Funny though - if you look at the product picture you can see the upward curve of the mat lol. Save yourself some money and go to Kmart, buy TWO bath mats with rubber backings and drape one over your vehicle, and place the other under the back end of your kayak to prevent scrapes as you angle it up onto your racks. You will pay 1/2 of the 40 bucks you would be shelling out for this mat and can use them to throw all of your wet gear on in the back of your vehicle when you’re done.

Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an \"old formula\" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the \"old\" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was \"Washington Blvd Sales\".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the \"old formula\" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume.

I called Samsung and was told there was an error on my paperwork that put the date of manufacture versus date of purchase. Samsung warranty is a refurbished product 90 days after purchase. I was told to send back the refurbished one so they could send a new SSD. The process took a couple of weeks. I received my new SSD and in May it too failed. I again called Samsung and went through the process. The drive was defective and I was sent a refurbished SSD again. I called Samasung, again. I was told this time it was over 90 days since purchase and a refurbished exchange is their warranty. So I basically only had each new SSD for less than 2 months before they failed.

Miele site and support tell you to bring it I’m for servicing at one of their stores. However thanks to the internet if you clear the jam and wait a few hours it works. The thing maneuvers terribly, it won’t move then smashes into everything when it does so if you have no furniture or painted base boards it’s probably fine. I just carry it. The carpet attachment meant for furniture and stairs isn’t powered so only use if you have a fresh bag since it works on suction. It is also not sealed so it jams with fur and you have to either buy a new one or disassemble and clean. Now the wand extension and retraction mechanism broke so I have to buy a new one or vacuum the house hunched over as it only stays at its smallest setting which is like 2 feet. We bought this on the recommendation of family and they felt so bad after they used it they offered to give us the money for it. The floor attachment has horrible suction and design, it pushes anything it finds rather than suck it up. You have to keep lifting it and placing it on top of where you want to vacuum to get it to suck up anything. I wouldn’t recommend this model to anyone.",

However, we are now promptly returning it and will buy from a different brand. First, the crevice tool was never included in the box. If the vacuum actually worked as described, this would not have been a huge issue. As you can probably already infer, the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment. After using it twice (both times fully charged), we realized that our old, much cheaper handheld still worked better. With the brush or extension tube attachment connected, it seemed essentially worthless with regard to suction. Further, even without an attachment, the vacuum literally had no true suction power. It struggled to pick up even the smallest and lightest weight particles on the floor, stairs, counter, etc. Again, given the positive reviews, we were very hopeful that it would be a great replacement. Unfortunately, it's boxed up and will be dropped off at UPS tomorrow.",

So far I have made two pot roasts and brown rice both times. My first pot roast I slow cooked for 4 hours from frozen and it came out great. Second time tried a roast with veggies and cooked it for 8 hours and that worked great too. Please read the cheat sheet that comes in the box. If you read the cheat sheet, you don't cook Brown Rice using the \"Rice\" setting, You have to cook it on \"Pressure Cook\" for 20 minutes with the pressure valve closed and do a quick release. Then the brown rice comes out perfect. The cooker has a stainless steel pot that is super easy to clean. I just wipe, rinse or throw in the dishwasher. I love being able to cook using just one pot.

It came off again by the next day. I installed another new tail scrubber and it only lasted about to weeks before coming off. I had a new actual Polaris tail scrubber that was still in the package. Upon comparing the product the actual Polaris is a denser foam and has a smaller hole in the center so it fits tighter. I installed the actual Polaris and is been on a month now with no problem.

I bought this as a first crossbow gift to my sister and purchased everything, the crossbow target block, extra lube wax, extra arrows and the Barnett crossbow case that came recommended to fit this model (which it did not and I am also returning, but this is a different issue all together). I contacted the seller and I got an email back saying their customer service is closed until Sunday because of Jewish Shabbat. So what am I supposed to give her as a gift now? The extra items I purchased to go with her crossbow, without the actual crossbow?! 'Happy birthday sister, I got you a crossbow, but it was missing items and I had to send it back, so here is the accessories to it.' Yeah, that's going to go over well. I don't often write bad reviews, but had I not checked it thoroughly and put it together myself (or at least tried to), I would have given her an item that could have seriously injured her because it was not bolted down properly from lack of missing items.

After over a month of trying to get Amazon and/or the company to respond, the company finally responded and send a replacement pump. This one crapped out in 36 hours. Amazon is so big now that they don't know when they're selling knock offs and lemons. The ratio of good products to lemons is shifting in favor of lemons. Old review: This is a great product when it works, BUT: We purchased this item a little over one month ago. We set it up and began using it about three days after it arrived. Within the month of purchasing it, it has broken in different ways six times. The first 5, my husband was able to repair it himself. However, the sixth time, the necessary repairs are beyond the scope of our ability. So I checked on Amazon how we could exchange it for a model that WORKS. Sadly, we missed the window for which Amazon is willing to replace the defective product by about 10 days. This is extremely frustrating -- almost as if it's built only to last during the warranty period, after which it irreparably breaks and there is no possibility of exchanging it for a model that works. We invested plenty of our own time and energy repairing it ourselves, so we believe we have been plenty generous in terms of holding up our end of the bargain. Now it is entirely useless and we can't return or exchange it. To put it another way: THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE BUYER PAYS FOR A LEMON, AND IN RETURN, AMAZON SAYS \"TOO BAD, NOT OUR PROBLEM\" WHEN THE PRODUCT FAILS. THE BUYER IS OUT $$$ BUT AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME AMAZON HAS RIPPED US OFF (THE OTHER WAS A PAIR OF WIRELESS EARBUDS PURCHASED DURING THE AMAZON PRIME DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST THAT NEVER WORKED AT ALL -- AND NOT JUST US -- BUT SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE REVIEW SECTION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WARN OTHER BUYERS OF THE SCAM) We have been good customers of Amazon from the beginning. However, the customer service is getting worse and worse every day. Now that Amazon and Bezos have more money than several small countries, not to mention the VAST number of consumers who have placed our trust in Amazon, purchased probably THOUSANDS of their products, and contributed greatly to the company's wealth (which, according to their hardworking employees, does NOT trickle down by investing in the employees who actually do the hard work). Compare this to a friend of mine who bought a Fitbit many months ago and decided she didn't like the design and Amazon didn't make her jump through hoops or pay shipping/return charges, they simply sent her a brand new one in a style she liked. That Fitbit cost about 5x more than the two products I've tried to return, but our customer service experiences are vastly different. Part of Amazon's game is to make returning a defective product such a hassle that the customer ultimately gives up and buys a new product, eating the financial loss. AMAZON. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. ANY. MORE. So what am I paying the \"Prime\" membership for? Being a Prime customer is getting more expensive, yet the \"services\" covered under #Prime are eroding to the point that there's virtually no benefit to being a Prime customer. Yes, I've talked more about Amazon's business practices than the lemon product I should be reviewing here. But how can I review a product that has spent more time not working than working? And if Amazon doesn't have my back when I'm spending tons of money on this site? Who has MY back? Amazon, I'd love a response.",

So, he tracks them down and listens at the door of a sleazy hotel and he hears low voices and a hissing or buzzing sound... the next leap of logic is they must be building bombs. If they are building bombs... they must have guns. Seriously?? Then, the main character decides they are OBVIOUSLY trying to kill him... but only after carrying out their terrorist strike in Portland. Why would terrorists wait to kill the main character until AFTER their terrorist strike? Personally, I would kill off the main character beforehand just because... and this is my conclusion... he is TSTL.

I was well aware that I would be plunking down over $30 (+tax) for little tubes of plastic worth two bucks but decided to do this because this company claimed to be the first, best, authentic and could have had some advantage over other brands. My critique: (1) The pack has two large cups and two small ones. I would have preferred just two for half the price or, for $30, an assortment of four sizes. I only would use one at a time of the same size. (2) For a normal or small face with structure instead of fat, the large one does not work. It loses suction unless it goes over a broad area, preferably with fat, like the cheeks. For most of the face, going over features and contours, it lost contact and lost suction. The small one was okay for small areas and under the eyes, but obviously too small and therefore too strong for the large areas of the face. The woman in the demos on their website has a very broad and fat face, very plump lips, so the large cup suited her. (3) I felt ripped off at the high price. For what it is, even if it worked for me, the price is gouging. I went to the website for the \"free\" booklet and it turns out to not be a download. They require me to give them my personal information so that they can email the booklet to me. I wonder what advertisers they would sell my information to. No thanks. The concept is great, though not original. It is similar to the folk remedy of cupping that uses material soaked in alcohol is set on fire to create a vacuum inside an upturned glass and then the glass is placed on the skin. The idea of converting this into a smaller unit that could be used on the face is brilliant, but the size is not right for everyone, maybe not even for most. I absolutely love Amazon for helping us shop with confidence, share experiences and opinions and help us find what we consider to be suitable. They made it easy to return and shop for a replacement brand.",

I thought I had gotten a bad batch or it was a mistake. There were white chunks that didn't dissolve and made it disgusting to drink. Customer service said this was not a mistake, this was their new formula, and recommended putting the powder in a food processor to break up the chunks. Not wanting to waste my money, I put some in my Magic Bullet blender since I don't own a food processor to try to break down those rock-hard chunks so I could at least use what I'd bought. It didn't make one bit of difference. This company has ruined what was used to be a great product and lost my business.",

Kept solely in the house away from any other products, so there was no reason for it to get bent. The case is a super tight fit around the iPad. And while I once thought that was a positive, it obviously is a huge design flaw which will damage your very expensive tablet. Thank goodness I opted for AppleCare on mine, so it was a relatively painless device swap. BUYER BEWARE; you will risk bending using this case for prolonged amount of time.

For this product, they don't, the top of the round mold is so thin and light weight that it simply floats off, there is no mechanism to join the two they simply sit one on top of the other. For a mold this is an exceptionally poor design. The square mold suffers the same issue, its so thin walled and flimsy that it cannot hold its own shape even when full of water. If you are extremely careful and have a flat perfectly level spot to place the square mold full of water with extreme care and you don't move too fast from the sink to the freezer you may be able to act with enough gentleness to not disturb it and possibly get an ice cube.

From the description on the product page you can't really tell what you'll get. I hope this review helps to deter anyone buying this game to only play in VR. Maybe this game is great in 2D but that's not what I was looking for. So, this game is more like Ace Combat 7 VR \"mode included\" where you play a few VR levels but not the actual game, and not at all like Resident Evil Biohazard VR \"mode included\", where you play the entire game in VR but have to watch a few cutscenes in 2D. I think Sony needs to come up with a third tier of branding for VR games like this...maybe say \"VR Content Included\", which would signify that you can't play the game in VR but you can do extra stuff that you'll need a VR headset/camera for.

But these things collect lint like crazy. They're black and you can clearly see these little gray/white balls of lint all over them from a distance away. I'm not sure if its the material or what, but a lint roller wouldn't remove them and the leggings seem to collect more the longer I have them. Because of this I cannot wear them out, just around the house. It's such a shame. Besides that they are ok.

The product isn’t good, it doesn’t work, it’s a waste of money, period. I bought this to make grinding weed faster...or so I thought. This device is probably best used for herbs and spices but not weed. This device doesn't allow for a good amount of weed to be put into it and you basically have to grind it down yourself to fit it in-between the teeth in order for the top piece to fit back on. So it holds very little herb. It gets stuck all the time and I constantly have to use the cleaning tool to get the weed out. I compared it to my handheld grinder and I got a lot more weed out of my handheld with a lot less hassle. It's a good concept but it just doesn't work well for weed. I also think it would be better if you could feed the weed through the cone-shaped top and then have it grind down instead. Because the reason I think this doesn't work is that in order for the top to go back on and work, you can only put in a minimal amount of weed and you must break it down into very small pieces which negates the entire reason I bought this. I am looking for a faster and easier way to grind a larger amount of weed at once. I would not recommend this for anyone looking to use it for weed. I can't say how it would be with other herbs and spices but since I have this, I may one day try it out for other use. Though I still think it will be more work since the area where you put the herb in is very tight and only allows a small amount inside in order to put the top piece back on.",

HOWEVER, the bristles are so stiff and tightly packed with rough flat edges that it might as well be a stiff wire brush or a block of metal or wood. Instead of dislodging coffee grounds from the machine's group head it is likely to push them up into the holes insuring serious clogging with repeated use. It's like shoving or pushing the grounds up into the tiny holes. The more you use it the worst it will be. A clogged machine will require profesional attention or expensive thorough cleaning. Ironically the stiff bristles come \"protected\" inside a plastic cap. Maybe is to protect the plastic bag from the brushes. Perhaps these might be good to clean a toilet bowl rim or the inside of metal drain pipes.

The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee).

As a last resort I switched to the large earbuds - what a difference! Once a true fit is found the sound quality is actually very good. The music never stopped or skipped over 8 hours while I did my yard work and they had approximately 40% charge left. I charged them overnight again then used them for a 2.5 mile walk. There were a few skips but I thought it might have been my stream. Then I used them for a 5 mile walk...they were dropping out every 20 mins or so and they earbuds seemed to lose pair with each other. First the right ear would drop, it would come back and immediately the left would drop for a second before reconnecting. The problem only got worse as I continued to use them. The last time I used them, I had them on for 2 hours and they skipped over 2 dozen times while the unpairing from right to left earbud happened at least 13 times.

Not sure how accurate it was but assumed it was good to go based on all the high reviews. Today for the second time in two years, I needed a torque wrench. I’ve had my Tekton stored in a closet in its protective case and at the lowest torque setting as per the manufacturer’s instructions. I needed 10 ft lb torque (the lowest setting on my wrench) to torque two swing arm spools. On the first, it came very close to stripping the bolt, and I never heard a click but decided to stop before it got completely stripped. I blamed myself and assumed I had my allen bit at an angle. On the second spool I slowly twisted the wrench and again, no click. What I did eventually hear was the bolt being sheared in half. I was able to twist the broken half out of the swing arm, but there’s some damage to the black paint of the swing arm on a 2018 Yamaha R6. I’m going to try to get the company that makes the spools to send two more bolts, in the event it was their hardware, but I have ordered a different brand of torque wrench to try. I have a feeling it’s the wrench that caused the issue, as many of the 1 star reviews mention sheared bolts and the wrench not clicking or working for very long. And that makes sense. It’s $35-40 and made in Asia. If you want a quality mechanics torque wrench you probably have to man up and pay at least $150 for a CDI or $500 for a Snap On. I bought this cause I’m not a full time mechanic, but I’d rather not have a torque wrench than have one I can’t trust to not destroy my vehicles.",

I’m not sure why that wasn’t something that could be done on their end since the item wasn’t shipped out or even had a label created yet. Fast forward to receiving the item (the day after I needed it) The suit is very cute and if the size was right would be very comfortable. I’m proportioned differently to where I would need a larger top than bottom. Once again I emailed to see about a possible exchange for a different size. At that point all I received back is “We cannot complete the requested exchange.” With that being said I went on to return the product and am being charged for the return, even though Kohl’s does free returns now?

I was really excited about this product because it could make popsicles so quickly and three different kinds if you wanted to suit the kids wishes, not that I'm a pushover mom or anything lol. But yeah when's the plastic casing broke off there's all kinds of ugly screws and everything else. It seems that the liquid inside is still maintained in its vessel.

All of the buttons have a plastic click that sounds like they are getting ready to snap . The knobs and faders are completely loose and have too much wobble when you move them and are unsatisfying to use. The actual audio quality of the was horrible. The self noise of the mixer is as loud as the mic. I really tried everything I could to make it sound decent but It didn't work. When I plugged my headset into the monitor there was a loud and obnoxious clicking sound and hiss. I tried it on a clean circuit and it still didn't go away.

I felt it was unsafe to consume the dispensed water. Detailed: I've ordered several DA29-00020B filters on Amazon prior to this recent order and never had an issue. This two pack of filters were a few dollars less than my original orders so I thought I'd gamble on saving a few dollars and hope to receive an adequate product. I gambled and lost. I installed the new filter cartridge in the same manner of my previous filters and read the instructions that came with the filter to flush it correctly. Per the instructions you are advised to run water through the dispenser for 6 minutes (3 gallons) to purge the system. I aired on the side of caution and dispensed 4 gallons of water in several batches into a measuring cup. I grabbed a clean drinking glass and filled it up and began to lift the glass to drink. That's when I noticed floating debris in the water. The best description I can give would be small pieces of transparent material... like plastic were swirling around in my glass. I fished a couple pieces out with my finger to feel the texture, but it didn't feel like anything... but I could clearly see the debris in my hand as I moved it around. As for the size of the debris... it varied, but the larger pieces I'd estimate as half the size of the letter \"O\" on a standard keyboard... I don't know what else I could compare the size to that would be comparable for other customers. I decided to flush more water through the dispenser with a new glass. I told myself, maybe the glass I used had something in it... Well, that wasn't the case, after flushing an additional 5 gallons of water through the dispenser, I still had floating debris in my water. Now, each time I dispensed water, I checked it, and the debris did seem to be reducing...but it was still a lot. At this point I've dispensed nearly 10 gallons of water, which I saved for alternative use, like my humidifiers and to water plants... but I felt I would never be able to flush all the debris out of the system with out eventually wasting water. I don't want to spend half the life the cartridge on flushing the debris out of it... I requested a refund and received it immediately. I never tried the second filter that came in the order, I didn't want to take the chance of wasting water, nor my time. I'll be ordering the same model filter again, but from a different manufacturer.",

I called them and was informed they hadnt sold on amazon for over 3 year. CS also tried to have me return them for a refund.

From what I could tell the fabric was also very thin and would have shown my butt crack, provided I could get it up that far. The next two suits were black with pretty coral flowers. These were sized a bit more appropriately. I could get the XL onto my body, but it wasn't pretty! The hips came up so high that they showed that ugly fatty part above my leg. The boob cups were made for someone with an A-cup and were very firm and cone shaped. My girls were spilling out of both sides because the cups didn't allow them to fit naturally. The last suit was black with red flowers and fit fairly well. I could at least get it on and the hip line was perfect. As I was pulling it up I heard a few stitches pop and when I adjusted the ladies I noticed that the boob panels were sewn off center giving the chest a very lopsided effect. The boob cups were better size and of a softer material that the previous suit however they were not sewn in and migrated all over the chest panel as I moved.

The bail used on the cross is more substantial than the rest of the cross in terms of thickness and weight. There's cardboard thicker than this cross. It appears that it will get bent easily. I worry that the bail will snap the pendant-loop because the loop is severely thin. Use caution on this fragile piece. AUTHENTICITY: No 10k gold stamp found. No certification cards included in the shipment. I will bring this piece to a jeweler to verify.... Otherwise, this cross only reminds me of costume jewelry. DELIVERY: Arrived fast! However, shipping label does say Claddagh Gold and there are instructions to leave it if no response, making it an easy target for someone to steal it!!!! Luckily, the carrier put it in the mailbox, but the label saying the shipper's name does not help. In past experience, things worth of value require signatures. PRICE: Not worth $50.

There were way too many attempts with the first screen protector that I ended up having to go for the second one. I was already devastated because this has never happened to me before usually I can have a back up protector. So I had my brother attempt to put on the second one because I thought there was something wrong with me, but It turns out the second screen protector had bad alignment too and the massive amount of air bubbles are still there in the middle of the screen and all around the brother of the phone. I know that having all the air bubbles around the phone are going to make the screen protector come off quicker, and it makes the phone look bad and messy.

Only problem is, the faults on this machine don't go away. If you work really hard you might get a warm cup of coffee so if you like it hot, it's not going to happen. UPDATE: After using this machine for 3 months and still getting lukewarm coffee, now the portafilter keeps getting stuck in the machine.

It has two mounting options out of the box: Dash mount and vent mount. The dash mount option is surprisingly excellent - it comes with a really sticky adhesive that really does grip most dash materials, making for a great alternative to hogging an A/C vent in warmer climates. The clamping solution is great: Its electronic, and thus, automatically opens when your vehicle provides power or when you touch the bottom of the device. It automatically closes when your phone is placed against the back plate, touching the aforementioned bottom piece from within. My only \"complaint\" is that the device doesn't automatically open when power is cut to the mount.

I do NOT love the fact that I have to reconnect my TV/havit to the speaker every time I turn the devices on. I use the bluetooth speaker instead of the speakers on my TV because the TV speakers are BEHIND the TV so it makes hearing what's on nearly impossible unless the volume is up all the way. Having the bluetooth speaker close to where I'm sitting is great because I don't have to blast the sound. I just wish I didn't have to reconnect it every time.",

As I read it, I didn't remember who wrote these two books but my immediate assumption was that there were different authors for each of them. I was shocked to see that James had written both. The obvious difference is that Nancy Holder co-authored the first one & in this book James was solo. The absence of a female perspective is obvious & is at the heart of why this book bothers me so much. Most of the characters are a shadow of their former selves. Obviously Jayne is at the heart of the book & the two main protagonists, Temperance & Vandal, get the majority of coverage but what really made this book so unpleasant was the disdain for women & violence against them. Firefly (series) & Serenity (movie), like the wild west, were violent but the female characters OWNED their destinies. Not in this book. It felt like this book was written by a man who doesn't respect women. This isn't just about Jayne & the sociopath Vandal being \"done wrong\" by a woman & that is the root of their behavior. Throughout the book is a series of violations against women. The female characters have some agency in the resolution but it's really the men who save the day & rescue them. This book left a terrible taste in my mouth & I am relieved that James isn't writing the next book, \"Generations.\" If he writes additional Firefly books, he needs a female co-author. If there isn't one, I won't be reading it.",

Its cheaper to go to a real shop and have them use their film which looks better because its not a black sticker.

Moreover, the quality, loft, and general softness of these towels is much closer to that of a bargain bin Walmart towel than that of any 'Turkish Cotton' hand towels you've ever seen.

The device does not lock onto the stand - it will fall off at the slightest bump. The mounting plate attaches to the device at a 90 degree angle, yet the tilting joint on the arm only has a 15 degree range of motion, ensuring that the device cannot be pointed directly at the viewing surface under any circumstance. The zoom cannot be adjusted - the default zoom setting is the only setting. The software crashes regularly, forcing you to push the \"sharp objects button.\" (They meant reset. The Engrish is good for a laugh at least xD) I literally cannot think of a single good thing to say about this device. I am offended that it was put on the market by anyone.

Then, it started randomly not cutting deep enough sometimes. Then it started not cutting at all.

It's a good thing I had the day off because it took forever to figure it out but they agreed to send me a new machine. I had to pay to ship the defective machine back though (WHY?). I got the new machine and I was so happy to finally be doing work with a machine that was not defective expect just a few days later the new machine started having the same issues! The auto-blade will not adjust the blade correctly and it will get stuck at 0 and not cut. The workaround I found was to set the blade manually and change the auto-blade settings to ratchet blade. After all, I'm only cutting stickers, I don't need the blade settings to constantly change. Well... now the new machine is not registering the registration marks even though they are black marks on white sticker paper! And sometimes it registers them but the cuts are completely off.

The drinking glass and dish I attempted to dry was still wet and covered with copious amount of lint/fibres both inside and outside of the glass. The end result was similar to attempting to dry a glass using a synthetic or plastic cloth. I had to use an older dish towel from my stash to dry the glass and dish off and obtained superior results! I am very unhappy with these towels. I intended to send them back for a full refund however my husband informed me that it was too late to return them because of a 30 day return policy.

I determined the cause to be a necessary software update, which then wouldn't process due to an incompatibility with a new version of iOS. Two weeks later, I got my mug updated and got to use it. My first experience was putting coffee into the mug, lid closed. I kept the liquid under the \"Fill Line\" as instructed, and when my drink reached temperature and I went to open it to drink, the lid \"popped\" violently, and sprayed liquid everywhere. If you travel with this lid and use it in the closed position, expect to have to force the lid open and have liquid spray out in all directions. It's not a rare occurrence with regular use. The experience, upon using the mug, was nothing exceptional. It would keep drinks warm for about two hours, set to a specific temperature. But, unless it's plugged into its charging pad, I've found it will occasionally \"forget\" to keep the drink warm. I'll tap the logo, the mug will light up and inform me my drink has dropped twenty degrees from where I had it set, and it has to try to warm it up. Not quite the experience I expected, but it's not a major issue. Then, the lid broke. The lid is a ring in the center of the mug, and you have to depress it, where it latches and stays open to allow you to drink. My lid broke such that the lid would no longer latch into place, and would rock off to one side or the other, so that I could either get no liquid out at all, if the lid were centered, or I could get a sporadic and slow trickle of liquid out by getting the lid stuck inside itself. I contacted them and was summarily shipped a replacement lid, and I thought perhaps it would be a fluke. I got the lid, and continued as normal. In this time, the mug would often (probably 8 times out of 10) refuse to turn on without first being touched to the charger. Again, not a great experience for a $150 coffee mug. Then, just now, my second lid broke. I'm going to have to contact customer support again, and see if they'll ship me another lid. All this has occurred since September 2017, a five-month period. Not the level of quality I would presume to get from such an expensive luxury product, but I'll have to consider this a lesson learned.

You cannot get this seat tight, the latches are merely metal clips that bend too easy, and the base being flimsy only gets worse. My daughter sways in the back the whole time we drive. I’m actually trading this seat in to be recycled and replacing with another Graco. No way in heck this would last long term or in an accident. Not worth the risk! I purchased this seat to compare to a graco 4 ever all in one for quality and also fit. I have a 2014 Chevrolet 1500 crew cab truck, so space is tight from the rear facing seat to the back of the front seat. After having these seats side by side, I have to say the graco is worth every penny. It’s very solid in construction, no wobbling, quality fabrics. The plastics are quite a bit sturdier and not flimsy whatsoever. I don’t have any doubt that the 4 ever seat will last 10 Years. The safety first is a good seat, it’s just not on the level of the graco. The plastics are noticeably thinner, slight wobble, the fabrics are softer but don’t keep their shape (it came with the headrest crumpled up) and are warmer than the graco, something important to keep in mind for our Texas weather. The base on the safety first is narrow and sways on hard floor or car seats no matter how tight the belt is. For being taller in height, I’m surprised to find that the graco fits better in my truck. The safety first takes more room reclined, and has many less recline options. It’s also wider than the graco. Had my daughter not spit up on the safety first as I was testing it, I would return it and get another graco. The difference in price is well worth the quality. When it comes to budget, I just don’t think car safety is the pace to trim dollars. It’s important to note that the graco can serve as a backless booster and handle 20 pounds more. I’m hoping the safety first will last as a secondary seat, but for those shopping for a primary seat, please save your dollars and invest in the 4 ever. My vehicle and my husbands have quite a few safety features that not all vehicles may have, which is the only reason I’m comfortable keeping this seat.",

If this is the remote you want, buy directly from the manufacturer who will cooperate with you should a faulty item be sent your way as opposed to a third-party seller.

Well, I found out why someone returned the item in the first place. The heating elements on the inside of both slots did not work. They would only toast one side. Before I realized this I tried using the bagel setting. That only burnt the outside and did not toast the inside. Isn't that the whole purpose of a bagel setting? To toast the inside and not the outside? I understand that even the best products can turn out to lemons from time to time but I feel like this company knowingly tried to deceive me by selling me a used defective toaster.

Due to it position (the seam where the pillow is put together) it can not be patched. The pillow deflates in less than 10 minutes without there even being weight or pressure on it. Since it was a couple of months ago, it says the product is ineligible for return, yet it has not even been used once. I would have thought that this product for it price and reviews would have better manufacturing. A waste of $70.00 +",

As soon as I tried out the first game (Civilization VI) the fans on the card went straight to 100% and then would not ramp down after games was closed out. Used Gigabyte's software to try and turn the fans down with no luck. Look at a bunch of their forums and many people were having the same issue with no help from the Gigabyte. The only way to turn the fans off was to turn the system off. Restarting did not fix the issue, you had to shut the system down in order to turn the cards fans off. Additionally the fans are extremely loud when ramped to 100%. Returned for a different brand.",

Not because my son was rough with it but because they’re just cheap. The flashlight looks like it’s supposed to actually work, it has a place for a battery, but no bulb. The glasses are too wide for a child, or an adult for that matter. They couldn’t even stay on my husband’s head. All of the toys are very cheap plastic, which you can tell from the photos they have shown, but I didn’t realize how cheap. I thought for the price it would be somewhat sturdy. My son does love it though but he gets upset because they toys break. All the photos were taken about 20 mins after Amazon dropped it off. That’s how quick it fell apart.",
