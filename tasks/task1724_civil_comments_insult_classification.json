That the budget was ever allowed to grow to four billion is criminal in itself. The problem with restructuring the dividend is there are no checks and balances associated with government spending, we see what they've managed to accomplish thus far, give our children's future to the oil companies.

The gator stopped, looked over the situation and climbed the 6 ft fence straight up to get to the canal. So the boy had his feet in a foot of water, that is not swimming.

Enough is enough. Perhaps the hostile tax environment may be part of the reason that the economy is so services oriented in Oregon. A lot of the Fortune 500 companies have left. The problem with such a services-oriented economy is that it is not very flexible. So, when economic downturns come around every 8 years, or so, the Oregon and other services-oriented economies (e.g. Arizona) is hit harder than the national average; a lot of the money used to pay for those services is sourced from discretionary income.

There are two \"raises\" people talk about. 1)The multi-year contracts where employees get a raise intended to tread water with inflation. There have may -0- years and the Leg tried to defund the final contact year last session. Not exactly fair since that's the year the bulk of the 3.5% is assigned to. 2)The actual merit step you may be referring to are experience increases. The longer you work, the more you make. Generally SOA employees make significantly less for many years than private industry, but weigh several factors of employment. So, think of it as a wage scale for time and experience. You wouldn't work for your employer for the same wage as a HS student would you, but you'd probably expect raises the longer you worked.",

In decades past, the most commonly available ammunition were cartridges seated with ball or full metal jacket bullets...military grade. Now there are many more choices of cartridges made with expanding and frangible bullets that are more safe because they are designed to avoid over penetration and to create a large wound cavity that assures to a greater extent the debilitation of an attacker (or a victim).\nLet's not up the ante on gun control.

Its etymology is traced to discussion of \"more densely\" developed urban centers especially in reference to residential units.  In today's usage you might read \"modesly\" devloped city centers generally promote more affordable urban residential tenancy.   Indeed, it is an esoteric term and it's not surprising it causes some confusion.  \n\nYou may be thinking of \"scrupub\", which, in contemporary use, refers to policies and legislation designed to benefit a small special interest group by \"screwing the public.\"",

That aside, I would argue that all fields of knowledge have an ideology, though many strive to render it natural or invisible.

For example, a field of knowledge like natural science that many would say is fact not ideology embraces a materialist epistemology that runs counter to a spiritualist or religious epistemology. One sees truth revealed in an objective world from a process of observation and experiment. The other sees truth revealed from a divine source recorded in sacred texts by prophets.

For instance, in the case of the Eastmoreland sequoia lots (a story I imagine developers and sympathizers of this article scoffed at), the neighborhood offered a very viable plan to build two smaller houses on the property without clearcutting the land, along with compensation for preserving the trees.  Such houses would have been more affordable, and saved a valuable public resource: big trees.  This option was rejected because the developer didn't have kit houses of the right size and shape available.

Real classy those conservatives are. \n\nIf the conservative thinks government employment is so lucrative, he or she had ample opportunity to obtain one of those \"high paying, awesome benefits\" jobs. The fact they never did is their problem. Instead the rag-a-colic conservative does the bidding of the 1%ers by attacking other middle class Americans and thus demonstrating they are too ignorant to know who they should be mad at.

It smacks of favoritism, which pretty much shoots down any \"unity\" argument.\n\nPolitics is no longer about unwavering loyalty to The Party, and absolute, unquestioning support of The One favorite within that party. It's an \"all bets are off\" revolt against the trap that is a two party system. It can be quite an adjustment to accept that no one is required to support a candidate just because of party affiliation. \n\nYes, it's hard to deal with.
