    "Definition": "Turn the given fact into a question by a simple rearrangement of words. This typically involves replacing some part of the given fact by a WH word. For example, replacing subject of the provided fact with the word \"what\" can form a valid question.\nThings to avoid: 1. Don't be creative! You just need to rearrange the words to turn the fact into a question - easy! 2. Don't just randomly remove a word from the given fact to form a question. Remember your question must evaluate science understanding.\nEmphasis & Caution: 1. Pick a word or a phrase in the given fact to be the correct answer, then make the rest the question. 2. You can also form a question without any WH words. For example, \"A radio converts electricity into?\"",
