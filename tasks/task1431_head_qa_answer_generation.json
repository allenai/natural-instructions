The only attitude to take is to increase the minute volume in the anesthetic machine. <4> The placement of the orotracheal tube should be checked for the possibility that it has progressed and that we are facing an endobronchial intubation, which is relatively frequent in this surgery due to the elevation of the diaphragm secondary to the pneumoperitoneum. <5> Elevation of the teleespiratory carbon dioxide, without affecting ventilation pressures, is typical of massive pulmonary embolism.
