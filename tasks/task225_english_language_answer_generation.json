Therefore, 'to denigrate someone' would be 'to blacken that person'. Considering its current definition (see below) and the wish to be politically correct, I wonder whether the word has come to acquire any racist overtone. The reason why I'm asking is because I was reading 'Language Myths' a book by Laurie Bauer recently, and came across this passage which contained that word '...certain educational institutions denigrate the way certain ethnic minorities and lower-working-class children talk.' Then I remembered I was once told not to use 'denigrate' as it might be misinterpreted by some people. denigrate - from Merriam-Webster 1. to say very critical and often unfair things about (someone) 2. to attack the reputation of, to deny the importance or validity of, belittle EDIT (on Dec 17th, 2017) - This article, Dark Words Of Disapproval which Mari-Lou A mentions in one of the comments, shows very clearly the writer's feelings about this word, with very good arguments to bear him out. Then again, there are those who think otherwise. For one, Melvin B. Tolson, the character played by Denzel Washington in the 2007 feature film 'The Great Debaters', says the word has racist undertones. - Edit (on May 6th, 2020).",
            "output": [
                "I don't see why this question has received such negative responses. I think it's a good question. 'Blacken' indeed has a trans-historical meaning associated with vilification or corruption, but this has nothing to do with the inherent qualities of black people, animals, or the vast majority of black things. Would you consider the term 'blacklist' racist? If not, then you shouldn't see 'denigrate' as racist. Anyone who does is being a little silly. If you're worried, you could always replace it with 'disparage.' EDIT: Another example is use of the term 'sinister' to mean 'wicked.' This word comes from Latin 'sinister,' meaning 'left' or 'on the left side.' Over time, the mythologized connection of the left hand to the false or unfavorable came to give 'sinister' an association with the unsavory. This does not mean that we cannot use 'sinister' to mean 'wicked,' or that doing so would impugn left-handed people."

But, like with fashion, there is very little objective truth to my judgment about any of it. I try not to actually challenge people on uses that bother me; aside from the arbitrariness of language, every bit of evidence suggests that stopping language change in any significant way is like going to the beach and trying to stop the tide from coming in. There was a more in-depth discussion about this in a previous question. That said, I do believe there is a certain time and place where standards and clarity are important. In formal contexts, information is often supposed to be presented in a certain way, and, generally, these conventions benefit everyone.

There isn't actually a clear way to identify which sounds in a word correspond to which letters: for example, rough, which you say has letters for 'each of the sounds', could be analyzed as r- + -ou- + -gh or as r- + -o- + ugh. When similar issues arise with other words, it makes it pretty subjective to decide whether the word has consonant sounds that 'aren't part of the spelling' or that just have an complex relationship to the spelling. Some words that could be considered to meet your criteria: Consonants Any word with an epenthetic voiceless plosive between a nasal and a following consonant. For many speakers, a productive process causes a sound like /t/, /p/ or /k/ to be inserted after the sounds /n/, /m/ or // respectively in various environments. In most words, the epenthetic plosive is not written, so you could say that there is a /p/ in the pronunciation but not the spelling of warmth, dreamt, hamster, seamstress, a /t/ in the pronunciation but not the spelling of sense, glance, a /k/ in the pronunciation but not the spelling of strength, angst. In eighth and in one pronunciation of threshold, a digraph that usually represents a single sound corresponds instead to two sounds: /t/ and /h/ respectively. You could say that the /t/ in eighth or the /h/ in that pronunciation of threshold isn't part of the spelling. Something similar applies for speakers who use the pronunciation /hat/ instead of /hat/: whether it's spelled height or heighth, it seems like one of the two sounds at the end is not explicitly represented in the spelling. In some accents of British English, the vowels found in words like saw and draw is regularly followed by epenthetic /r/ before another vowel. This means that the words sawing and drawing are pronounced with an /r/ that 'isn't part of the spelling'. Vowels or syllables Many words with syllabic resonants, or sequences of a schwa followed by a resonant, have no particular letter that marks the syllabicity. Words ending in -thm or -sm are the most obvious example. Other examples are more dialect dependent, but words like hour are disyllabic for some speakers."

Prescriptive grammars have traditionally condemned a third use of like, the use 'as a conjunction' where it is followed by a clause (e.g. 'like Maria does') rather than by a noun phrase. However, as the comments point out, that construction would allow you to express 'How do you solve problems the way that Maria solves problems' without ambiguity. Many modern linguists analyze like as a preposition when it takes a bare noun phrase like 'Maria' as its complement (although like is not always a preposition, and even when it is, it doesn't always behave exactly the same way as other prepositions). The same kind of ambiguity is seen with many prepositional phrases, as illustrated by the joke 'One morning, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know,' which relies on this ambiguity. You can see further examples and discussion in the answers to Does 'I am eating vegan cheese in my underpants' really imply that the vegan cheese is inside my underpants?

            "input": "I saw an article today that prompted a thought. I only took a year of Latin in high school, so I want to run this by some other people. The article referenced a female senator so-and-so. However, I think that senator, with the -or ending is in the nominative, third declension, which is not gender neutral. So, when referring to a female subject, should senatrix be used instead? Also, does anyone know if there is a reason why the male form is used exclusively? I think females were restricted from the Roman senate perhaps the term just never made sense etymologically because of this?.",
            "output": [
                "A number of answers have addressed the fact that in the United States, the use of gender-specific nouns is becoming less fashionable. However, that does not explain why a female equivalent of senator has never existed, only why if it did exist once, it might be less favoured now. I try to answer the etymological question here in relation to senatrix. There is no classical support for senatrix. The word senator was, both originally in English and in Latin, an expression referring exclusively to males, simply for the unfortunate dearth of female senators. In classical Rome, a senator (Latin senator) was always a man, and when the word later came to be used to refer to members of foreign legislatures, to my knowledge all such references were to men. Indeed senator itself essentially meant 'elderly man', from senex, 'old, elderly'. The obvious female equivalent, senatrix, does appear in Lewis & Short, but a brief search on Perseus suggests it is not attested in any major classical source. Of course, Rome had two famous female senators in the tenth century mediaeval senate (or what was left of it), and indeed senatrix was the formal title used by Theorda and Marozia, her daughter*. But they are an anomaly, and were I think of little interest when the word senator was imported into English and first popularized. Therefore we begin with a situation in which anyone who read Latin would know that senatrix was not a classical word, and those of us who delight in imposing arcane Latin grammar rules on unsuspecting English speakers are equally reluctant to pollute the lexicon with artificial Latin words [and anything after August 476 AD doesn't count]. On the use of senatrice in French. The French word sometimes used for a female senator (senatrice) appears to be a backformation from senateur + -trice rather than derived directly from *senatrix. That said, senatrice is long established in the French language, appearing in the 1762 edition of the dictionnaire de L'Academie francaise. This is curious, as in 1762 the ancien regime remained strong and the date long precedes the the establishment of the French Senat in 1799. However my knowledge of French and France is embarrassingly poor, so all I shall say is that 1762 is long after the word senator appeared in English. Therefore senator had become an English word by this time, and I suggest that the continuing evolution of its cognate in French would have had limited effect on the use of senator in English. The Academie francaise now discourages the use of senatrice. There is little use of senatrix at any time in English. A Google Ngram search reveals that senatrix did have a brief period of use in the early twentieth century, around the time that the notion of female senators entered the public discourse. However, a more detailed inspection reveals that this seems to be an upswing in interest about Theodora and Marozia, rather than in the composition of the modern legislature. In that search I did find one tantalizing reference to the 'senatrix from Kansas', but as the reference dates from 1898, eighty years before the first female senator from Kansas, and is entitled 'Judge's Library: A Monthly Magazine of Fun', it cannot be taken at face value. senatrix has little in the way of a history and less in the way of a future. Lacking a sound etymological past, senatrix was not popular among those most likely to have adopted it; and until 1932 there was regrettably very little need for the word to be used at all in popular discourse. As the other answers carefully elucidate, in English, particularly American English, there is a trend away from long-established gender-specific words, so it seems quite unlikely we will see the adoption of any artificial ones any time soon. *You may recall that Gibbon famously describes them in Decline and Fall as 'sister prostitutes', but later sources are quite clear that they were mother and daughter. Gibbon does not use the word senatrix as far as I can see."

                "'I and someone are interested' is grammatically correct. It is the convention in English that when you list several people including yourself, you put yourself last, so you really should say 'Someone and I are interested.' 'Someone and I' is the subject of the sentence, so you should use the subjective case 'I' rather than the objective 'me'. 'Someone and I' clearly means two people, so you should use 'are' and not 'is'. If it was 'Someone or I ...' then you would use 'is', because only one person is interested, either 'someone' or 'I'. It is not uncommon to hear people say 'Me and someone are ...', but this is wrong because it's the wrong case. When an educated person hears 'Me and Billy is going to the ball game', he immediately thinks this is either a child or a very uneducated person speaking. 'I and someone we ...' is incorrect because it is redundant. 'We' is simply another way of saying 'I and someone'. It adds no new information to the sentence, and so there is no reason to include it. You can't just string together alternative ways of expressing the same idea: If you really need it for clarity or emphasis, you have to surround it with some additional words, like a 'that is', or sometimes just punctuation that show its purpose in the sentence. You could say, 'We, that is, Bob and I, are interested ...' All that said, 'I and someone' or 'Someone and I' sounds strange to me, and I suspect most English speakers, because it is an unusual use of the word 'someone'. When 'someone' is used in a list with identifiers of other people, we usually say 'someone else'. Like, 'Bob and someone else are interested ...' rather than 'Bob and someone are interested ...' (I have no idea why this is so; it's just the convention.) 'Someone' without 'else' is normally only used when it's the only person: 'Someone is interesteed ...'"

                "Traditional grammarians prefer the nominative ('she') for the complement of the verb 'to be'. Most usage in my experience prefers the accusative ('her') and regards the verb as having a direct object rather than a complement. I suspect the traditional grammarians, as they often did, have misapplied a rule of Latin grammar. In Latin, 'esse' takes a complement in the nominative case, but Latin declines the verb strongly enough that it doesn't bother with a pronoun as the subject of a verb unless needed for emphasis. 'It is she' in Latin would be 'illa id est', which looks far more natural than the English. Note that it's 'c'est lui' in French, so there isn't a general rule for a complement of 'to be' being in the nominative. Explanation: A normal (transitive) verb, like say 'have' has a direct object, which is in the accusative case. So, for example, 'I have her' uses 'her' as a direct object, and 'her' is in the accusative case, where 'she' is in the nominative case. In Latin, the verb 'esse' ('to be') is special; it doesn't have a direct object in the accusative case, it has a complement in the nominative case. English grammarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries adopted a number of rules of Latin grammar into English; this was one of them. In Latin, 'it is she' and 'she is it' are both the same thing 'id illa est' or 'illa id est' can both be translated either way - the point being that the 'is' ('est') just equates to things to each other - it's like in maths you can have x=y or y=x and they both mean the same thing. English, though, takes word-order very seriously, and a pronoun after a verb is very strongly marked as being in the objective case and you don't get the benefit that you get in Latin from the exception - there's still one before the verb and one after; you don't get to make clear that it's commutative. So you have a special-case for a verb, which you get no useful benefit from. It's hardly surprising that most English speakers have reverted to 'it is her' rather than 'it is she'. A note on cases: Latin is conventionally described as having seven cases (though only five are actually different for most nouns and pronouns). It has two cases, accusative and dative for the objects of verbs. English's residual case system only has the one case for both, which merge into the objective case (in fact, a third Latin case, ablative, merges in too). That's why the two paragraphs above appear to use two different words for the same case."

A sneaky solution can be to put 'its' and 'it's' in quotes in the sentence, to come up with something like: 'I wrote a sentence with 'it's' and 'its' in it.' = 'I wrote a sentence with 'its' and 'it's' in it.' We can spell something incorrectly, as Hans Adler ironically points out in the most downvoted answer. Or, as my girlfriend suggested, we can replace the 'it' in the contraction 'it's' with a proper noun (like that clever guy Stephen King did), making 'it's' refer to something that belongs to someone or something named It. In this case the solution becomes again trivial, since 'its' is also a possessive. 'This clown is named It. It's nose is red.' = 'This clown is named It. Its nose is red' (we sadly, in the last case, refer to a clown as an object, but it does have the same meaning) Alternatively All of these answers, to me, are trivial and make the puzzle somewhat boring. If we don't want the puzzle to be boring, we can't cut corners. In this case, as a few have pointed out, it is most likely impossible."

An ornamental symbol used as section break does not have a generally accepted name.

            "output": [
                "The dictionaries I've checked seem to be unanimous that the plural of the noun 'go' is 'goes'. I didn't see one list its plural as 'gos'. However, I didn't check all dictionaries. American Heritage Dictionary: n. pl. goes Collins Dictionary: n, pl goes Merriam-Webster Dictionary: plural goes Cambridge Dictionary: plural goes Random House Unabridged Dictionary (dictionary.com): plural goes Google NGram Viewer does not show any results for 'two gos at' or 'two gos at', but does when written as 'goes'. A Google search shows the following results: 'two gos at' = 453 results. 'two goes at' = 19,500 results. 'three gos at' = 252 results. 'three goes at' = 20,200 results. Note that both Google search and Ngram Viewer may show false positives, as Google search, as far as I know, doesn't take punctuation into account when giving search results, ie., full stops, commas. But I think it's safe to assume the consensus is that the plural of go (attempt or try) is 'goes'. I think this is a good question, as somewhere in my head I have an instinct to write it 'gos'. However the answer is gotten easily by checking some dictionaries. Also, if you wrote 'I had three gos at it before giving up', I have a feeling the typical reader probably wouldn't even be surprised by it or notice it particularly as wrong. This is just my opinion. I have this feeling because the '-os'/'-oes' plural ending rules are wildly inconsistent. Potatoes, tomatoes and heroes are correct. But 'photos' and 'burritos' are correct. However most dictionaries seem to list either '-os' or '-oes' ending as acceptable in 'ghetto' and 'mosquito'. Both 'mosquito' and 'burrito' most likely come from Spanish, yet most dictionaries say only 'mosquito' can have plural ending either '-os' or 'oes', whereas they're consistent in listing '-os' for burrito plural. Same goes for 'canto', 'manifesto' and 'grotto'. These words most likely come from Italian, yet the plural of 'canto' is 'cantos', whereas the dictionaries say the plural of 'grotto' or 'manifesto' can end in either '-os' or '-oes'. Addendum As some people have claimed that the rules for -os or -oes plural endings are quite consistent (and I happen to disagree), I've included more examples to show just how unpredictable this can get. The claim generally is basically that borrowed words or imported words from other languages have -os as their endings and most everything else has -oes. The more specific claim is this rule applies for words from Romance languages specifically. embargo (Spanish): Dictionaries show only -oes plural. NGrams show -oes much more common. tornado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes much more common. desperado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes more common. cargo (Spanish) plural possibly as the pants: Dictionaries show either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes more common. mango (Portuguese): Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. domino (uncertain exactly which language, but a Romance one, or maybe directly from Latin): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. volcano (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. motto (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes to be more common. Words taken directly from Latin many times have -oes plural ending, but not always: veto has plural vetoes torpedo has plural torpedoes However memento overwhelmingly has plural mementos. And embryo is always embryos. Echo, directly from Greek, has plural 'echoes'. hello (native English): Nearly always 'hellos'. no (native English): Much more common as 'nos', ie., 'yeses and nos'. do (native English): Dictionaries give plural as either 'dos' or 'do's'. The results for searches of these terms would be confounding to say the least. weirdo (native English): some dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os is much more popular Unknown origin: hobo: Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams show roughly same frequency. gizmo: = Dictionaries only give -os, 'gizmoes' doesn't show anything in NGrams. gazebo: Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os more common. So I don't know about anyone else, but I personally need help, in many ways."

                "Warning, large amount of explanation, if you simply are looking for the answer, skip to the next bolded area. When asking such a question, think about all the possible outcomes and parties involved, and try to find a middle ground that has the least potential to offend all parties the least. So in this case, it's a pretty polar issue, you have typical gendered people, such as males that identify as males and females that identify as females, and atypical gendered people, such as those having undergone sex changes, those who simply prefer to be refered to as the opposite gender, those that are both male and female and so on. Regarding typical gendered people, you have three distinct categories in regards to how they might take this question. You have those who are comfortable with their own gender and are relatively passive or supportive of gender issues. These ones are unlikely to be offended no matter how you word your question. You also have those who are not comfortable with their own gender, whether it be perhaps a male with a somewhat feminine voice or appearance, a masculine looking female or such. These ones are likely to be your toughest cookie, as it is entirely possible that no matter how well you word your question, it's entirely possible they might still be offended. This is the kind of people Kristina's question seems to be worded to specifically try and not offend, with the combination of apology and statement of obviousness. Thirdly, there are those who are comfortable with their own gender, but are against gender issues. These ones aren't likely to be offended, but may comment that such questions are ridiculous or something to similar effect. On the other hand, there are two distinct categories I can think of in regards to how atypical gendered people may take this question. The first is atypical gendered people who understand that gender issues are an ongoing debate, and that not everyone is comfortable with atypical gendered people yet. These ones are similar to the first category of typical gendered people where they will be difficult to offend. Secondly, there are atypical gendered people who are relatively not as passive about gender issues. This category is likely to be offended by any possible cynicism or potentially negatively seen opinion about having to ask such a question. Breaking down the possible aspects of a question, we can fairly well evaluate which category has potential in general to be offended by each aspect. Firstly we have: 'What is your gender?' The second category of typical gendered people has a relatively high potential of being offended by this question, but this depends on how many previous questions there were and how they were worded. If there were 10-20 or so different, yet similar personal questions asked prior, it's entirely possible they may understand that you're simply going through a checklist style sheet and not be offended at all. 'Are you male or female?' This is a wording of the question that conflicts with potentially three categories. Both categories of atypical gendered people may be offended by this, or simply unable to answer in the expected response, because, as mentioned prior, there are cases where the person doesn't necessarily fall into either category. Black and white question wording for a potentially gray answer, no matter the rarity of a gray answer should usually be avoided. In addition, this still doesn't avoid the issue of the previous question regarding the second category of typical gendered people. 'I'm sorry, but company policy dictates that we ask this question: What is your gender?' A person who lies in the second category of atypical gender has the possibility of being offended by this, due to you apologizing for having to ask what, to them is a perfectly reasonable question. This does avoid potential issue with any typical gendered person, but it does raise another seperate issue of apologizing for carrying out a company's policy, which is generally frowned upon. 'As obvious as it may seem, company policy dictates that we ask what your gender is.' Generally, the term 'obvious' should be avoided whenever possible while asking a question. It is typically considered just as polite, if not moreso to ask a question without the word obvious than with. The word obvious implies an assumption of knowledge on one party's part or another, which is never a good thing to assume, and can lead to offending people with relative ease. The likely offended party in this case would be those in the second category of atypically gendered people. If you simply want the answer and not the full explanation, skip to here. Looking at all the possibilities and outcomes, there are several correct solutions, depending on you as a questioner and the format of the application questioning itself. If the application asks a large list of questions, it is relatively safe to simply ask the question in the same format as all previous questions, likely by asking: What is your gender? If you'd like, you can try and avoid more by phrasing the question like: What is your self-identified gender?, as this question makes no assumptions, nor does it sound like a question that could be easily assumed. If you as a questioner still feel uncomfortable about asking such a question, or it is one of only a few questions, it would probably be best to preface the whole questionaire with a statement along the lines of. Company policy dictates that I have to ask you a number of certain questions to ensure our records are correct. and then simply asking What is your gender? when you get to that point in the questionaire. The benefit of this is that it absolves you of any responsibility of the questions asked, but doesn't necessarily show any disagreement with the company's policy. In addition, this avoids raising any potential issue with one specific question. Apologies for the length of the answer, I know it should be a relatively simple issue, but with the wide variety of opinions in today's society, I feel that it's best to break down such an issue to its core. Hopefully this answers your question reasonably enough."

Calorie is a unit, yes, but it is a continuous unit (it is possible to have half a calorie, or 4.582394 calories). Since a calorie is such a small unit of energy compared to what it is usually used for (food energy and human metabolism), it is very seldom expressed in a fractional form and instead is rounded (usually to the nearest 10 or higher). Why then should 'fewer' be used with calorie instead of 'less'? Is there another relevant rule than just 'continuous quantities use 'less' and discrete quantities use 'fewer'?.",

It's divisible into further discrete units - half a calorie, in this case, is still a discrete unit. Using another example, you would have 'fewer' jars of peanut butter, even though someone might have eaten half of the peanut butter in some of the jars. You could even cut the entire jar in half, none of that matters, you still have fewer jars. And you also have less peanut butter, in the same way that fewer calories means less energy. The calorie corresponds to the jar, not to the peanut butter (that would correspond to the energy the calorie measures). It doesn't matter that there is 'less' peanut butter in some jars than in others any more than it would matter if some of the jars were a gallon in size, and some were just single-use jars with two tablespoons of peanut butter inside.

The word is perfectly, unimpeachably, 100% correct. It is a bit of an upscale, literary word though. It certainly is a 'term of art' in fields like linguistics, where it is used commonly to refer to syllables. I searched for the word in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, and divided the results by section: spoken, fiction, magazine, newspaper, and academic, and got these results: spoken: 10 fiction: 53 magazine: 55 newspaper: 36 academic: 93 total: 247 So, it is certainly used in all areas of English, with a moderate skew towards higher registers like academic writing. Depending on the intended audience, a writer contemplating using the word 'penultimate' should consider that there is a relatively high likelihood that word will not be understood. Instead of 'penultimate', the phrasing in common usage is either 'next to last' or 'second to last'. Both of those should be universally understood. Interestingly, Google Ngrams shows that the word 'penultimate' rose in usage (in published books) steadily from 1800 to about 1990, and since 1990 it has shown a steep dropoff, taking us back to usage levels from the late 1960s. The better-understood terms 'second to last' and 'next to last' are less common (again, though, in published booksGoogle Ngrams tells us nothing about spoken usage), with 'next to last' having more historical usage but a slow tapering off of usage since 1960 and 'second to last' increasing in usage from 1970 on, with both enjoying approximately the same usage today."

No. Then the question mark shouldn't have been there, since it ends a sentence. Right, I should expand on that rather than just be a grumpy old man. The capitalization rule that we care about here is that the first word of a sentence starts with a capital letter, so the question is really about what ends a sentence. The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full stop (or period if you're American), question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that '?' and '!' are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (':') isn't really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons, semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because it is starting a sentence. There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when '?' and '!' become non-terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker asks a question or makes an exclamation, the '?' or '!' doesn't have to be terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote. 'Should I write it like this?' he asked. 'Or perhaps like this?' The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It looks wrong at a first read, and engenders the sort of argument I had with Jason in the comments below! Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this? Going back to the examples, and adding a few more for fun: Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that? 'Should I write it like this?' he asked, 'or perhaps like that?' Example 2 with the lowercase 'or' is just plain wrong. Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work. Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That is obvious in this case because the two questions really are tightly coupled alternatives. However, consider the following: Are the lights green? Or is the switch up? Are the lights green, or is the switch up? Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an absolute rule, but it is quite strongly implied. Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the quotes, what you get is: Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? which is our duff example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of: 'Should I write it like this?' he asked. 'Or perhaps like this?' (i.e. example 1) 'Should I write it like this,' he asked, 'or perhaps like that? (i.e. example 3) depending this time on how much of a break there is supposed to be in the middle of what was said. But speech-marking is a topic for another question :-) Exclamation marks work just like question marks for this purpose! Semicolons don't; they end a clause, not a sentence."

You should be able to find copies of at least one of the major ones in any decent University library. (At least at any decent University with English classes.) The Elements of Style by Strunk and White is the 'gold standard' for many Americans, although there are many who disagree with many of the details. The Chicago Manual of Style is a well-used standard for (American) University usage. - The online version is unapologetic and direct on this topic: 'The possessive of most singular nouns is formed by adding an apostrophe and an s', although it does go into more details. Fowler's modern English usage by Henry Fowler is also a well-regarded standard, particularly for British users. The Cambridge Guide to English Usage by Pam Peters has the benefit of the 'authority' of Cambridge. Oxford, of course, has their own: The New Oxford Style Manual, though the title has varied with edition. If physical copies aren't something you're interested in, a number of organizations (particularly journalism houses) have their house style guides online. For example, the Economist makes no mention of the conjectured rule in its advice. The Guardian gives additional examples, and also completely omits the purported rule. Others can likely be found by searching, and other major organizations (like the Associate Press and the New York Times) have theirs as printed books. Many dictionaries also have usage notes in them. (In particular, I'll point out the comment from @ps2goat mentioning Oxford Dictionaries's online page.) Ultimately, though, it's exceedingly difficult to prove a negative. Even confronted with evidence that a large number of style guides and usage manuals for English have nothing approaching the purported rule, your professor might not be convinced that he is mistaken. If that is the case, your best choice is probably to reword things to avoid the issue."

Non- is not a word, but a part of another word, usually a descriptive adjective: non-lethal, non-professional, non-native, non-technical, non-playing (The hyphen is optional.) Each of these mean 'anything but ...' -- anything that doesn't kill you is non-lethal, anything that's not technical is non-technical, etc. This meaning contrasts with un- and in-, which refer to opposites instead of complements. No is half of the answer pair Yes/No, shading off vocally into Nah, Nuh-uh, and Uh-uh. But it can also quantify and negate any noun phrase: Some blade of grass ~ No blade of grass; One who saw it ~ No one who saw it. Not is the general negator for verb phrases, including predicate adjectives and nouns. In a verb phrase, not occurs immediately after the first auxiliary verb. If there is no auxiliary verb in the verb phrase, Do-Support supplies a form of do. Not is contracted whenever possible, with auxiliaries or subjects (especially pronouns): He's not interested ~ He isn't interested; She doesn't like it, but not *She not likes it. Any of these negatives (and many others) can negate a sentence, changing its truth value.

However, books used to be made by folding sheets of paper larger than the page size and they would be sold without trimming the edges, so when you got your new book, it would be 'unopened' meaning that you couldn't turn the pages. You had to 'open' the book with a dull knife (like a letter opener) by ripping along the folds. (This is why some books have ragged edges of the text block, to evoke the memory of those ripped page edges.) The OED has e. transitive. To cut open the leaves of (a book) when they have been left joined along an edge during the making; to cut open (the leaves) of such a book.

Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration 'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!' A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.' A sword rang as it was drawn. 'Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.' 'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!' Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. 'But no living man am I!' -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular 'archaic'. I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the 'opinion-based' part of the question.",
            "output": [
                "The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's 'Westu Theoden hal!' taken directly from Beowulf's 'Ws u, Hrogar, hal', as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, 'On Translation' for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous 'tushery' (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter 'The Stewart and the King' from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the 'sudden joy as poignant as grief' of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic."

Etymonline says: a 'bright side' which proverbially accompanies even the darkest trouble; by 1843, apparently from oft-quoted lines from Milton's 'Comus,' where the silver lining is the light of the moon shining from behind the cloud. Was I deceived? or did a sable cloud Turn forth her silver lining on the night? I did not err, there does a sable cloud, Turn out her silver lining on the night And casts a gleam over this tufted grove. To which Thomas Warton added the commentary: 'When all succour eems to be lost, Heaven unexpectedly presents the ilver lining o a able cloud to the virtuous.'"

The Wikipedia article on the QUERTY keyboard shows that the ampersand was a separate key in the bottom left of the keyboard in the original patent application drawings. The patent was filed in 1878. The Das Keyboard blog shows a Full Duplex keyboard (with separate keys for upper and lower case letters) from 1897 with no ampersand key at all. I have not yet been able to find a reference to the first keyboard to place the ampersand and 7 together. The Wiki article on the ampersand only mentions that it is usually keyed via Shift+7, but occasionally on 6 or 8 instead. Dvorak layouts appear to share similar associations between 7 and &. So is it a coincidence? Or is there some association? 1 This looks really different in the EL&U site fontface. See the linked question or the Wikipedia article for more faithful renderings.",

' # $ % & ' ( ), which should give a good clue as to what the top row of a teletype keyboard looked like. On many early teletypes and terminals (and also, BTW, on the Apple ][), the shift key toggled bit 4 of the character being produced, thus it would turn a 1 (011 0001) into ! (010 0001), and , (010 1100) into < (011 1100). Since the digits 1-9 received consecutive code, so did the characters produced by combining them with the shift key. Shift-7 on those keyboards was apostrophe; the ampersand was shift-6. Other typewriter keyboards also varied considerably in where they put the ampersand. Its association with the number 7 is nowhere near as consistent as the association between 1 and !, 3 and #, 4 and $, or 5 and % which existed in both older computer keyboards and today's US arrangement."

But it's not going to get you the job in a competitive market. The awkward word choice and sentence construction is gone, although it still is passive and overly wordy.

The primary problem is that you're trying to evaluate your own suitability for the position. That simply won't fly. For one thing, it implies that the recruiter or HR department is redundant, which is going to make a bad impression on the first person to see your resume, even if it were true. Bigger issue: why would they trust your assessment, since you're obviously biased (you want them to offer you the job). My high school English teacher (English is my first language, so this was a writing course, not a foreign language course) gave the advice 'show, don't tell', and this applies in this situation. Don't tell them 'My profile matches the requirements.' or 'My experience matches the requirements.' Instead pull a couple highlights from your resume that you feel give you the necessary background, and say something like 'I look forward to applying my experience taking notes in class to making sure your medical records are clear and concise and don't miss any important details.' Of course, you should talk about your actual experience and the tasks that you will do in the position you are applying for. Same thing goes for expressing interest in the position. You did some research on what the company does, right? You don't want to say, 'I'm interested in this position because it meets my career goals.' Instead, 'I'm excited about joining your team that is on the cutting edge of research in whatever.' or 'I feel that the work your company does in providing education to the unemployed is vitally important. I would love to help give people a second chance at life.' Make it specific to the work this position entails, and your prior related experience. Let them draw the conclusion that you're a good fit. If you want to make it easy for the recruiter to check that you meet the requirements, use a highlighter on your resume. But that's not what a cover letter is for."

For many years the technology magazines where I worked enforced a strict house rule: e-mail (and later email) referred to 'electronic mail' as a mode of communication, and individual messages had to be termed 'e-mail [or email] messages.' But three or four years ago, the overwhelming weight of popular usage prevailed, and we began to accept the use of email as a singular noun that could take an indefinite article, and emails as a plural nounboth referring to individual messages. It is probably not coincidental that other forms of electronic communication receive similar treatment in popular (and some publishing) usage: a text and texts for 'a text message' and 'text messages,' respectively; and an IM and IMs for 'an instant messaging message' and 'instant messaging messages' (as I recall, people used to avoid 'instant messaging message' by conflating the technology with the individual message to produce 'instant message'). At publishing houses, the proper handling of 'an e-mail [or email]' versus 'an e-mail [or email] message' remains a house style issuethere is no universally agreed-upon preference. If you are beholden to no one's style guide, you are free to use the wording that you like better.

Lawrence.1 It's a little dated (2000), but also cites studies from 1993 and earlier describing this phenomenon. The recent history of American English includes a sound change that seems to have gone unattested in the scholarly literature.1 This is the change of /s/ to // before /tr/ (i.e., a PHONEMIC CHANGE), which involves a palatalization of the initial sound in the cluster /str/, typically in initial position but not exclusively. The author further mentions that 'this phonemic change seems to be neither dialectal nor regional.' However, it's definitely an American English peculiarity. It seems that it was first heard on television or radio broadcasts and became popular over these channels. Of course, the internet helps spreading such a linguistic 'oddity' and even I know I picked it up from television shows and continue to (subconciously) use this pronunciation. Regarding the phonetic principles behind this change, Lawrence summarizes: More concretely, this pronunciation is an implicit 'assertion' on their part that in their grammar /r/, being [+ interrupted], is marked with respect to the opposition INTERRUPTED versus CONTINUOUS - exactly the same way that [], being [+ compact], is marked with respect to the opposition COMPACT versus DIFFUSE. The marked character of /r/ is prompted and confirmed phonetically, of course, by its high degree of retroflection in American English.7 This would explain the fact that we only hear this in American English. What's interesting is that the same does not appear to happen to 'spr', which can be explained by the phonetic differences in 't' and 'p': I would surmise, therefore, that /str/ lends itself to realization as [tr] while /spr/ remains unaltered also due to the phonological value of /t/ and /p/. Another more recent paper was written by David Durian.2 It goes into the details of social background and 'shtr' as well as providing some more explanations for its development. 1 Lawrence, Wayne P.

You only otherwise have to keep a final silent e when adding able if it would (1) either change the pronunciation, or (2) it would cause a collision with an existing word that already means something else altogether different. The first case, pronunciation shift, is for things like raceable or purgeable, where losing the e would make the ce or ge switch from the 'soft' version to the 'hard' version due to the resulting g or c now being followed by an a rather than by an e, and cable and gable are pronounced quite differently. The second case, a collision with an existing word, occurs with such pairs as pareable / parable, placeable / placable, probeable / probable, and spareable / sparable. Notice how placeable also has the first factor in play, as too would singeable / singable. Beyond that, there is some slight variation in acceptable forms, such as both microwaveable / microwavable being attested. Normally however, you lose the e. The OED2 attests 1555 words than end in able but not in eable, while only 123 that do actually end in eable. That's a ratio of nearly 13 to 1 in favor of more able words without a preceding e.

However, this doesn't happen consistently enough to make a rule for them. However, for those cases there are a lot of alternate 'sans'-e forms for those, like ropeable / ropable. Perhaps a more interesting question and certainly one with a more complicated answer is how to know which words instead take ible forms.

Similar constructions include Wishing you a happy birthday Wishing you a merry Christmas Wishing you well To use *Wish you a happy weekend you need to add I to make the sentence grammatical. i.e. I wish you a happy weekend.

So, an example of correct use is: A group of us is/are going to the theatre this evening. For any of your examples, both is and are can be used. I think the difference between them is as you say: use is when you are referring to the group, and use are when you are referring to the members of a given group. This page on when to use 'group' as plural from Washington State University backs this up, saying: When the group is being considered as a whole, it can be treated as a single entity: 'the group was ready to go on stage.' But when the individuality of its members is being emphasized, 'group' is plural: 'the group were in disagreement about where to go for dinner.' To analyze your given examples, here are some notes: A sentence is a group of words that is followed by a period. Use this form if you're talking about the group itself. That is, a sentence is a group of words followed by a period. A sentence is a group of words that are followed by a period. This implies that 'This. Is. A. Sentence' is a sentence.

                "The issue isn't as definitive as you might think. Ultimately, it comes down to what interpretation of 'next' you consider to be correct. For example, the American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed) defines 'next' simply as Immediately following, as in time, order, or sequence Following this definition, 'next weekend' will always mean the weekend with the start date in closes proximity in time. If the phrase is used during a weekend, of course, you'd be referring to the weekend following the one you are currently experiencing. However, the issue gets more complicated if you look to other definitions. The Oxford American Dictionary has a specific definition for 'next' when used in the context of time: (of a day of the week) nearest (or the nearest but one) after the present : not this Wednesday, next Wednesday Here, we're given the choice: it can either mean the weekend with the closest start date, or the following one (as specified by the parenthetical addition or the nearest but one). This definition has come about mostly because of usage development. Many words and phrases in the english dictionary have meanings contrary to their technical definitions, and yet are still used commonly and considered valid. Thus, while technically 'next' implies immediate sequence, it is used in other ways (which dictionaries like the OAD have accommodated for validity), so it's really a matter of personal preference. For example, it is unlikely that I will even use the phrase 'next weekend' during the week, because some people might be confused as to what I am referring to. Instead, I will say 'this weekend,' unless it is currently the weekend, in which case I will say 'next weekend.'"

The former implies every cat on Earth doesn't like me; the latter, that some (contextually obvious) specific group of cats don't like me. ADDED In my opinion, yes, unmemorize that reference in your other question and memorize the following: use the definite article with a plural only to denote a known or stated subset of the class ('The elephants [in this zoo] are dangerous'); omit the article for the whole class ('Elephants [all of them] are dangerous'). Use an indefinite article with a singular to denote the whole class when you want to emphasize the singular nature ('A glass of wine is healthy, but two can lead to dissolution.') Use the definite article with a singular when referring to a specific instance or when you need, for some reason, to sound like Sir David Attenborough in a BBC nature documentary ('The elephant is a regal creature, reigning over his home, the savanna ...'). Of course, an indefinite article with a plural ('An elephants are dangerous') and omitting articles with the singular of a countable noun ('Elephant is dangerous') are both just wrong, wrong, wrong. Edit Two years later and I realize another rule: 'the' is used to mark adjectives that have been promoted to nouns. When Paul Revere said, 'The British are coming', he was referring to the British 10th Regiment of Foot, not to every subject of King George, so the 'the' was de rigeur under the above rule. However, when Quentin Crisp wrote, 'The British do not expect happiness,' he did mean every single Briton. The 'the' is only necessary to make it clear that the word 'British' is being used as a noun. With an ordinary noun, it would be different. 'Plumbers [all plumbers] do not expect happiness' but 'The plumbers [in London] do not expect happiness.' Compare Jacques Brel's lyric, 'The naked and the dead should hold each others' hands' with Dean Wormer's line, 'Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.' 'Naked' and 'dead' are nouns (or adjectives being used as nouns); 'fat', 'drunk', and 'stupid' are adjectives, which is why he uses 'is' instead of 'are': the subject of the verb is 'no way'."

                "'Why is this funny?' may be one of the hardest questions to answer. Humor is subjective, circumstantial, and, not infrequently, ineffable. Personally, I don't think I'd ever encountered a nun joke before this, as I didn't grow up in a community with many Catholics and nuns didn't really seem relevant to our lives. Thus, like OP, I would never have understood the joke by myself. The other answers show that an understanding of the joke requires some basic cultural assumptions - here, that nuns are secretly lewd (and sometimes, apparently, lesbian). When the one nun asks, 'Where's the soap?', the other takes this as a declarative comment about her current (apparently masturbatory) use of the soap: 'Wears [out] the soap.' The guilty nun then affirms that 'Yes, it does, rather.' Why do some people find this funny? Because they already have a history of finding sexualized nuns funny, and this joke triggers their comic affection for that idea. There are innumerable jokes that similarly necessitate some level of preconceived notion for their humor to be apparent. Let's look, for instance, at this 'dumb blonde' joke: The waiter asked the blonde if she would like her pizza cut into six pieces or twelve. 'Six, please,' she said. 'I could never eat twelve!' Why is this funny (to the extent that it is)? Because its audience has been programmed (probably from a young age) to find the idea that blondes are stupid funny. The joke itself doesn't much matter in its details - it just has to trigger that automatic comic response. Examples abound - jokes about how Jewish/Asian/[insert modifier here] men have small penises, jokes about how 'you might be a redneck if...', and on and on. Ultimately, they're contextual, and no amount of explaining the context will make the joke funny (even if it makes it decipherable)."

In addition, from the Math Forum once the size of an ellipse has been fixed then its exact shape is mathematically determined. In other words, the line forming the perimeter can be drawn in only ONE way. This is distinct from an oval where the perimeter has only to be a concave curve, and there are many possibilities.

Tradition gave Leod two sons, Tormod - progenitor of the Macleods of Harris and Dunvegan (Siol Tormoid); and Torquil - progenitor of the Macleods of Lewis (Siol Torcaill). In the 16th and early seventeenth centuries the chiefly line of the Clan Macleod of The Lewes was extinguished due to family infighting. This feuding directly led to the fall of the clan, and loss of its lands to the Clan Mackenzie. The modern line of chiefs of Clan Macleod of The Lewes are represented by the leading family of a cadet branch of the clan - the Macleods of Raasay.

Correct: Bill and Mary's car was a lemon, leading them to seek rescission of their contract under the state's lemon law.

To quote from that article... trope has to do with an agreed-upon narrative, an archetypal reading of a story or situation according to the simplest and most widely-held beliefs, a kind of narrative stereotype. Or, as the excellent site tvtropes puts it... tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations. I actually studied literature over 40 years ago, but I can't say I remember us using the word in the 'typical' dictionary sense as given by OED... A figure of speech which consists in the use of a word or phrase in a sense other than that which is proper to it; also, in casual use, a figure of speech; figurative language. So far as I'm concerned, if someone wants to use it like that, I'm not going to argue with them or their dictionaries. But most current usages are more in line with my first two definitions above. Here's how tvtropes knits the two definitions together... Merriam-Webster gives a definition of 'trope' as a 'figure of speech.' In storytelling, a trope is just that a conceptual figure of speech, a storytelling shorthand for a concept that the audience will recognize and understand instantly."

Weakened sensed of 'very great, severe' (e.g. terrific headache) appeared 1809; colloquial sense of 'excellent' began 1888. So terrific started out on the same lines as horrific, but then gained a positive colloquial sense in the late 1800s. The phenomenon in which a previously bad word takes on a good connotation is discussed here, in which it is called amelioration. Amelioration (which has occurred for terrific, wicked, luxury) is a type of semantic change. While it is unclear what precisely happened to terrific, there are a few ways in which this change can occur: Linguistic forces Psychological forces Sociocultural forces Cultural/encyclopedic forces You can read more about it here. It has been suggested (though there is little proof) that terrific became 'good' because of an association with the popular media via King Kong. Other than this theory, though, it is clear that terrific underwent some kind of semantic change between the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 1930 Popular Science was still using the term to mean something 'frightening', and by the 1940s it was used mostly to mean 'good'."

The word also comes up a lot in science-fiction wherever some made-up technical term pertaining to time (usually time travel) is required, e.g. temporal mechanics. In real science, the term is sometimes used as a complement to spatial (pertaining to space). Temporary is a much more common word. It means 'lasting for a limited time' and is the opposite of permanent. Politicians sometimes qualify their policies as a 'temporary measure' to give the impression that there are plans for them to be repealed in due course (which, of course, never happens, but that's a different matter).

Used literally at first in English; sense of 'elegant, cultured' is first recorded c.1500, that of 'behaving courteously' is 1762. Polite, both in its original literal usage and in its current usage, is more about superficial appearance. To be polite, one need only use polite words and manners. Nothing internal is necessary. The history of kind, on the other hand, is related to internal goodness: 'friendly,' from O.E. gecynde 'natural, native, innate,' originally 'with the feeling of relatives for each other,' from P.Gmc. gakundiz, from kunjan (see kin), with collective prefix ga- and abstract suffix -iz. Sense development from 'with natural feelings,' to 'well-disposed' (c.1300), 'benign, compassionate' (c.1300). Ultimately, politeness tells you little about a person's character; it may be sincere, or it may be highly calculated. Kindness, though, is directly related to a person's character, and is quite difficult to fake."

Here are a few examples of the evolution of the spelling of some Old English words. queen used to be spelled cwen (and mean 'young woman'). quick used to be spelled cwic (and mean alive). drink used to be spelled drinc. bishop used to be spelled biscop (closer to 'Episcopal'). ship used to be spelled scip. Of course there is no single cause to all these changes. And even summarising them in a small answer is a huge challenge. But there is an interesting section in the wikipedia article about the 'C' letter. Yet I'd like to add a few background considerations. After the Anglo Saxon conquest of Britain in the 5th century, texts (very few have actually come down to us) were all written in the Runic Alphabet, because that was the alphabet in use in Germany (it had actually been borrowed from the Etruscan who add taken it from the Greeks who... who... Proto-Canaanite/Egyptians). In other words the Latin alphabet introduced by the Roman occupation fell into complete oblivion. When Pope Gregory sent out Augustine to convert the famously 'non angli, sed angeli' heathens, the dominant writing system shifted back to the Latin alphabet. Within a few decades England quickly raised to the most culturally prominent country in Europe (its lavishly illuminated Bibles and other religious manuscripts can still be found in many European museums and libraries). But the language used for these masterpieces was still Latin. There are very few words of English in these texts. Then the Vikings raided the monasteries to plunder all their riches and in the process they killed a large proportion of scholars. As a result, when King lfred endeavoured to rekindle the light of English culture, he started writing texts in 'Old nglisc' instead of Latin. For this purpose he naturally used the Latin alphabet with however the addition of a few runic characters (among which the '' and the '' for the sound 'th'). The 'c' was used for the sound /k/, 'cw' for /kw/ (queen), 'ce' and 'ci' for [t] (child) and 'sc' for [] (ship). These conventions were inspired from Vulgar Latin. In Middle English (in the wake of the Norman invasion), under the influence of the French spelling system, English underwent a spelling reform which affected many words containing the letter 'c'."

                "Using 'me' (or indeed other object pronouns) like this generally considered to be grammatically incorrect, because a subject pronoun ('I') should be used as subject of the verb. In formal (and probably everyday middle-of-the-road) language, this misuse of object pronouns is to be avoided. You should use 'Adam and I', with 'I' after the 'and', because 'I and Adam' sounds awkward (and grandiose). But 'me' as a subject is relatively common in informal language. Certainly I remember using sentences like 'Me and Simon are going to the park' in the school playground, only to be rebuked by my teachers in the classroom. In the classroom we learn to say 'Simon and I are going to the park' instead, using a subject pronoun, because Simon and I are the subjects of the verb to go. If we have good teachers, we learn to check by removing the other person: 'Simon and I are going...' becomes 'I am going', which sounds ok, so we say it. This way, when the pronoun should correctly be an object pronoun, we get it right even when Simon is in the way: 'The dog attacked me' so 'The dog attacked Simon and me'. And we don't have to learn nasty words like accusative. If we didn't pay enough attention though, or had bad teachers, we'll think the rule is that you never say 'Simon and me' and always 'Simon and I'. So we start producing hyper-correct forms like 'The dog attacked Simon and I', where 'I' is a subject pronoun instead of the required object pronoun ('me'). Or 'Mr Smith give Simon and I the belt for bad grammar' (should be 'Simon and me'). And people who learnt this and in later life find some authority while avoiding dates with descriptivist grammarians might start hyper-correcting people who otherwise use their pronouns correctly (effectively? pragmatically?). This all gets scary pretty fast, and so we might instead fudge things by using 'myself' etc., which is also wrong, but less likely to draw ire: 'Myself and Simon are going drinking in the park', or 'the dog attacked Simon and myself'. Forms like these are common in colloquial speech in Glasgow, where I live, and not a million miles from the entirely correct 'I myself am going drinking', with 'myself' as an emphatic pronoun. But we can also take revenge on these ill-informed hyper-correct pedants and, to spite our expensive university educations, start dropping forms like 'Me and Adam have discovered a lot of weird things since we came to Japan' into our radio conversations. It's more fun than explaining to somebody that French has disjunctive pronouns and 1066 and all that so why can't English because 'Simon et moi allons au parc ce soir' is ok? It's more rootsy than opining that English speakers must have a pretty weak grip on grammatical case these days if Simon and Adam's getting in the way is enough to muck it up.... Maybe what we're really learning is that our American radio personality's gig researching weirdness in Japan is enough of an indicator of social prestige that he doesn't need the crutch of prescriptive grammar to get ahead, except of course when it came to writing the application to get the job in the first place. If they is a reasonably sophisticated user of language, perhaps with a penchant for swiping pragmatist linguists right, s/he can likely adapt xir pronouns to the situation, (un)consciously confident that good language is really all about communicative power... Or maybe instead we'll one day hear a radio programme regretfully imploring the grandchildren to invest in Grammarly after a later-life realisation that pronominal correction is a socio-political power play and hell, the history of English from the Anglo-Saxon swamp til now tells us that it's always more fun to wield power by proxy than receive hit like me, Adam and hyper-correct I did. Such digressions aside, I'm struggling slightly to think of a situation where saying 'Me and Adam' instead of 'Adam and I' without a change in word order or stress changes the meaning EXCEPT in terms of social signalling -- something I gather Japanese knows about. Maybe something like 'Sally saw Steven and I went home and had breakfast', versus 'Sally saw Steven and me went home and had breakfast'. But even here, putting a comma or pause in makes more of a difference: in 'Sally saw Steven and I, went home and had breakfast', Sally gets the food, whereas in 'Sally saw Steven, and me went home and had breakfast' the breakfast is likely me's comfort food. To summarise: in informal language it's quite frequent, potentially common, potentially natural, and doesn't really affect meaning. But please don't say 'Adam and me would be excellent choices for the post of Pronoun Safety Officer' in formal communication that matters."

                "I provided a long answer to the question 'Capitalisation in texts where the title is also a concept that is referred to within the text?' a while ago. Part of my answer to that question is directly relevant to this one. In the following quotation, The Boss is a nickname commonly used for the singer Bruce Springsteen. Sometimes what sounds natural can supersede what is technically correct from a syntactical point of view. For example: \u2714 Those are the Gucci shoes I was talking about. Here, we have a proper noun acting to modify a common noun. But while the next sentence follows the same syntactical rule, it doesn't look right: ? That is the The Boss ticket I was talking about. Even though the second article is not actually an article per se (it's part of a name), it's not possible to look at the duplication and think it's appropriate. If something is technically correct, but is still incredibly awkward, it's better to rephrase it. In this case, we could omit one or the other word (knowing the meaning would be understood anyway) or we could actually restructure the sentence so it's not awkward to start with: \u2714 That is the ticket to The Boss I was talking about. \u2714 That is the The Boss ticket I was talking about. \u2714 That is the The Boss ticket I was talking about. In the last two sentences, we know perfectly well which words should be capitalizedit's just that we're choosing to omit one or the other for the sake of comprehension. (And which we omit would be a matter of style or personal choice.)"

            "output": [
                "No, units generally do not need capitalization when spelled out. For SI units, the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures is the authority: Unit names are normally printed in roman (upright) type, and they are treated like ordinary nouns. In English, the names of units start with a lower-case letter (even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter), except at the beginning of a sentence or in capitalized material such as a title. In keeping with this rule, the correct spelling of the name of the unit with the symbol C is 'degree Celsius' (the unit degree begins with a lower-case d and the modifier Celsius begins with an upper-case C because it is a proper name). The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed., Sec.5.2 However, capitalization is used in the following cases: Symbols for SI units named after people, for example: 1 ampere, abbreviated as 1 A 1angstrom or 1angstrom, abbreviated as 1A Note that the names of the units themselves are lowercase. The symbol for litre or liter is l, but is often written as L to prevent it from looking like the digit 1. It is also sometimes rendered in lowercase cursive form for the same reason: The litre, and the symbol lower-case l, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV, 1879, 41). The alternative symbol, capital L, was adopted by the 16th CGPM (1979, Resolution 6; CR, 101 and Metrologia, 1980, 16, 56-57) in order to avoid the risk of confusion between the letter l (el) and the numeral 1 (one). The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed., Sec.4.1 Temperature degree units, e.g. degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit, abbreviated as C and F, as stated in the quote above. Note, however, that the kelvin follows the rule for units named after people: 1kelvin, abbreviated as 1K. Special non-SI units, such as the British thermal unit, abbreviated BTU or Btu, or the US gallon, for obvious reasons. The astronomical unit is abbreviated either as au or AU. The international unit is abbreviated IU. A byte is abbreviated as B; a bit is abbreviated as b. A decibel is abbreviated as dB. One unit where capitalization makes a huge difference is the calorie. A calorie (abbreviated cal) is the energy needed to heat one gram of water by 1C. This unit is used by physicists and chemists. A Calorie (abbreviated Cal or kcal) is actually a kilocalorie 1000 times the amount of energy of a calorie. This unit is used by dieticians and the general public when describing food. Naturally, at the beginning of a sentence, the usual rule that the first letter be capitalized overrides all of the above. For example, Watt for watt, a RISC chip delivers better performance than a CISC chip. Also note that capitalization is significant in the SI prefixes. For example, mW is a milliwatt, and MW is a megawatt."

Today, however, it does not form part of standard English and should not be used in formal contexts. The sentence then contains a double negative, but the double negative is sometimes used to give emphasis to a negative. The NOAD has the following notes, about the usage of double negatives: According to standard English grammar, a double negative used to express a single negative, such as I don't know nothing (rather than I don't know anything), is incorrect. The rules dictate that the two negative elements cancel each other out to give an affirmative statement, so that, logically, I don't know nothing means I know something. In practice, this sort of double negative is widespread in dialect and nonstandard usage and rarely causes confusion about the intended meaning. Double negatives are standard in other languages such as Spanish[, Italian] and Polish, and they have not always been unacceptable in English. They were normal in Old English and Middle English and did not come to be frowned upon until some time after the 16th century. The double negative can be used in speech or in written dialogue for emphasis or other rhetorical effects. Such constructions as has not gone unnoticed or not wholly unpersuasive may be useful for making a point through understatement, but the double negative should be used judiciously because it may cause confusion or annoy the reader."

When the first or last element in a phrasal adjective is part of a compound noun, it too needs to be hyphenated: post-cold-war norms, not post-cold war norms. Otherwise, as in that example, cold appears more closely related to post than to war. In your example, machine learning is the compound noun and related is the additional element in the adjective phrase, so Garner would endorse punctuating it as machine-learning-related. The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth edition (2003) takes essentially the same position as Garner: 5.92 Phrasal adjectives. A phrasal adjective (also called a compound modifier) is a phrase that functions as a unit to modify a noun. A phrasal adjective follows these basic rules: ... (2) If a compound noun is an element of a phrasal adjective, the entire compound noun must be hyphenated to clarify the relationship among the words {video-game-magazine dispute} {college-football-halftime controversy}. Words Into Type, third edition (1974) emphasizes the practical goal to be achieved by hyphenating (or not hyphenating): Phrases used as attributive adjectives usually require hyphenation to make clear their relation to the noun they modify. [Examples:] the how-to-study area; a life-and-death struggle If such a phrase modifier is hyphenated at all, it should be hyphenated throughout; but no hyphen should be used between the modifier and the noun. Wrong: low milk-and-cream yielding dam Right: low milk-and-cream-yielding dam Wrong: pay-as-you-go-plan Right: pay-as-you-go plan If there is scarcely any possibility of misreading, hyphens need not be used. [Examples:] a story and a half house; a thirty percent increase; yellow pine timber belt All of these (U.S.) style guides agree that when ambiguity as to what is modifying what might ensue from an unpunctuated adjective phrase, it is better to hyphenate the elements of the phrase than to leave the words open. But the goal is greater clarityand if the hyphens don't clarify anything, they have no business being there. Thus far, my answer has focused on the 'machine-learning-related certification' example in your question. Compound modifiers that incorporate proper nouns of two words or more (such as 'Mount Everestbased climbing expedition') follow a different rule in these style guides: leaving the proper name open, and connecting the compound noun to the adjective with an en-dash instead of a hyphen. I won't go back into the reference works to quote the specific guidelines from each book, but they recommend the approach I have just outlined in this paragraph."

Much of the modern range of meanings was present in Old English. Meaning 'property which distinguishes living from non-living matter' is from 1560s. Sense of 'vitality, energy' is from 1580s. Extended 1703 to 'term of duration (of inanimate objects).' etymonline.com emphasis added Language is my life. Meaning: Language is my conscious rationale to work another day, and the deepest joy of my heart."

According to NCLB, each year, fifth graders must do better in the standardized test than the previous year's fifth graders. Schools that fail to achieve this for two or more consecutive years were required to take certain measures in order to 'improve the school'. As you can see, NCLB was an act centered around standardized testing. Students'and by extension their schools'performance was measured and scrutinized by the test scores. A common criticism of standardized testing is that it leads teachers to focus on test performance, instead of aiming to help students achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum. Chomsky talks about how he wasn't able to successfully carry out experiments in the chemistry lab, and yet scored an A by filling out a paper with the results of the experiments, which were quite obvious. He mentions that the this test-centered approach to education had been going on for about 10 years with 'no reported progress', since, he believes, 'serious education' is different and does not focus on standardized test scores. When Chomsky mentions that this failing approach to education has a name, 'No Child Left Behind', the audience laughs and cheers in order to express their agreement with his ridicule and criticism of this act. The reason they laugh is that he refers to his chemistry lab experience as 'No Child Left Behind', even though it predates the passing of the unpopular act by several years."

To illustrate, note how the meaning shifts in the following sentences: I bought a cheap laptop. I bought a laptop for a cheap price. The 'low quality' connotation is minimized when 'cheap' becomes the comparative adjective, 'cheaper'. It imparts some context that it is probably the price of two items you are comparing.

Lets say we have 3 scenarios: A person who hates all followers of a specific religion, no matter what their background is, but otherwise likes people of all skin colors and origin countries who are not followers of a specific religion. A person who hates all people with a specific skin color, no matter what their background is, but otherwise likes followers of all religions and origin countries who do not have a specific skin color. A person who hates all people from a specific country, no matter what their background is, but otherwise likes followers of all religions and all skin colors who are not from a specific country. 'Hates' in this context means believing they are worthless, being prejudiced against them, generally discriminating against them, bad behaviour against them, and disliking them. 'likes' just means the opposite of my explanation above. So, based on this definition of the word racist: The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others. Discrimination or prejudice based on race. Would you use the word racist to describe the person in all of the 3 examples I gave? Or are there better fitting words for specific forms of discrimination? Particularly for the first scenario (religion specific racism). I am looking for a better word to describe such a person. Religion is independent from race, and I am not sure if only country of origin is enough to relate to a specific race so that the word racist could fit here. Skin color is more obvious, but there could also be some discussion if a specific skin color already suffices to assign something to a specific race.

I've looked briefly at various websites, most of whom mention the Latin origin, but I was interested in seeing whether there might be a different route anyone knew of.",
            "output": [
                "No, there is no link. There are three main aspects to this, and all three of them agree fairly conclusively that there is precious little possibility that Greek has anything to do with medicine through the proverb 'laughter is the best medicine': there's the well-established Latin origin of the word medicine, the Greek verb itself, and the English proverb. The Latin origin As Josh's answer states, it is well-established that the word medicine comes to us through French from Latin, based ultimately on the verb medeor, which in Latin means only 'heal, cure, remedy, amend, correct, relieve'. Further back, that verb comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *med-, which originally meant 'measure, limit, consider, weight out, etc.'. Its meaning represents a semantic shift in that root which was specific to the Italic languages, however. The Greek cognates to the Latin verb (active and middle ), thus mean, respectively, 'protect, rule over' (representing a semantic shift specific to Greek) and 'provide for, think on, be mindful of, bethink one of'. Of the Latin verb, de Vaan says: The meaning of medeor is based on a semantic shift from 'measure' to 'distribute a cure, heal'. For a PIE stative verb (as assumed by LIV) or a frequentative, the e-grade in med- would be surprising. If the intermediate phase was 'to judge' (cf. meditor), medeor and its e-grade may have been grafted on the noun *medo(s)- 'judgement, law' (> modus) seen in U[mbrian] mers, mers 'law'. We can then regard it as a stative verb *med-e- 'to be a judge' > 'to be a healer, to heal' which was formed within Italic. The three essential things to note here are: that this sense of the base verb and its form were formed within the Italic branch of Indo-European languages; that the same root is attested in Greek with a different meaningand also a different form to the verb ; that the phonemic/phonetic form of the word 'medicine' in English, /md(i)sn/, is somewhat coincidental and bears no relation to its Latin forebearer. Medicus, the immediate ancestor, would be /medikus/ with a /k/ sound, like medical rather than medicine. The change from /k/ to /s/ did not happen until some time in Vulgar Latin, around a thousand years after the Iliad was en vogue. And of course the derivational base of Latin medicus is a verb that doesn't have any consonant there at all: the consonant is part of the adjectivising suffix, not the root. So the only thing left in common with the English word medicine is the stem med-. The Greek verb The verb form you're asking about here, , does not really mean 'laugh or smile' as such, but rather 'he/she/it smiled': it is the third person singular aorist form of the verb 'smile'. Moreover, it's an extended variant of that form: the base form is , without the ephelcystic nu, which gets rid of the n in medicine. Get rid of the further conditioning that this in an inflected aorist form (which very rarely form the basis for creating nouns), and you also lose the /s/, since that is the aorist marker. You then, again, have only a verbal root in common, this time meid-. Of course, that immediately raises the problem that meid- and med- are not the same thing: both English and Greek (and Latin, for that matter) have both, and they are not interchangeable. Greek words with -ei- do not normally end up yielding English // (that is, a short 'eh' sound). Even if that weren't enough to reject the theory, however, there is the fact that the Greek verb also has quite a satisfactory etymology: it is one of several extensions to the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)meih2-, whose base meaning is quite simply 'smile, be glad, laugh, be mirthful'. The extension that has survived in Greek here has a *-d-, while others have an *-r- or an *-l-. The reason the Greek verb begins with an m is quite simply that initial *sm- regularly loses its *s; the same happens with *sn-, which becomes just *n-.1 The same root is also behind the Latin adjective mirus (with the *-r- extension) and its derivatives (including words like miracle and admire): Latin underwent the same simplification of the initial cluster as Greek did. (The meaning of mirus 'wonderful, marvellous, amazing' represents another semantic shift that only happened within the Italic languages, or perhaps just within Latin itself.) In contrast, the Germanic languages were quite happy to keep *sm- unchanged, and the *smeih2- root also shows up as verbs here, indeed with both *-r- and *-l- extensions. The modern English forms of those verbs are smirk and smile. So with all that, the only part of medicine and that ends up being actually comparable is the m and the d. Not much, especially when you consider that both the proposed ancestors hereviz., Latin medeor and Greek have cognates in the opposite language that don't fit the form. The English proverb Finally, there is the question of the proverb that 'laughter is the best medicine'. While I don't think anyone knows for sure how old that particular turn of phrase is, it seems unlikely that it is as old as the Iliad. Proverbs 17:22 states that: A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. which is rather close to being the same sentiment. But it still seems fairly far-fetched as links goespecially when you consider that, as far as I can figure out, the classical Greek translation of that particular place used an entirely different word (my emphasis): , . The verb used for being cheerful here is 'cheer, make glad, be merry'; and the word loosely translatable as 'medicine' is , which literally means 'cause to be in a good condition'. So the Greek version really says,'A cheerful heart makes you in good condition', which is a fair distance from 'laughter is the best medicine'. Notes: If we're being precise, the initial s in this root is a so-called s-mobile, which means that even in Proto-Indo-European itself there seems to have been some vacillation between whether it was there or not. It showed up in some dialects/forms/cases/contexts, but not in others. That isn't particularly important in this case, though, since we're mostly dealing with two languages where it would have been lost anyway. There is at least some indirect evidence that both Greek and Latin did have the *s in this root originally: If it is correct that the word cosmis on the Duenos inscription is the same word, with the same meaning, as Classical Latin comis 'kind, gracious, affable, elegant', and that it represents an earlier *kom-smi- 'who has a smile', then the Early Latin form shows there was an original s there. If the Epic Greek form is an actual, historically justifiable form (rather than just a spurious variant to make it fit the metre by doubling the consonant), then it almost certainly represents *filo-hmeidas from earlier *filo-smeid-as, with the (in the compound not) initial *s."
