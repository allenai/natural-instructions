    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that contradict each other. Your job is to alter sentence 2 so that the pair agree with each other. Generated sentences must be short, with less than 15 words. New information can be introduced. Avoid using pronouns to confuse the subject of the sentence.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sentence 1: Jon saw his friend Tom coming out of the grocery store with a bag of fruit. Sentence 2: Tom had not been in the store.",
            "output": "Tom had gone inside the store and now has fruit.",
            "explanation": "Tom must have been inside the store to come out, and have fruit, so the altered sentence aggrees with sentence 1."
        },
        {
            "input": "Sentence 1: The girl transferred all the flowers from the boquet to a vase. Sentence 2: The girl took flowers from the vase to make a boquet.",
            "output": "The vase was big enough to hold all the flowers.",
            "explanation": "Since all the flowers are transferred, the vase must be of sufficient size, so the given sentence correctly aggrees with sentence 1."

            "input": "Sentence 1: Joyce likes to eat fruit salad with honey. Sentence 2: Joyce hates healthy eating.",

            "explanation": "The given sentence aggrees with sentence 1, so it's a correct answer."

            "output": "People in downtown San Francisco were unable to stand.",
            "explanation": "If the earthquake is of low magnitude, it is not necessary that it should cause people to fall, so this sentence doesn't necessarily aggree with sentence 1."

            "explanation": "If Anna ate at a picnic, she might have not been very hungry soon after it. There's no information about her eating at the picnic, so the sentence doesn't necessarily aggree with sentence 1."
