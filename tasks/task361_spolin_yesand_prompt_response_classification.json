    "Definition": "Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \"yes\" if response is \"yes, and\" type. Otherwise classify it as \"no\". \"Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\"Yes\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"Yes, and\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \"Yes, and\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'. ",

            "explanation": "This is correct answer because response is in support with the prompt and extends the context from prompt."

            "explanation": "The response clearly agrees with the prompt and continues the conversation in the same direction. Therefore the answer \"yes\" is correct."
