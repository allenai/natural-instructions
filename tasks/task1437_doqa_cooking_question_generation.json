Lipids are hydrophobic and will prevent further hydration of the glutenin.Using a lower-protein flour will also help. If you're not already using cake flour, the reason it's called cake flour is because of the lower protein content.That being said, have you actually tried leaving the batter coarse? Just because the batter is lumpy does not mean that the cake will have big lumps. The entire mixture is wet, so unless you leave huge lumps of dry flour in the batter, you won't end up with a lumpy cake. There's a difference between don't overmix and don't mix - you're supposed to mix enough to incorporate, just don't try homogenize it. <sep> Q: How can I avoid lumps in the cake? A: have you actually tried leaving the batter coarse? Just because the batter is lumpy does not mean that the cake will have big lumps Q: No, I haven't. I'll try that next.

This gives the benefit of keeping the frozen blueberries from sticking together without needing lots of freezer space to do a quick freeze individually on a sheet pan. Then bag in a freezer bag and freeze.Note that whenever you freeze fruit, the liquid will burst the cell walls as it thaws, causing the resulting berry to be mushier. In my experience, frozen blueberries aren't good for eating alone. To bake with blueberries, thaw them by placing them in a mesh sieve or collander and running water over them until the water is clear off the bottom (no pigmentation from the skins, which may color your baked goods) and the berries are thawed. Dry the skins before using in baking.Using these techniques I have not once had any of the 30 pounds of blueberries I froze this summer burst in the freezer and have successfully made many blueberry baked goods from the results.  <sep>  Q: what's a good technique for freezing blueberries?

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

Therefor, refreezing is no big deal. I recently answered another question about freezing and refreezing, and how it is basically a myth that it renders the refrozen product inedible. Any time you freeze you know that you are not going to get 'exactly' the same product when you thaw it, and the same goes with refreezing, there is always a 'slight' degredation of the product with each successive freeze (do you like my liberal usage of quotes?)

In many cookies, the flavors will also mature and improve, especially with cocoa in the recipe.In many recipes, the cooling from refrigeration is itself part of the point--doughs may be easier to roll and cut when they are cool due to chilling of the fat. Most dietary fats are waxy, which means they don't have a single set freezing/melting point, but rather get more viscous or eventually firmer then hard as temperature drops.For example, linzer cookie dough is very frangible, and the chilling and hydration make rolling and cutting much easier.Generally, most of this affect is going to happen in the first 8 hours or so.

(The stems on baby spinach are tender enough to eat, especially when blending, so you can use everything in your bags.)In any case, smoothies are really forgiving - not only do you not need a lot of precision, but you can just add and blend until the color and flavor look how you want!  <sep>  Q: How much is a bunch of spinach? A: A bunch of spinach usually weighs something like 250-500 grams ",

This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

Doing it in the oven won't be any faster or less boring than steaming it - it may even be slower, since heat transfer from steam is pretty efficient. 45 minutes at 120Â°C would probably leave it undercooked, and if you cook at a higher temperature, you'll be missing the point - steaming for a long time lets it cook slowly and more evenly. You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a \"normal\" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding. Then you can increase the temperature of the oven, perhaps to 150-175Â°C, without overheating the pudding. But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired.

Use a blender or immersion blender. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the cod liver oil. It will emulsify - the oil will disperse into ultra-fine droplets in the water, and presumably the taste will be both diluted and somewhat hidden by being locked up in little droplets. If this doesn't work, you just need more lecithin, so dissolve a bit more in another 1/4 cup of water and drizzle the whole thing back in to the blender.Naturally you'll want to take 50% more, since the oil is now only 2/3 of the volume.Those other ingredients are for flavor and anti-oxidation, not needed for the basic thing you are trying to accomplish.  <sep>  Q: How can I emulsify cod liver oil, or otherwise mask its taste?

It is designed to produce a consistent one for taste testing, so that no tea manufacturer can claim that his tea wasn't made \"properly\".It's title is \"Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests\"As for the actual tea making, yes, leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea. The concentration of caffeine (along with flavour molecules and everything else) will slowly trend towards an equal concentration in the leaf and in the water. The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway.

Unless you're whipping a lot of air into the batter, the cakes will barely rise, and you will end up with 'cookies'.I would add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and see if that helps.As for the temperature of your oven, I wouldn't go so far as to halve the temperature and double the time.

There's a bit of variation exactly how, but the effect is that the entire top can lift up, so that it can press down flat on whatever you stick in there.

If your sandwich is much smaller than the waffle iron, you can put it in the front part (as far from the hinge as possible), and it won't matter too much, but if it takes up a decent fraction of the area, it'll be squeezed pretty tight at the back compared to the front. This will probably make it cook unevenly, and depending on what you've got in there, might squeeze things out.Some panini presses also have better temperature controls than waffle irons, but that's probably not as much of a concern.So I'd give it a shot and see how it works, plan on possibly flipping your sandwich around halfway through, and don't be too upset if it's not pretty!(rfusca's comment above is also good - if you're able to take off the hinge, you'd avoid the whole problem.)  <sep>  Q: Can I use a waffle iron as a Panini press?

Apart from the notion that a chile is the pepper, which is the main ingredient, and chili is the dish, I don't like to define it too carefully (of course, New Mexicans think the dish is chile too, but what they have is different from Texas chili, even when they use red chiles). I think chili is a stew, though. Most stew isn't chili, but all chili is stew. And I believe that for most people to accept what you're making as chili, it would have to include a significant dose of dried red chile powder.So if you can accept the validity of white chili at all, and what you're making has almost all green chiles and very little red chile, then I'd say you're making a white chili.

It doesn't kill them, it just puts them in 'stasis'. The expiration date is given based on the meat only being refrigerated. If you intend to store the meat past its expiration date, best practice is to freeze the meat ASAP, and to use it within 24 hours of defrosting.The main hazard is in that defrosting. At no point should the chicken (any part thereof) be at room temperature for more than 2 hours. The safest method is to defrost the meat slowly in the fridge. You can also defrost it under cold running water, providing you keep it under the 2 hour mark.Of course, you can also cook the meat straight from frozen. There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this for small cuts like chicken breasts. Slicing and cooking a partially defrosted chicken breast is perfectly safe, especially as it often easier to make really thin strips with semi-solid meat. You just have to be extra careful that the meat is at a safe temperature (170Â°F/75Â°C).  <sep>  Q: Why is expired frozen chicken safe to eat?

The lack of flavour also says no, and I doubt reducing it would make much difference. You could use the water to make broth or stock, if you have bones/vegetables to hand.What's more likely to have happened is that condensation dripped into the water. This will always happen unless you take steps to prevent it, as the chicken is cooler than the steam, causing water to condense on the surface (more obvious with steaming green veg). This water dripping would carry small amounts of protein (e.g. myoglobin from dark meat) into the water, and it doesn't take much of many proteins to make water cloudy (this is why milk is white, or a few drops of milk make water cloudy).

I often substitute simply because, while I might have the intended cheese on hand, there may be some that I need to use sooner than others depending on how long I've had them or how long they've been open. With mild cheeses, you don't have to worry about the flavor profile so much - it's more the melting. And the cheeses I mentioned melt well - just like Mozzarella or Provolone.And to let you know, the reason I tried the other cheeses: I asked in a Mexican restaurant what kind of cheese they used and was told that it was \"like American Mozzarella\". So, I decided to experiment.All said and done, all of these cheeses have a mild flavor and work in many dishes, regardless of the ethnicity.

If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did.

I am particularly fond of brown basmati rice, which has more flavor than white basmati, but it takes longer to cook and will go rancid after 6 months. If basmati is not available, any long-grain rice will suffice; short-grain rice tends to be too sticky. As for technique, rinse the rice until the rinse-water runs clear. For every cup of rice, use 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp salt. Bring the water to a boil; add the rice and salt and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook covered until the liquid has been absorbed and the texture of the rice is tender.For additions to the rice, you have LOADS of options. You can add a pinch of saffron to the water for a vibrant yellow color and distinctive floral aroma (if you just want color, add 1/2 tsp ground turmeric). You can add chunks of peeled ginger, cracked peppercorns, whole peeled garlic cloves, whole cardamom pods, whole cloves, whole bay leaves, whole kaffir lime leaves, and/or whole stick cinnamon -- amounts and combinations are entirely up to your taste (just remember to remove any bay leaves before serving; remove the others or not as you like, but bay is inedible).

Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling?

Using a medium or coarse salt and erring on the less salty side, you can find the right proportion to suit your taste. Season before forming or after.

This is why when pan-frying a steak, you know it's close to medium rare once you see the juices start to come through the top. The fat in burgers does the same thing, it moves away from the heat source, and back into the rest of the meat. That's just what happens when meat cooks and constricts. Many fast food joints use a double grill (you pull an inverted flat top down on top of the burger on the flat top). Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process. As the patty is cooking from the top and bottom and sides at once, but with a more gentle heat, the fat (and some juices) come out instead of going to hide on the other side of the patty that isn't on a heat source.  <sep>  Q: How does adding water to the pan help the burger become better ?

The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying? A: Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: Why is removing moisture from onion important, for texture? A: helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster  Q: So, timing - Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying itself rather than adding it the last? A: Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring ",

However, if you are just looking at it as a simple binary system with water as the solvent and various sugars as solutes, one at a time, then there is a very simple answer (not necessarily useful alone).For dilute solutions, freezing point depression is primarily driven by the solvent and not so much the solute, and the relationship is linear. For sugars, Freezing Point Depression (Â°C) = 1.86 * MM is mass/molecular-mass of whichever sugar you use in 1000ml of water. For your example of 10g of sucrose in 100ml water, M is 0.29 and your freezing point is minus 0.5C.For disaccharides like sucrose and lactose, they have identical molecular mass of 342. For simple sugars like glucose and fructose (dextrose is just d-glucose), it is 180. For inverted syrup, you have a mixture. For polyalcohols, you can look up their masses easily.I would still advise against using this sort of tool alone for icecream making.Separately, sweetness is less about just dry mass but molar concentration, which is why inverted syrup is sweeter than sucrose, 1 unit of sucrose in the same amount of water is less sweet than if it was broken into their constituent mono-saccharide glucose and fructose; instead of 1 unit of sucrose, you have 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose, double the concentration.  <sep>  Q: what impact does a sugar have on ice cream?

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer.

My experience, taken from memory, follows:Turkish coffee goes through a sequence of mouth feels, from completely clear, to grainy, almost muddy, with coffee grounds. This also affects the flavour of the coffee. At the beginning, it is much like a strong filter brew, but tends to get bitter towards the end of the cup, which is also, in part, why it is traditionally served in very small cups. In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot.

It is possible that your bread may become edible texture wise if you cut the amount of total sugar by half and then experiment for a few dozens of batches with different classes of sugar to get a workable texture. But I doubt that it will be worth it. When you bake, don't think of sugar as a sweetener. Baking recipes are always calculated such that the sugar amount is right for the correct texture, not for sweetness. If you want sweet bread, use an existing recipe for a brioche style bread, which is somewhat sweetened. Or if you want it extra sweet, use a recipe for very sweet bread, but be prepared for it to handle a bit weirdly during kneading and to end up with a cakelike texture.

Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough.

So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

It turned out this one was a very simple pan sauce built with brandy and beef stock as a deglazing liquid which was allowed to reduce by about 2/3 and then it was finished with a hint of cream.The fond came from a steak cooked in butter so there was probably a little browned butter in there as well.At this point I think the reduced brandy is a big contributor to the flavor I was identifying as butterscotch.

For something like a beef or pork roast, the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast. For chicken or turkey, it will often be where the leg joins the body. You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading.Now, because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature, the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is. In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained. To err on the side of food safety, keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature. With a little experience, you'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts, and remove it from the oven earlier.The bottom line however, is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature.  <sep>  Q: In what stage should the temperature of meat be taken?

Milk will eagerly do that on its own, and starchy water will too, so the combination has to be cooked on very low heat to avoid making a huge mess. (I think this is why the original recipe starts with water: less time with potential for boiling over, and more stable temperature when you add the milk.) You'll also probably want to be more careful about stirring the first time; if the heat is a little higher than you realize, you will start accumulating a layer on the bottom of the pan.If you want them to cook faster and have less potential boiling over to worry about, you can always presoak in milk beforehand.
