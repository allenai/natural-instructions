    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given triplets. Each triplet is in the form of [subject, predicate, object]. Your task is to generate proper sentence that utilizes these triples. The objective is to construct a sentence that (a) captures the facts specified in the triples and (b) is a well-formed sentence easily understandable by a human. All triple values need not be used directly in the sentence as long as the facts are adequately captured."

            "output": "The team whose nickname is red raiders is located in the orange city, iowa",
            "explanation": "This sentence uses the triplets by correctly using the (subject, predicate, object) semantics for both the triplets provided. Since college teams are popularly associated with nicknames, some information in the generated sentence can be inferred. In this case, Northwestern College was replaced with the team automatically."

            "input": "[['University of Mississippi', 'NEW_CONFERENCE', 'SELC']]",
            "output": "University of mississippi was in the selc new conference.",
            "explanation": "This sentence logically follows from the triplet provided. The subject (University of Mississippi) interacts with the object (SELC) using the predicate (NEW_CONFERENCE). The statement is grammatically correct and logically follows from the triplet."

            "output": "The title of season 3 episode 12 is \"Hear the Birds.\"",
            "explanation": "This sentence is based on the subject (hear the birds) associated with being a part of the object (12) via the predicate (season_3_ep_#). This sentence is a good example since it is easily interpretable by a human and it is likely that this sentence would be generated by a human given access to just the triplet."

    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "[['Graham Edwards', 'PROVINCE', 'North Metropolitan']]",
            "output": "Province North Metropolitan Province is represented by the Graham.",
            "explanation": "This sentence is a bad example since even though it utilizes the triplets, it does not form a coherent statement correctly. The subject (Graham Edwards) appears as the object in this statement. The correct output could be Graham Edwards is in the North Metropolitan Province."

        {
            "input": "[['Li Qiaoxian (CHN)', 'PRELIMINARY_RANK', '6']]",
            "output": "Li Qiaoxian has 6 ranks in China.",

            "output": "Mrs. Olivia McKoy born 2006 participated in the Olympics",
            "explanation": "This sentence is a negative example since the generated sentence misappropriates the facts that are represented by the triplet. For example, addressing Olivia as 'Mrs' is factually incorrect assuming that she is born is 2006, which makes her a minor. Also, intuitively, 2006 was likely associated with the competition and not w.r.t. Olivia."
