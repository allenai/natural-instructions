        "In this task you will be given a process, and a question. The process contains a sequence of steps that happen in order. The question asks about the effect of a certain event on another event. If the first event has a positive effect on the second event, answer with \"for\", if it has a negative effect, answer with \"against\". If there's no causal relationship between the two, answer with \"none\"."
