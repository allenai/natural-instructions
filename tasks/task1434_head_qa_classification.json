Point out the TRUE answer: \n Options:  <0> Among the measures to be taken when sepsis is suspected, antibiotic therapy is administered in the 1st hour of arrival, although this attitude has not been correlated with a decrease in mortality. <1> The early administration of IV fluids is essential to maintain adequate tissue perfusion, the goal being to maintain an average blood pressure> 65 mmHg. <2> Among the complementary tests that are received we observed a lactate> 5.6 mmol / L; it must be taken into account but as long as hemodynamic stability is maintained we should not worry. <3> In fact, the diagnosis of sepsis is not correct since the absence of fever rules out it. <4> The patient presents hypotension despite intensive administration of intravenous fluid therapy; It is time to administer vasoactive drugs, with isoproterenol being the choice.",
