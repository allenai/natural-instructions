        "Given a list of steps and an additional step, determine where the step fits into the original list of steps. A correct answer, correctly places the given step into the set of steps so that it creates a new plausible set of steps. Output must be formatted as 'After step n', where n is the step number after which the given additional step is to be inserted."

            "explanation": "The correct answer is 'After step 3'. The given step is 'Heat radiates from Earth to Space'. Step 3 introduces a new concept of generated heat. Step 4 mentions that the heat is trapped into the atmosphere. In order for the heat to get to the atmosphere, the heat must radiate from Earth to space. Therefore, the correct answer is 'After step 3.'"
