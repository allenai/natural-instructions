    "Definition": "In this task, you will be given sentences in which you have to list the tokens that mention names of the body cells. A cell is a mass of cytoplasm that is bound externally by a cell membrane. Usually microscopic in size, cells are the smallest structural units of living matter and compose all living things. You should list the tokens in the same order that they appear in the text. If no target entities are mentioned, just output \"not found\".",
