The country went from second richest in Latin America to second poorest (beating out Haiti) during Castro's half century dictatorship.  Even his early reforms in health care and education have largely run out of money and deteriorated drastically.  But the biggest three things Fidel did really badly for the average Cuban were breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Mind you, Cassie, not all Cubans suffered.  Fidel, for example, took them for some $900 million dollars, 20 mansions around the Caribbean and an 88 foot luxury yacht to die for.

Local GOP leaders denied the charges.\n\nIn the suburb of Troutdale, an Iranian refugee found his home painted with racist graffiti and death threats. And in Gresham, another eastern suburb, prosecutors charged a man with a hate crime after police said he chased down a black teenager with his car after a fight and struck him, killing him.\n\nFor years, Portland was the home base for Volksfront, a now-defunct white separatist organization founded in 1994, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.\"\n\nWOW!",

Places like El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala were in the middle of vicious civll wars and genocides, driven by American-backed forces. 80,000 people were killed in ES; 80,000 in two wars in Nicaragua; in Guatemala, a genocide against the native population killed more than 200,000.

You should have used some other proportional, non-lethal, method.

Most animals that mate for life actually share all the same roles - they build their home together, feed and protect and hunt in turns.  So no gender division.  Women and men are equally equipped and desire all the same roles too and that is not a coincidence.  If God did not want women to be priests, he could have made them incapable of holding a cup or learning the expertise required or made them unable to give powerful homilies - yet God did not do this.  Scripture does not demand men and women have different roles either.  There are some animals that start off male and age into the opposite sex.  Chimps which are our closest biological relative have breeds that are pure matriarchy and some that are not. \n\nTony is sexist & misogynistic but if you pretend sexual discrimination isn't hate, even though you would not want a sacrament stripped from you because you are a man, then of course there is no misogyny-just denial of truth.",

If your business future is threatened because of the proposed tax \"reforms\" then you're likely not as intrepid and tough-minded as you'd like to think--and likely, like others to think.  Suck it up and get on with profit-making.

My inside sources tell me UAA doesn't work hard in practice , which explains why they can't handle it when the going gets tough.  Bemidji's goalie gave away Friday's game . Saturday they looked terrible yet still won.   Most people have limited entertainment dollars . The best bang for the buck is clearly the Aces .

This is not the same as saying that in general, homosexuals are more likely to be child abusers.\nIt seems to me that for homosexuals, becoming  a Catholic priest opens up opportunities to encounter teenage boys or before this scandal, did in the recent past, hardly a calling from God and thus justifying the ban.\nAny priest with homosexual inclinations who has remained celibate and not communicated his sexual preferences to all and sundry need not feel insulted in the slightest. He is to be admired for carrying his cross in silence.",

This means they will only dissolve in oil and not water. That is why weed smoke \u2013 while you may not like the smell \u2013 is not very \u201csticky\u201d.

So why would anyone take what he says on any given day seriously? \n\nAs you say, many states are just ignoring him.   Much of the world has too.  Just smile and carry on with your normal business.  \n\nFact is, Trump is much less dangerous than Trudeau, who plays the PR game well but whose policies and practices are very damaging to the country.

But I came to understand that wouldn't allow a city employee to call out dumb behavior by government, without their getting fired.\n\nI do have some questions going forward, regarding just what is civil and what is not. I recognize bullying when I see it, as it strives to humiliate a fellow human. But if I call someone a nincompoop for tricking my country into a war, is that civil?  How do I criticize dangerous behavior without going too far? Maybe a little more guidance as to what is considered civil would help. While civility is essential, so is honesty and clear language. Sometimes civility is just impossible. Would Michael Moore's movie,  \"Where to Invade Next\", be seen as civil?\nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

When your enemy has a gun pointed at your head you can either fight back or let them kill you. With my enemy, Republicans, I'd rather fight back. Hence the rationale behind my comment. Republicans now routinely ignore the old-fashioned adherence to Marquess of Queensberry rules of engagement - for them it's now party first, country be d*mned.

So I'm not sure why these articles seem to keep suggesting that people are not valuing the Arts degree.  Obviously many students still want it.  I got my Computer science degree MANY years ago and today I try to help others get into it.  And believe me, it is a lot harder to convince them to do comp sci than Arts or humanities related.  Incidentally, the USA still believes much in Liberal Arts.  Their degrees allow for much more room to take none core arts/humanities electives and I find American companies much more willing to hire Liberal Arts-type students wanting a more rounded individual (that's just my perception, maybe not reality).

Rebel is not a conservative site, it is a hate site and as a small c conservative I am glad they are losing big time.  In fact sites like the Rebel help not hinder the Liberals as most moderate sensible conservatives want nothing to do with extremism like this while their base loves it and thus the more the Tories play footsie with the Rebel the more marginalized they will be.  It is time for reasonable conservatives to tell the Rebel, they are a hate site, not a conservative one.",

The university is cutting programs that serve Alaskans and the mission of higher education and the cuts are starting to affect our ability to do our jobs.

Imagine the company pays $3 for their widget (after all discounts and rebates are accounted for) and tries to make a profit by reselling it at $2.50.  If anyone thinks they can make a profit this way, don't go into business.  Companies survive by selling their product a prices higher than their net cost.  The difference must also pay for overhead, salaries, insurance, etc. etc.  So if the profit margin is a couple of percent before measure 97, the company must raise prices or go out of business (assuming it can't fire people to reduce cost).\n\nI suspect that Mr. McKinney's company is not subject to the tax so of course he wants his competition to face it.",

I no longer wish to be called white, cracker, caucasian, or racist. I am a light skinned, person of the female persuasion. How STUPID does that sound?  I am a human being. Why can't that be enough? The name of the restaurant signifies nothing more than a seasoning, and food from a specific era, but it is a catchy title. Should we all boycott McDonald's because the name sounds Scottish but they don't serve Scottish food? How about Subway, their food has nothing to do with underground transportation. Does the name Texas Roadhouse offend Texans? See where I'm going with this. It is just too much! If the name bugs you that much, don't eat there, and stay out of it. The owner doesn't want to force their beliefs on you or erase your culture. They just want to feed you. How about we find something important to get upset over?",
