        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

Clearly there is intense anguish on the side of the children who suffer gender dysphoria.  There is anguish from the parents who want to do the right thing but aren't really sure what the right thing is.  There are the activists who clearly have an agenda (and not necessarily for the best interest of the kid) .  There are medical professionals such as Dr. Zucker who, it seems, really appeared to be trying to do the right thing for the child.\n\nMy take away is that it is complicated.  But based on seeing the BBC special, it seemed like the approach that Dr. Zucker and colleagues were taking to talk with the child and get to to know the child seemed to be the best approach.  And, if in the end, gender transition is what is needed, then so be it.  But rushing into something quickly that clearly has medical and psychological consequences should be done cautiously and thoughtful.",

But I have been thinking that that post was wrong. The fear that disguises itself as fact must be dealt with, and it is worth condemning for the terrible things that it does\n\nYou are right that people are \"concerned\" (your first line). They are afraid that our situation is the same as Europe's, but it is not. The only place from where it is easy to cross into Canada is the U.S. It is very difficult to get to Canada and the U.S. because of geography.\n\nThere are no facts that say Islam is the world's most violent religion. Who, after all, has most of the world's largest, most powerful militaries? Christians.\n\nThe rest of what you say is just simply wrong. I doubt that you are lying. You are just imagining something inaccurately, and it is frightening you. And that has to stop.",
