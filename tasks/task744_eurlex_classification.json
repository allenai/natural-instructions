    "Definition": "In this task, you are provided with an article of the legal acts. Your task is to classify it into three categories (Regulation, Decision and Directive) based on its content: 1) Regulation is a binding legislative act that must be applied in its entirety on a set date across all the member states (European Union countries). 2) Decision is binding on those to whom it is addressed (e.g. an European Union country or an individual company) and is directly applicable. 3) Directive is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all  must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals.",
