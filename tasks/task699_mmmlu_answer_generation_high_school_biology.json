In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?\n(A)Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes. (B)Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits. (C)This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed. (D)A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing",

Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n(A)Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition. (B)Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated. (C)DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly. (D)Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.",
