I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry.

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings.  The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right.  Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record.  For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' \"Freak In\" or the aforementioned E.S.T",

Melanie White and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to \"Appalachia Waltz.\" I highly recommend Oliver Schroer's double-disc \"O2\". Same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin. In places astoundingly brilliant. Lovers of Bach will see many influences here (yet I wouldn't call Schroer's work derivative.) In the liner notes, Schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal--funny thing is, the more you listen, the more \"fractal\" it sounds. Unbelievable.",

More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's \"For Once In My Life\" and Glady Knight and the Pips' \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them.  Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.

            "input": "The best of all . I have heard several Bohemes in my time - my favorites being the versions with Pav and Freni; Tebaldi and Bergonzi; and this one. Neither of the first two can match this recording in overall effect. Karajan with Pav/Freni, while firmly in possession of his own wonder, misses by a hair Beecham's sensuous conducting logic. Also Pav is not the best Rodolfo: he sings too opulently to convey a blue, starving poet. The Tebaldi/Bergonzi set is a sure contender, and might have stood right with this one if its sound weren't so bad.         Now as for this set itself - three words say it: Bjoerling with Beecham. These were two of the finest artists of the last century, and it is a blessing to have this record of their collaboration. Jussi, while perhaps not as romantic as Bergonzi, was a Rodolfo for all time. That ringing golden tenor truly could build castles in air. And hell, he was romantic enough for comfort. Add Beecham, and, if you please, you've got glory. His pacing is perfect. Just listen to about midway through \"che gelida manina,\" where Bjoerling soars and Beecham expands the tempo to let Jussi's voice raise the rafters and burn deep. And I tell you what, Jussi could burn. The quantity of air that man had was astonishing at the least, and he didn't waste it: his phrases are easy, well-drawn, and thrilling.        I have no important complaints about anyone else in the cast. I actually prefer de Los Angeles's Mimi, though I think she sometimes doesn't support high notes with enough air. As for the orchestra, there are a few mishaps where accurate entrances with the singers are concerned, but that is hardly surprising - the ensemble was assembled in roughly two days and its memebers had barely played with one another or with Beecham. The sound of the set isn't as good as one might expect from the Great Recordings series, but it is acceptable, and a well-informed ear can fill in any lacking overtones.    Buy it. You'll love it for many years, and then pass down through your family",

I mean I guess what I am trying to say is that I sorta liked the Nickleback CD in the beginning, but once my girlfriend said she hated it I figured I got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the Joss Stone CD which at first seemed like a much better CD to have than Nickelback. I think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then I guess I just have to live with the Nickelback CD, but I'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me. BLEH!!

            "input": "Very atmospheric soundtrack with some heavier moments . This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film \"La Vallee\" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the \"dry\" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).    Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus \"relieving\" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.    Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.    With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.    All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).",

None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice.

It caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me.  I would like to say thank you to Otis Redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music, and for creating this incredible album.

That's because we don't have the kind of wreckless visionaries that the 70s had, like Dr. John and George Clinton. These guys were so far gone into their music that they bordered on being parodies of themselves, and somehow that translated into the kind of raw and unprecedented energy that makes their music so saturated in what one would ideally define as 'funky'. Take Dr. John: the dude is basically the white George Clinton, with his crazy head dresses and honky tonk muppet voice. Put him in front of a piano, get the Meters to lay down the tightest funk grooves you've ever heard, and add producer Alain Toussaint's canjun roots and you've got an exceptionally enjoyable album in \"In The Right Place\". The music is uplifting and listenable; The Meters take the house down with some thick bass riffs, brilliantly arranged horns and tight-as-hell percussions. Dr. John wails like a drunken canjun cartoon character, which is such an endearing and appropriate compliment to this musical experience that you will not know how to listen to this kind of funk without a voice as original and funky as this.    While the entire album provides a consistent line-up of quality jams, the two stand-outs that have become two of Dr. John's greatest hits are \"Right Place, Wrong Time\" and \"Such A Night\". \"Right Place, Wrong Time\" would fill any dance floor with its danceability factor, while \"Such A Night\" is a kind of honky tonk interpretation of a faster-paced soul ballad, with great backing vocals and a nostalgic, Bugsy Malone-sounding keys section.    This album is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the funk. Dr. John is a true pioneer in the genre and, while most of his work is worth owning, this is nonetheless one of his best albums to prove it",

He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.    \"Get Your Hustle On\" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  \"I Know You Know\" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  \"Around The Way\" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  \"Sets Go Up\" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single \"Rodeo\" is the millennium version of \"Back That [...] Up\" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  \"What's Happenin'\" is nothing to write home about, \"Loose Booty\" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and \"Break A Brick Down\" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. \"Who's Ya Daddy\" is pointless, along with the annoying \"Keep Talkin'\" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and \"Why Not.\"  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on \"Rock Like That.\"  The biggest shocker has to be \"Addicted\" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of \"The Rain.\")      There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come.",

With Tricky already having success with his own newly made group Portishead, & with their massive hit album Dummy just around the corner, there was alot of pressure on Massive Attack. So on the album they used Everything but the girl's Tracy Thorn on lead vocals to replace Blue Line's female vocalist Shara Nelson, although she would return for the 1998 smash hit album Mezzanine.    The album begins with the lushous Protection, the groups sound has definitely changed, as it's more of a heavy beat than the first album & Tracy's vocals really work here. Karma Koma is next, this would be a very popular radio hit, and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song. Three is quite a dark track, again Tracy on vocals here, whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental Weather Storm continues into the darkness. Spying Glass is a more of a hip tune, performed by Del Naja, whilst Better Things is a smooth sould tune, skillfully performed by Tracy. Euro Child is suprisingly the first rap song since Karma Koma (I say suprisingly as Blue Lines contained alot of rap tunes in it) Tracy's on vocals again for Sly, which returns kinda into the darkness, whilst if Sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album Heat Miser is definitely in the darkness. The album strangely ends with a live rendition of The Doors classic Light my Fire, but done in Massive style, it has to be heard to be believed!!!!    Protection is definitely different from its predecessor Blue Lines & whilst I'd definitely recommend it, I think I would advice people who are new to the group to buy Blue Lines first as Protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first. The band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release Mezzanine!!!",

This recording of Messiah is an attempt at using period instruments (either authentic or replicas from the Baroque period) and performing it in the correct manner of \"Baroque performance\" (at least as best as we can know).  Clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off, but the result does seem to be very Baroque.      Reviewers have two main objections, which the prospective listener should keep in mind.  Many Messiah fans are used to \"un-Baroque\" performances of Messiah--a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone, a large orchestra, large dynamic contrasts, and slower tempos.  When people accustomed to such performances hear Hogwood's recording, it is often labeled as \"dry,\" \"unemotional,\" or \"light.\"      Other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself.  I think that the soloists could do a better job.  The bass is strong, but he could be better, and I think there should be more ornamentation overall.  I personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir, but others may differ.    Other Baroque recordings such as Gardiner, McGegan, or Harnoncourt are also good period recordings.  If you want more traditional interpretations, take a look at Thomas Beecham's or Robert Shaw's recordings.  If you're looking for a complete, scholarly interpretation, however, I think this is a great recording.  Oh, and the accompanying booklet is great, too--very thorough.",

Yet lyrics as \"Born down in a dead man's town, The first kick I took was when I hit the ground, You end up like a dog that's been beat too much, Till you spend half your life just covering up\" could hardly be called patriotic or shallow.    Born in the USA was the follow-up for Nebraska, a sparse demo-like recording. A lot of the material here was culled from those sessions and had the E-Street bravura added to them. The title track was originally a one-man rockabilly outing but transformed in E-Street synth-rock. The same treatment songs as Dancing in the Dark, Glory Days or I'm on Fire got. It's that treatment that's ultimately the weakness of the record. Today Born in the USA sounds hopelessly dated at times. The listener is forced to listen beyond the production for its depth and meaning. At the time of its release it was no different. A lot of the lyrics meanings tend to get lost in the poppy production that made it so successful. It is also one of Springsteen least cohesive efforts. The styles on the album range from pop to rockabilly, from stadium rock to folk. For those who take the effort to dig deeper into the record there is a wealth in the songs that is rarely matched by other artists.    As never before Springsteen paints a picture of those of us who fail to be a part of the American Dream. There is the obvious post-Vietnam protest song of the title track, not allowing us to forget, and its attack on Reaganism. But there is more. In I'm on Fire the character bears his soul as Bruce sings, \"At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet, and a freight train running through the, middle of my head, Only you can cool my desire\". Sex being the means through which the character forgets his angst for just a moment. Similar sentiments are found in Dancing in the Dark, Bruce's ultimate pop effort. \"Man I'm just tired and bored with myself\" screams the character, \"Hey there baby, I could use just a little help\", hardly a light and upbeat lyric. The people in Springsteen's songs seem to be stuck in their lives, unable to get ahead. The chances the American Dream offers us are accessible only to just some of us. The rest are left behind \"just sitting back trying to recapture, a little of the glory of, well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but, boring stories of glory days\"",

This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom.  This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has.     The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill.     That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about.",

HOLD THE FAITH: With his debut album release, VIRTUOUS WOMAN, Warrior King cemented a reputation as one of Jamaica's hottest conscious singers in recent years. Singles like NEVER GO WHERE PAGANS GO and VIRTUOUS WOMAN bust up the Jamaican charts, and established young Warrior King as a major talent with strong vocal range, delivering cultural as well as lovers' lyrics for some of the island's biggest producers. In light of such a powerful debut, HOLD THE FAITH turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. The album opens with an interesting introductory segment, and then the title track, which is decent but nothing to run out into the streets and shout about. From thereon out, HOLD THE FAITH rides a few crests - like the herbally inspired MEDITATION on the PASS THE KUTCHIE (FULL UP) rhythm, or the catchy sing-along, EDUCATION - but mostly hovers right around average, or at worst, sinks to sadly uninspired. Listening to forgettable roots-by-numbers efforts like FREEDOM and JUDGMENT DAY, there's little evidence that this is the work of the same singer whose compelling chanting style carried a modern classic like POWER TO CHANT to the top every reggae playlist. Even worse, there are a couple of performances - particularly the dreadful EVERYDAY - that sound like phone-ins; a real let-down, and not at all what you'd expect from an artist of Warrior King's caliber. Overall, I really believe that HOLD THE FAITH is just a misstep, and that if we can indeed hold the faith, Warrior King will be back to reward us with his very best before too long. Until then, this will just have to do",

Two months before Billy Higgins' death, the drummer &amp; Charles Lloyd say their musical farewells with the tapes rolling (courtesy Lloyd's partner Dorothy Darr, who also made a film of proceedings).  They play sax/drums duets (Lloyd mostly on alto, in fitting homage to Ornette Coleman, though he also plays excellent Traneish tenor on three tracks); they perform exotic woodwind/percussion duets, with Lloyd on Tibetan oboe or flute; Higgins plays guimbri (the 3-stringed instrument used in Gnawa music), sings gently (&amp; rather dodgily) in a variety of languages, even plays a blues on the guitar or does a 1960sish paean to love called &quot;Take a Chance&quot;; Lloyd adds short meditations at the piano.  Some of these tracks don't mean much outside the context of this session--the piano solos get a bit too samey, &amp; there's too much voice'n'guitar (though the blues is rather nice).  Others are superb--the two long alto/drums duos (one on each disc) are great stuff, &amp; Lloyd's tenor pieces are also superb (there's a nice Traneish blues on disc 2).  The more exotic pieces are often quite ravishing.  I suppose that many listeners will for sentimental reasons like having all this stuff, the unalloyed good tracks as well as those that only acquire real significance in the face of Higgins' own personal tragedy.  I'm less sentimental when it comes to what goes on my stereo: I could have wished for a carefully selected single CD of the highlights, which would have been a genuinely outstanding disc.

It features a classic line up of Clark on piano, John Coltrane on tenor, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor  on drums. All of the artists are comfortable in the session and no one  musician dominates the set. The selections are arranged as to give everyone  room to stretch and explore the collection of standards and Clark  originals. Sonny's light, nimble touch is on display throughout the  session. His solos are well worth listening to several times and swing on  each track. Curtis Fuller has a warm, tender solo on the standard Come Rain  Or Come Shine, and Coltrane shines on Speak Low. Everyone gets room to blow  on the uptempo opening track, With a Song in My Heart, with Byrd's bright  brassy trumpet leading the way. Finally, Clark's compositional skills shine  thru on the classic that closes the set, News For Lulu. This is another  great Blue Note &quot;Connoisseur&quot; reissue of a &quot;lost  classic&quot;, it gets one star automatically for putting all of the  alternates at the end of the album instead of stringing them behind the  master takes. I recommend this set as a classic straight ahead swinging  hard bop date, especially to fans of the &quot;Blue Note sound&quot",

            "input": "One of the Best Rap Albums of the Year . The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is the Trout Mask Replica of rap.  Madlib, much like Captain Beefheart, has a unique style that is hard to penetrate and hard to pin down.  The songs on this album aren't really songs per se, they are more like random clips and odd ball samples with the occasional spattering of rhyme thrown in.  The album is dizzying to listen to.  Their must be 50 or 60 little mini skits, song fragments, and other oddities sprinkled through the album.  All this combines to make one of the best and innovative rap albums to come down the pipe this year.    Madlib/Quasimoto has created an innovative and unique production style that he created with the first Quasimoto album the Unseen, continued with the excellent Madvillian record, and continues to refine with this production.  Overall I think that his production sounds more complete on this record than on Madvillian.  What makes this a weaker release than Madvillian is the quality of lyrics and the MC involved.    Quasimoto is not as good as MF Doom.  Quasimoto seems to be riffing on Doom's style throughout, and his voice can get kind of irritating.  He sounds like Eminem on helium and without all the homophobic gay bashing.  It's an interesting trick, kind of like what Prince did on If I Was Your Girlfriend, but extended for a whole album.  His style can be grating though.      Overall, The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is a good album that fans of off-kilter alternative rap will love.  If you like Dr. Octagon, MF Doom, Peanut Butter Wolf, or Aesop Rock, then you'll enjoy this.  You want to be patient with it though, Madlib's style is like peeling an onion, you need to remove some of the outer layers before you can get the full effect of it.",

(For a measure of my enthusiasm, see my review of the Yazoo set.)      If you dig him enough, or are curious enough, to want his entire output in one place for a budget price, then by all means this is the package to buy.    But completeness and price are the top virtues of this set.  If you want to hear these records at their best, with careful attention to making them sound clear and present, the Yazoo one-disc compilation still leads the pack, far and away.    Except for a slightly better mastering job, these four discs mirror the four separate BLJ volumes on Document.  In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that these _are_ the old Document masters, run through a noise reduction system.  The sound quality is quite uneven:  the better-sounding takes sound pretty good, but some of the others are awful.    The version of \" 'Lectric Chair Blues,\" one of Lemon's finest records, as heard here is terribly worn and noisy, to the point of being unintelligible.  Also true of the same track on the Document.  On Yazoo, it's a wonderful listen and you can hear and understand all of the words.    \"Long Lonesome Blues,\" take 2, is also nearly inaudible.  On the Yazoo, it sounds as if they may have been working with the same 78 disc, but the results are much improved.    JSP Records gained a stellar reputation because its earliest roots-and-jazz compilations were mastered by the late John R. T. Davies, who was a genius at resurrecting old recordings and making them sound real.  But this is not one of those sets.    So:   With Lemon Jefferson, you always get quality music, and with this JSP collection you get nearly all of it.  (Several alternate takes are not here.)   But if sound quality is an issue, I have to recommend Yazoo's \"Best of.",

If someone were to rush up to me and hold a gun to my hand and insist that I recommend one and only one Jesus & Mary Chain album to someone completely unfamiliar with their music with the proviso that it be THE album that would bring that person the most enjoyment, I would be in a complete quandary (though why some insane person would be wielding a pistol in such a nutty undertaking I won't speculate about).  On the one hand, PSYCHOCANDY is unquestionably their masterpiece, not merely a great album, but one of the great precursors of the emergence of alternative music in the nineties.  Yeah, alternative went pop when Nirvana hit it big with NEVERMIND in 1991, but the Jesus & Mary Chain had already copped all the right attitudes and struck all the right chords with PSYCHOCANDY in 1985.  With that album they go down with the Velvet Underground, Television, and Big Star as bands that wield an influence vastly in excess of their collective record sales.      But as great as PSYCHOCANDY is, I'm not sure that 21 SINGLES:  1984-1998 doesn't have better songs.  The collection of singles pulls together not merely the very best songs off PSYCHOCANDY, but a host of great songs off other albums that either weren't as good or weren't very good at all, but nonetheless had a couple of great individual cuts.  For instance, back when I was collecting Jesus & Mary Chain discs, I stopped with PSYCHOCANDY, DARKLANDS, and BARBED WIRE KISSES, two albums and an anthology.  This means that I missed out on some really great cuts that are collected here.  For instance, I was completely blown away by \"Head On\" the first second I heard it, but because I didn't get AUTOMATIC, it was completely new to me.  Same thing is true of \"Blues from a Gun,\" the very scary \"Reverence,\" \"Sometimes Always\" (with guest lead vocal by Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star), and the wonderful pair of cuts from MUNKI, \"I Love Rock N Roll\" and \"I Hate Rock N Roll.\"  These are just great songs, and they really make me regret that I stopped my collecting of their music when I did.      So, I truly hope gun-toting maniacs stay away from me, but if saner, more everyday folk want who are unacquainted with one of the great bands of the eighties and nineties want to dive into their music, I would strongly recommend both PSYCHOCANDY and 21 SINGLES: 1984-1998.  This music is as crucial as anything that arose during the period",

Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.      It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad \"Be Not Always\" and the danceable \"State of Shock.\"      \"State of Shock\" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)    And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, \"Body\" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, \"Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!\" or words to that effect.",

Songs that I particularly enjoy are \"Stealing Kisses\", \"I Want You\", \"Paris\" and \"Mississippi Girl\".  I've read other reviews that said 'Fireflies' left them confused.  The album's songs do lack cohesiveness at times, but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of Faith's voice.  She has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music",

Some of the songs jam, and some are more mellow, beautiful peices.  There are a couple duds that I never listen to (namely, \"Trundrumbalind\" and \"Raspberry Delta Jam-V\", and \"Up In The Sky\" I also usually skip), but the rest of the songs are fantastic.  \"Train Of Angels\" is the best of the bunch, along with \"Love Thing\" (gorgeous).  \"Time\" is also a fantastic, dreamy track, \"A Piece Of Liquid\" is relaxing and sounds like something you'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool \"night-time-sounding\" soloing.  It's impossible not to tap your feet during \"Psycho Monkey\" or \"House Full Of Bullets\",and I love the awesome playing at 1:40 in \"Secret Prayer\".  \"With Jupiter In Mind\" and \"Crystal Planet\" are great space-themed rockers, and \"Lights Of Heaven\" is one of Joe's best.     If you only buy ONE Satriani album, I first and formost recommend The Electric Anthology and Surfing With The Alien, but then I also recommend you pick up Crystal Planet, and Time Machine (not the most consistent album, but there are some here that you simply can't miss)",

OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).    Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.    If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.    Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.

White Zombie made some of the most amazing music of the 90s. I like Hellbilly Deluxe, it's a very good album, not near as tantalizing as anything White Zombie did, but still very good. This album however is a complete departure from everything before it. The only good tracks are Sinners Inc & Transylvanian Transmissions, what some would call \"fillers\" a labeling i despise, these 2 tracks are amazing, and the ozzie track is alright, but everything else is just mindless ramblings and power cords rolled into a brainless shpeil of banter about nothing. I so do not dig this whole poppy thing hes doin in the slightest. Hellbilly deluxe is a far supirior album, while this album is not even worthy of being compared to anything White Zobmie did.

Overall the album has excellent flow, ie. the hit songs aren't the first on the album.   -Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album.   I hope NIN will continue.

Don't get me wrong, this album is worth your money, especially if you are a fan of dance/DJ music. Very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe",

Led by Susanna Hoffs' melodic vocals, Michael Steele's bass, Vicki Peterson's guitar, and Debbi Peterson's drums, the Bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today.  This CD is loaded with great songs, including \"Going Down to Liverpool\", the classic \"Manic Monday\", \"If She Knew What She Wants\", the #1 \"Walk Like an Egyptian\", \"Hazy Shade of Winter\" from the movie \"Less Than Zero\", the upbeat \"In Your Room\", and another #1 \"Eternal Flame\"    This greatest hits CD is the perfect collection for the person who doesn't want to go out and buy each individual album.

Whereas the CD contains many beautiful works, there are three that are sublime and deserve mention.     \"Nambu Ushioi Uta\" a Japanese folksong is a unique work as the sad willow melody is pierced by sharp flute interruptions, like an obstinate sparrow continually breaking the silence of melancholy. The piece tip-toes like an elegant silk veil floating on a branch over a night garden.  With its broken pacing, the melodies remain sad and reflective, but always interrupted by the pesty bird chirp, like a crocus on a dark mid-winter morning.    \"Defune\", a mature echoing ghosty melody builds a sad journey of experience and time. I would listen to this song over and over, allowing it to release any grief that I harbored. There is a lilting passage that builds and allows the harp to mirror or reflect the building lilting passage established by the flute. Then the piece moves toward a resolution of quite contemplation.    The CD ends with \"Sakura Sakura\" which Rampal and Laskine play for all it is worth, starting with a minimal slow paced introduction of the melody which is no sooner established than is rendered with a pastoral interpretation of the classic tune. And as the flute wavers like a songbird, a triump of music begins to build and anchors the central presentation of the work.  Now having established and adorned this rich tapestry, Rampal and Laskine begin pulling every golden and silver thread from this whole cloth to integrate minimal repetitions of the central melody finally offered to us in atonal windstorms and durges, retaining its uncanny beauty, made even more beautiful by the lack of perfection, the final sour note.     This CD is superb in that it balances the 3 tragic pieces I describe above with 8 other works of more gaity and light. I predict that this will be one of your favorite CDs for years to come",

At once, the lyrics are memorable and catchy. The vocalists, Cuddy and Keelor, each bring their own qualities which never grow old with Cuddy having impressive range while Keelor brings at times, a nice raspiness with a clever edge. \"Bad Timing\", one of the great tunes off this gem, would soar on the country charts if given a chance. With the exception of \"Til I Gain Control Again\" *brilliantly covered earlier by Crsytal Gayle and later by Willie Nelson*, all the tunes are penned by Cuddy and Keelor, as are their efforts on other Blue Rodeo albums. I had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at The Ramshead Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland. They DID NOT disappoint. If you're looking for GREAT music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio, this is a MUST! I would also suggest their DVD, \"Burning Snowmen\", which chronicles them over time.

            "input": "Deeply devout music from our greatest Christian composer . This disc contains three works by Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina, an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles: \"In croce\", \"Silenzio\", and \"Sieben Worte\". The common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan. The latter is a type of Russian accordian played here by Elsbeth Moser, who performed in the Western premier of \"Sieben Worte\" and to whom Gubaidulina dedicated \"Silenzio.\" Cello is played by Maria Kliegel, who has performed under the approval of Rostropovich.    \"In Croce\" was originally written in 1979 as a piece for organ and cello, but it is represented here in a 1991 arrangement for cello and bayan by Elsbeth Moser which Gubaidulina has approved. It is an exploration of \"vertical\" music (the organ or bayan) intersected by the \"horizontal\" (cello), thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in Gubaidulina's work. Personally, I prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by Ivashkin and Hicks released by Chandos, for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan. Still, Kliegel's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing, less restrained than Ivashkin's but perhaps more passionately religious.    \"Silenzio\" is a fragile, insubstantial piece for bayan, violin, and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo. It consists of five \"miniatures\" which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways. It is an interesting experiment, but it results in the least interesting item on this disc, and it's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power.    \"Sieben Worte (Seven Words)\" for cello, bayan, and strings, is a crucial piece in this disc, and in Gubaidulina's oeuvre in general. I have said before that the composer's \"Johannes-Passion\" may be the greatest work of Christian piety of our time, but \"Sieben Worte\" follows not very long behind. It is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition, and contains quotations from Heinrich Schuetz and clear influence from Haydn. Nonetheless, the bulk of the piece shows the originality of Gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here, but which is included in the liner notes. The strings of the Camerata Transsylvanica (ironically based in Budapest after the emigration of its members) under Gyorgy Selmeczi are intense and unfaltering.     As is unfortunately usual with Naxos discs, the weak point is the liner notes. The English and German are, inexplicably, two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other. Keith Anderson's English commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional. Teresa Pieschacon Raphael's German commentary tells something about Gubaidulina's place in the Soviet music community which English readers too should have been able to enjoy. Though Naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages, the profile of the performers is only in English.    These three pieces, especially the last, make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer, and at an economic price. This is one of the finest works in my collection, and I sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone",

At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days);  then I distinctly heard Hank;  on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days).  All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams.  But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride.  If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.  As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet.  Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off.  While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts:  \"I Gotta Get Drunk\", \"The Last Song I'll Ever Sing\", and \"Shoot The Buffalo\" all showcase his voice.  And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding \"Fraulein\" and \"Who'll buy the Wine\".  This is one of those albums you have to own;  and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++",

The Iveys, who later changed their name to Badfinger, are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group. Though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material, with Pete Ham's \"Black and White Rainbows\" as the strongest track.

The Hollies sounding tracks \"Technicolour Dream\" and \"Ivy Unrehearsed\" are my favourites.     The obscure band \"The U No Who\" who later turned into \"Bachdenkel\", deliver some of the very best recordings to the CD. Quite amazing that Apple did not offer the band a contract.

The title SONGS ABOUT F--KING rendered in loving bold, and cover art that puts all \"shock rockers\" (that means you, Marilyn Manson) in their place. That alone makes it worth adding to your collection. Too bad this was the band's last release. Leave it to Steve to break a band up just as they were attracting an audience.      Big Black is pure nihilism in audio form. A young Steve Albini (pre-Shellac and before he was reduced to producing Bush albums) backed by a constantly pulsing drum machine named Roland and furiously feedback-driven guitar noise while ranting his stories of Midwest depravity and illness with an almost infectious glee. This is what happens when Kraftwerk goes to hell (they even cover that German duo's The Model here), or when a bunch of angry, drunk, baseball bat-wielding nerds start playing New Wave while setting a trailer park on fire. Though there have been faster bands, heavier bands, nobody has ever sounded so gritty and hateful as these guys do.      Ah.. enough hyperbole. So, why only four stars (actually 4.5)? Well, there's nothing as great as previous albums' Steelworker, Bad Houses, Kerosene, or Jordan, Minnesota--songs that are so definitive of Big Black's style. However, there are plenty of songs that come awful close: The poppy yet deliciously evil Bad Penny (\"I think I f--ked your girlfriend once, maybe twice, I don't remember\"), the demented almost-surf rock of Columbian Necktie, the eerie proto-industrial grind of Kitty Empire, the vicious Fish Fry, and the lovely free-floating hostility of Tiny, King Of The Jews. Also notable is a cover of Cheap Trick's He's A Whore that strips away the innuendo and leaves just the grimy sleaze.     Essential music for the misanthrope in all of us.

Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. \"Songs of Judy Garland\" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what \"look\" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of \"makeover\". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to \"Liza Minnelli\" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't",

            "input": "If The Beach Boys grew up in Compton... . Psychedelia and hip-hop. Those are two words I never thought I'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005. I still can't get over it. What a phenomenal idea. The Boston based rapper Edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow. He's also the producer, programmer, engineer, sampler...you name it, he does it all. The production held within is bafflingly perfect. He's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop, including the concept. Clocking in at roughly 34 minutes (as most 60s psychedelic records run), there is absolutely no wasted space. This is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine. It's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\", The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", or Pink Floyd's \"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\" would come off as such a cohesive set of gems. But it does, and Edan proves he's the man for the job.    The album's intro, \"Polite Meeting Intro\", starts it off with some music that could be from Sponge Bob Squarepants, then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage English vocal samples, we end up in The Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\". It sets it off nicely. Then comes \"Funky Voltro\" featuring Insight, which includes a high-pitched swooping Minimoog played by Edan, and also a funky guitar sample. Then comes \"I See Colours\", a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by Edan. Edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here, boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples. The next cut, \"Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme\", is also one of my favorites. Edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop, including Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash Flash, Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Nas and Ultramagnetic MC's among others. It seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an \"homage\" to old-school emcees, but Edan simply does it better by explaining \"why\" they were true innovators, which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer. \"Murder Mystery\" is a sweet track with some music similar to Jimi Hendrix's \"Are You Experienced\" with that reverse rhythm, then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old \"Odd Couple\" tv show. The next cut, \"Torture Chamber\" featuring flows by Percee P, speeds things up with a dirtier beat, orchestra string arrangements, and a background Pink Floyd sample from \"Dark Side Of The Moon\". Then comes the best collaborative effort on the album; \"Making Planets\" featuring Mr. Lif. Lif was actually the one who turned me on to Edan, as he was featuring on Lif's \"Emergency Rations\" EP and his critically acclaimed \"I Phantom\". The production is especially creepy here, as Lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song. \"Time Out (Segue)\" is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut, \"Rock and Roll\" featuring Dagha. Which features some cool crunching guitars in it's very memorable production. I also love this lyric - \"My mental fabric / to big for Lenny Kravitz / Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet\". \"Beauty\" is up next. This song is really one of my favorites. Like it's title, the soulful production is beautiful. The addictive reverse rhythm, tight drum loops, and soaring flute makes it a huge standout. I also love this lyric - \"I use pens like hallucinogens\". It mixes beautifully into \"The Science of the Two\" featuring Insight once again. This is another one of my favorites (it just keeps getting better as it goes). \"Smile\" is one of the trippier tracks on the album. He couldn't have closed out the album better, than with \"Promised Land\", definitely a standout. It's got a very memorable production, and some sick lyrical spitting from the one, the only, Edan.    I see some people complaining about the short run time (34 minutes). I on the other hand, think it's perfect. There is so much filler in today's hip-hop (underground included), that it's nice to have 13 powerful, memorable, carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on. I've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records, along with a wide array of classic rock, so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head, but this stuff is truly unique. Edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop's greatest innovators lyrically, but he's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible; through hip-hop",

This show is stunning.  I found myself humming melodies from the show - even though I hadn't seen it in over a year (and didn't own the recording)!  The music and lyrics have a way of staying with you.  This is a real work of art - poetry and song, based on the work of Gertrude Stein.      If you're a fan of musicals with soul, wit, and class, then you'll love this.    The voices of Christine Mild and Jenny Powers (Little Women) are extraordinary and Cindy Gold's narration is engaging and uniquely powerful.

Now the facts:Earth Omen,New Horizon and Lost Son were in truth composed as a trilogy by Jon Wearing who had been working with another Michigan artist and associate Dick Wagner after the demise of the Frost.Wagner went on to form Ursa Major and Wearing who had been working in the Detroit music scene since 1966 with the Tidalwaves and had a hit Farmer John signed with Pink with the agreement for the first work 20% of his writing would be distributed equally among the other members of the band who were totally lost and down and out. Testa and Wearing could never see eye to eye, the management had no idea what they were doing, IRS and legal issues and the entire project was a wash and Wearing left to form a very good R&B influenced rock band called Deluxe. Deluxe toured with Joe Walsh, James Cotton, Atlanta Rhythm Section,opened for Seger and many others.Dallas Hodge,Ray Craig,KimballLee,Greg Caulder and Wearing comprised the band that had been targeted by Epic to sign. Leo Fenn part of the Alice Cooper business organization and Wearing pal was the manager until heads got out of control in part do to Johnny Winter's medling and then John Sinclair became the manager and demise of this fine act. Hodge continues to work with Canned Heat overseas and Wearing still provides moments with the Detroit based Ghostband.Wearing attempted to provide some quality to Pink however was stiffled by the mis-management of Clyde Stevers and Marv Wilson.

The particular version of &quot;Blue Monk&quot; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark.  It clocks in at 7:36 (the longest track on the record, most tunes are relatively short, preety much like the Blue Note period length wise) and features some awesome drum work by Blakey.  It is really great to hear Monk in a trio format, he really shines in this scenario.  I would definitely recommend this title to any Monk fan, or anyone wanting to start their Thelonious collection.  It really sets you up for Monk's &quot;original&quot; piano style",

I'm astounded at the number of people that think that an upbeat lovesong like this is supposed to be sung with a voice that conveys angst.  Gritty is putting it mildly, the album version of this song sounds like Chad Kroeger has bronchitis.. curiously enough it sounds very similar to an audio file that's been run through a heavy sound compression codec, which is to say distorted and overall harsh.    I'm certain that this is the version that Santana would have wanted on the album, but Alex Band of the Calling just isn't as big a name as Chad Kroeger of Nickleback, they needed big names to sell it.  So they recorded this altogether better version to play on the radio and in the video to make people think that's what they were getting on the full CD, then pulled a fast one and delivered the bronchitis special edition instead.    On the other hand as the other reviews have suggested, if you liked the album version, if you honestly believe that a love song is supposed to be sung with angst.. and.. er.. grit..  then the CD single is probably not for you",

Larson's last two efforts (Watercolor Sky, Sepia) were both outstanding, polished albums with Hank Linderman at the helm.  This album is more \"raw\" and stripped down in style.  More of Jeff's contemporary edge comes through on Two Part Confessional, as if Linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes.  \"Looking at December\" has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before.  \"Maybe Cascade Idaho\" fully has that Beach Boys/Brian Wilson sound Jeffery Foskett brings to the table and as such, more of a Foskett than Linderman sound. \"A Better Day\" sounds more like an America song than Gerry Beckley has done in decades, and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals, it really bears his presence well. \"The Way Outside\" recalls 1973 Eagles/Walsh/Fogelberg ballads, which Linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style. \"Play Through\" has a AAA radio sound to it, with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar, drums & bass.  \"Only Green\" is a beautiful ballad (i.e. Souveniers), and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of Bruce Gaitsch (Richard Marx, Timothy Schmit) on some of his solo work.  A surprise addition comes after the end, as a short instrumental ensues, no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor.

On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get.

Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and \"deep\", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it.

            "input": "An Excellent Sting Collection . After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A & M released \"Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994\", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings.    Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does \"Fields Of Gold\" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives.    Positives:  -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes \"If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)\", \"Fortress Around Your Heart\", \"Be Still My Beating Heart\", \"Russians\", \"We'll Be Together\", \"All This Time\", \"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\" and \"Fields Of Gold\". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here.  -The sound is great.  -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation.  -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single \"When We Dance\".    Negatives:  -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: \"Love Is The Seventh Wave\" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat.  -\"Mad About You\" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd.  -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of \"We'll Be Together\".  -No liner notes.  -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like \"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\", \"Brand New Day\" and the top twenty hit \"Desert Rose\". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on.    Overall, \"Fields Of Gold\" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection",

Let me start by saying that I thought that Atmosphere's early albums were much better(Most of Atmosphere's current fans have no idea that they had other albums...)But Seven's Travels is Slug and Ant's transformation into a crappy sell-out group, and the first ever emo-rap group. The people that love this album are always some teenager, usually some emo-kid, who decide they like rap and Atmosphere after hearing this album. They jump onto the official Atmosphere bandwagon, but dont think that they listen to rap...they listen to \"rap\". These emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better Atmosphere is, and how underground is the best. (Dont think from this that I am a fan of mainstream rap, i'm just explaining)The number one sign you can tell from, even by just looking at these reviews, is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks(Naturally, these teenage kids like to be different, and can't stop talking about it)or how this is real true rap music. So, basically, these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only Atmosphere album they've ever heard, Sevens Travels and live out their little emo lives listening to Atmosphere(for about 3 months). Even if these people listen to Atmosphere's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate Atmosphere super-fan!)it makes no difference because Atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now. The purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for  emotionally-disturbed teenagers. Go buy some real hip-hop, and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to Sevens Travels",

            "input": "This Is What That \"Cali Iz Active\" Album Should've Sounded Like (Rating: 8 out of 10- -4 stars) . Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's \"The Chronic\". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (\"The Game Is Sold...\") and when he dropped a decent album (\"Paid The Cost...\"). \"The Blue Carpet Treatment\" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.    This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. \"Think About It\" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit \"Thats That...\" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit \"I Wanna Love You\" with Akon, another hit for this album.     As I said in my title, this is what \"Cali Iz Active\" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. \"Candy\" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. \"LAX\" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's \"Going Back To Cali\" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with \"Imagine\" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with \"Conversations\" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).    Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. \"10 Lil' Crips\" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song \"Beatin' Up On Yo Pads\" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.    If you heard that this album was his most consistant since \"Doggystyle\", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters \"Tha Blue Carpet Treatment\".    Lyrics: A-  Production: A-  Guest Appearances: A-  Musical Vibes: B  Overall: A-    My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions    Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads    Peace Everyone!!",

I can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a Led Zepplin song. To create a song with the charge of \"Rock and Roll\", or the lyrics to \"Battle of Evermore\", to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me; and as for \"Stairway\" I think that's beyond any of us mortals. The popular \"Stairway\" had a seemingly unreal start when one day Robert Plant had a pencil and paper and Jimmy Page was just strumming when Plant described it as \"my hand just started writing out the words. I just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat.\" The song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in American history, which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single. But it is not just a Zepplin CD with \"stairway\" on it. It is has so much to offer in every track.   I have grown up with these songs, and if you've ever seen a Ford commercial or just listened to the radio, chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you don't know who Led Zepplin is. But the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of \"Stairway\" is \"When the Levee Breaks\". I always personally found \"Levee\" as the strongest song in Zoso; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber. But \"Levee\" brings this epic Album to an extraordinary close. After every listen, I find it hard to believe that there is only Eight tracks, because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery, and after you have listened to ZOSO whether it be the first time or if it's been too many to count, it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special, done by a band with a sound that is larger than life.

Not only by the touching lyrics, but also by the traditional sound.   I could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music, and was someone who stayed true to his roots.  After listening to this album, I still say all that.    THE DOLLAR is a great traditional country record.  Sure, there are the contemporary \"redneck anthems\"--\"Rebelicious,\" \"Redneck Side of Me,\" even to an extent \"Keepin' Up With the Jonesin\"--but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs.   Johnson's true country gift, however, comes across in other ways.   The enjoyable \"Flying Silver Eagle\" is one of the countriest songs I've heard in a long time (\"I couldn't put my past behind me, so I put it in a song\").   \"She's All Lady\" is a touching tribute to the woman at home, and \"Back to Carolina\" is a powerful number.   \"My Saving Grace\" is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol (\"Daddy passed out with his demons, Mama passed the offering plate...Daddy kept the Devil off my back by taking up His time\").  The CD ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number \"Lead Me Home.\"    Jamey Johnsom, from all appearances, seems the direct musical descendent of George Jones, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, and others--he's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude, but what is really, in fact, simple honesty.   THE DOLLAR is one of the best country albums I've heard in a long time.  Yes, yes, he's the guy who co-wrote \"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,\" but for true die-hard country fans, Johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here...and any more he gets the chance to record in his career.   His voice is undeniably country, his writing skills are formidable, and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering.   God--and the music industry--willing, Jamey Johnson will have a long career ahead of him.  Lord knows, he's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism",

I'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry, in society, among fellow musicians.

I wanted to hate the album so much.  I was an alternative/avant guard snob when AFD was released.  To me, these clowns were just another hairspray band. But I took a long car trip with some chick I was banging and her roommate. The roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip.  By the end, I was hooked.  That's the mark of truly great art.  If it can draw in someone who's predisposed to hate it, its got something special.    I looked forward to the next album, G N' R Lies.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  It was ok, but hardly the cultural epoch that was AFD.  Nice Boys was kind of fun. Used to Love Her was a humorous novelty song. Mama Kin was a decent cover, but no real improvement over the original.  The rest of the disk was just crap.  But what the hell, its was just an EP right? Something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece.    Then came GnR's death knell, the two Use Your Illusions.  Over-produced, bloated, boring and pretentious.  Everything I had always hated Hair-Metal for in the first place.  Gone was the sound of the alley ways of Sunset Boulevard, replaced by the sound of computers, maids and Beverley Hills hookers n blow parties.  Rock n Roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist.    Nothing to see here.  Move along.    So, if you want to see the genius and promise of GnR, just pick up Appetite For Destruction, and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time",

I thought to myself: \"Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte.\" Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as \"emo with estrogen\". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.    They are a whiny band that love to sing about how \"horrible\" and \"tragic\" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's \"deep\" and \"inspiring\" so-called \"music\". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the \"pop-punk\" and \"emo\" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.    Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that \"GC\" are musical gods or are the \"best punk rawk band eva!111!1!\", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are \"old\" and \"horrible\". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like \"XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX\" and \"trU3_pUnk_raWk3r\".    Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:    Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands.  Kid #2: Where did you hear them first?  Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.    Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month?  Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!    Teenybopper talking to herself: \"Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee\"    Ugh.    In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:    Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges  Ramones - The Ramones  London Calling - The Clas",

Barry Manilow began 2006 with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at #1 last February with The Greatest Songs Of The Fifties. In between that album release and this, he has continued to sell out his Las Vegas extravaganza, Music and Passion, five nights a week. The show is so successful that the Las Vegas Hilton recently extended Manilow's contract through 2008. He picked up his second Emmy Award this past August for the live on tape broadcast of that event, and with the release of this album, he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his 32 year recording career. Barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of 2006 to have two Top two records in Billboard in one calendar year. When it came to recording his follow-up to the \"Fifties,\" juggernaut, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be. All it took was Clive Davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go. For the critics who have tarred and feathered Manilow since he hit #1 with his very first single, \"Mandy\" over three decades ago, you'd think by this time they'd cut him some slack. No dice. Manilow has even admitted he wouldn't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic, the Brooklyn-born writer, arranger, producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase. And it's not just any fanbase. These people are hardcore fans, dubbed \"Fanilows.\" On this CD, we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the 60's one of the best eras in pop music history. The pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from Bacharach to the Beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of Frankie Valli's \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You,\" which kicks the disc off into high gear. Other highlights among highlights include a duet with 60's supergroup, The Association, on their staples \"Cherish\" and \"Windy\" that Barry cleverly arranged as a medley. Elvis' gorgeous 1962 ballad \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" is lusciously delivered as is The Righteous Brothers 1965 anthem \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\" Even the somewhat hokey #1 Dean Martin single \"Everybody Loves Somebody\" from 1964 fits in divinely as Manilow gives it as much warmth as Dino did over forty years ago. Sinatra's smash hit from 1966, \"Strangers In The Night\" is so effective, Franks' daughter, Tina, gave Manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation. Other pop staples included are the Herman's Hermits \"There's A Kind Of Hush,\" Bacahrach's gorgeous song from '68 \"This Guy's In Love With You,  as well as his '69 Oscar-winner \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\" The Beatles shimmering 1964 ballad \"And I Love Her\" and Bobby Vinton's 1963 \"Blue Velvet\" is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the 1962 love anthem \"When I Fall In Love\" originally a hit for The Lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching. The album ends on a positive note (pun intended) with the 1965 anthem for hope \"What The World Needs Now Is Love.\" Never was that sentiment so true - never was a Manilow album this gratifying. Everything from song selections to Manilow's masterful arrangements to his honest readings, this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career. Look for The Greatest Songs Of The Seventies inside a year. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure that one out",

Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. .",

The album was the band;s first new studio album in nearly two years and would be their last with guitarist Adrian Smith until his return on 2000's Brave New World(not coincidentally it was also their last masterpiece for twelve years as well). Smith plus lead singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Nicko McBrain made certain that Adrian's last album with Maiden for over a decade was also arguably the band's best album as I found out when I got the Capitol Record cassette version in May of 1988 and later the remastered CD.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was Maiden's first concept album about a cursed child who is born with special powers and it tempted by the side of both good and evil. Also, the band was starting to become more progressive sounding as their music was reminiscent to that of ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and so forth with the tempo changes and lyric-wise.  We begin the album with Moonchild which begins as an acoustic passage giving this album's theme and then it builds into a superb rocker penned by Smith and Dickinson. Next is the superb Infinite Dreams penned by Harris and was a great progressive rocker alternating between quiet and heavy and light and dark sections. Next was the album's biggest hit Can I Play With Madness penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson which sounded reminiscent to the previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time's biggest hit, Wasted Years. Next is The Evil That Men Do also penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson and is another stellar rocker. This song was always one of my favorites.  The album's second half begins with the epic length title cut! Like the 13 plus minute Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and 9 minute Alexander The Great before it, it is the longest and best track on the album. Unlike those two aforementioned epics, the Harris penned title cut was the band's first 10 minute track which they created the story themselves. Wonderful musicianship throughout, especially Murray and Smith's guitar duels at the end which is an awesome piece of music. The Prophecy is next and is a great track penned by Murray/Harris and ends with a superb acoustic guitar section. next is the album's third single The Clairvoyant which is another great rocker. We end the album with arguably one of Maiden's best album closers Only The Good Die Young. This Harris/Dickinson penned piece is a killer rocker. Then when you think the album ended after the big finish, the album ends with a reprise of the acoustic passage that started Moonchild.   Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was another Top 20 charting US million seller and it was because the material was strong, the production was killer and because it was Iron Maiden!  RECOMMENDED",

Mr. Cook is a genious and his singles time & time again are proven not only to be sucessful, but also timeless(aside from the tracks that the top 40 radio DJs get ahold of and cram down our throats a zillion times until we never wanna hear 'em again...  Thanks for that by the way, you're doing the world a great service).  As far as not understanding \"Star 69\",; what is there to understand.  \"Star 69\" was made for one reason & one reason only, to make you shake your butt.  If you're looking for meaning in music, go listen to Yanni, or Enya, or Celine Dion, only listen to Fatboy if you wanna boogie to the MFin' oogie.  As far as the guy bashin' \"Bird Of Prey\", it's Jim Morrison dude; what more do you need.  For those of you who don't know musicians outside of the Backseat Boys, Jim's the lead singer from The Doors, & one of the few truely brilliant musicians of ours any other generation... ever.  Basically I'll put it like this, don't bash on the man because you're to sheltered to understand good music unless it's played for you twice every hour on the hour on the radio or MTV.  Cook's music'll be around alot longer than any one of your 1 hit wonder's out there.  Just because Norman makes his own music, & not from some mold given to him by some slimey record executive doesn't mean his music is bad.  If you don't get it fine, but don't bash on something just because you're to shallow or close minded to understand.  Open your ears and give it a shot, your brain will thank you",

With hands on experience, this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners.  For the most part, \"Bad Girl\" has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the LP.  Hearing Jon reach for the higher notes on \"Can't Help It\" was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive.  The title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track.  2Pac was featured with equal time on \"Are You Still Down\" as he almost stole the show until near the end where Jon B. flexed his abilities.  \"I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)\" is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married.  He then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on \"I Ain't Going Out\".  The inviting \"Can We Get Down\" is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually.

The best cue of them all is the thrilling \"March of the Lava\" which includes all of the main elements of the score, with strong low brass rhythms, pulsating brass trills, ostinato strings, and driving, militaristic snare drums. \"Team Work\" and \"Build A Wall\" are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass, especially those trombone shrill sounds that Elliot Goldenthal has been known to use. \"Main Title\" is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme, but instead uses a light 4 note theme that you never hear again. Some romantic, dramatic music appears in the final track \"Cleansing Rain\" to bring the score to a close. Overall, a great action score that serves both the film and your CD player well",

It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.    Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.    Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it.",

But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, \"whoa!\" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market \"Lonesome Crowded West\" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club?     This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I \"get\" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, \"My thoughts weren't so loud\" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to \"This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About\" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like \"The Moon and Antarctica\" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who \"gets Modest Mouse\" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like \"Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart,\" you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing.     j5w2k9@hotmail.com",

There is a reason why record companies who carry bands like Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine ask very little for their albums: its nothing but noise.

Trying to make it through any of these band's work is like trying to sit through the film Shaoh without an intermission. Granted, I don't smoke weed, so I guess that leaves this music to those of you who aren't doing anything with your lives and who probably still play Dungeons & Dragons in your parents basement, while listening to the likes of Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine.

Drone metal was invented because the creators knew that there would be a massive following of losers just waiting to gobble up something that appeared to be visionary and original.

It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.    The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\"), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on \"Humble Daisy\" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of \"Then She Appeared\" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's \"My Bird Performs\", Partridge's \"The Disappointed\").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material (\"The Ugly Underneath\") seems to blend in with the rest.    It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on \"Dear Madam Barnum\", \"Wrapped in Grey\" twists and turns every which way, \"War Dance\" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.    Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- \"Nonsuch\" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more",

Around the turn of the century, record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials. Needless to say, all of these attempts have failed. Great songs were overlooked, and instead of giving a quality overview of the band, one got instead the feeling of being ripped off. The Cure's Greatest Hits falls victim to the one disc overview.    A greatet hit album serves two purposes. One is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album. The second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career. The problem with The Cure is that they have released over 30 singles, and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work.    For instance, how does a Cure best of ignore \"Pictures of You\"? It would be akin to a Billy Joel best of leaving off \"The Stranger\". This song is considered one of the Cure's best, and leaving this off for stuff like \"The Walk\", \"High\", and \"Never Enough\" is an insult.    While \"Pictures of You\" is the biggest example of a song that is missing, there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there. For instance, the sublime \"Catch\", the melancholy \"A Night Like This\", or even \"Jumping Someone Else's Train.\" And what about their break-out single, \"Killing An Arab\"?

I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.    It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.    The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.    Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.    Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... \"LMN\"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...    Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.    Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.    Track 5 - Ugh.    Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, \"As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word \"radio\" and we'll double what we're giving you.\" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...    Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.    Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?    Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.    Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.    Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.    Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.    Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.    Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...    Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.    Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.    Flame away, kiddies.",

By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's \"trained\" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.    Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.    My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help",

This release includes all ten of the brothers' top 40 hits from 1971 to 1974 (\"One Bad Apple\" through \"Love Me For a Reason\" and \"The Proud One\") plus two additional cuts: \"I Can't Stop\" and their version of \"He Ain't Heavy.\" The 1992 greatest hits compilation on the Curb label is essentially the same disc minus the two additional tracks. \"I Can't Stop\" was recorded in the late sixties back when the brothers were regularly on television on Andy Williams' weekly variety show. The song was released after \"One Bad Apple\" topped the national charts. The flip side of that number one hit was their remake of the Hollies' hit \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother.\" That tune was eventually covered over the next few years by many artists, including Neil Diamond and Olivia Newton-John. If you don't already own the 1992 hits disc or the three disc box set released in 2000 (also on the Curb label) then this is the compilation for you. You may also want to get your hands on the other two recently released \"20th Century Masters\" collections: one covers Donny's solo hits of the 70s plus the other disc features his hit duets with sister Marie from the same decade",

First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.  Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating.  If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System",

I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is \"Worship,\" but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!!     Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!!

            "input": "A timely celebration of a \"double\" 50-year anniversary. . A half century ago, I was a junior in high school. We used to have these gatherings called \"assemblies,\" where the principal would collect the entire student body in the auditorium (no excuses allowed!) for an event of more than passing importance. At this late date, I can only remember a small handful of them: the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, President Truman relieving General MacArthur of his command. Oh, and one where two fellows from Ampex came to our high school to give a little demonstration of something called \"stereophonic sound,\" using, needless to say, an Ampex tape recorder.    And the music for this demonstration? It was the brief opening prologue (\"Sunrise\") from Richard Strauss's \"Also Sprach Zarathustra,\" in this very same Reiner/Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording. This was a \"sneak preview to end all sneak previews,\" inasmuch as the monophonic LP (\"New Orthophonic,\" I believe it was called) hadn't even been released at that early date. And, needless to say, this impressionable teenager was suitably impressed. So much so that, in the years to come, I acquired three LPs of the performance: the original monophonic LP, then the Living Stereo LP a few years later, and eventually, when the stereo LP had seen its better days, the Dynagroove rerelease (something I'd just as soon forget). I never did go the reel-to-reel route, and, when CDs eventually made their appearance, I opted for other performances of these two Strauss works rather than the earlier conventional Living Stereo CD release. But I always did have fond memories of that particular reel-to-reel tape demonstration back in '54; it was a direct copy of the 30ips master tape, and not the 7.5ips \"consumer\" version that came out shortly thereafter.    With BMG now releasing half-century-old Living Stereo classics as hybrid SACDs (10 at present, with surely more on the way), it was easy for me to select this recording as one of the first to sample. I was more than pleasantly surprised; just listening to the \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" prologue had the effect of turning the clock back 50 years; truly a trip down Memory Lane!    In a phrase, I wasn't disappointed. Even listening to the conventional CD layer, it was easy to get the sense that there I was again, listening to the 30ips master tape. Even with headphones, I heard no evidence of tape hiss; just beautifully balanced stereo sound with a tremendous sense of not only left-to-right spatial array but depth as well. (This is particularly evident in \"The hero's battlefield\" segment of \"Ein Heldenleben,\" where the initial muted trumpet fanfares sound as if they are coming from well behind the orchestra.) Throughout both massive tone poems, the music is well-served by RCA's \"minimalistic\" microphoning, with just two mikes picking up the sound field, and every single instrumental voice (and there are many of them) can clearly be heard. (Sir Thomas Beecham, that evergreen source of bon mots, reserved one of his best for \"Ein Heldenleben\" when he wrote that \"I once spent a couple of days in a train with a German friend. We amused ourselves by discovering how many notes we could take out of 'Ein Heldenleben' and leave the music essentially intact. By the time we finished we had taken out fifteen thousand.\")    As for Reiner's interpretations, perhaps the simplest way of putting it is that there is no time in the last half century that I can recall when these two performances were NOT included in EVERY \"essential recordings\" discography (even when the sound quality was not as it is here, in the hybrid SACD release). Reiner had a way of not oversentimentalizing these two works, as if they had been the products of one of the world's greatest egos, which, in fact, they were: Strauss made no bones about himself being the hero of \"Ein Heldenleben.\" Reiner keeps things moving along, lest they bog down for the empty rhetoric that they can often be in lesser hands.    A century ago, when Strauss had been the most famous composer who was also a conductor and Gustav Mahler had been the most famous conductor who was also a composer, audiences couldn't get enough of the Strauss tone poems. (I think, in fact, that the record will show that Mahler conducted Strauss's tone poems more frequently than he did his own symphonies!)    And a half-century ago, when I had been in my musical adolescence, so to speak, I too couldn't get enough of them. But they haven't worn all that well in the intervening years. Now, considerably older and modestly wiser, I can only take them in infrequent doses. (Perhaps I've simply taken Strauss at his word when he described himself as \"a first-rate second-rate composer.\") And, fortunately for this now-jaded me, these Reiner performances, long perfect in everything but sound quality, have arrived with, finally, sound quality that matches the performances.    I have every expectation that future \"essential  recordings\" discographies will continue to include these performances, now with this newly-refurbished sound quality that is the match of any.

I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.    But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.      I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much \"pop\", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about \"different\", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.      Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called \"keyboard solo\" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.      I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.      Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from \"good\" to \"great\".      Support your local library.

This whole album is banging, and for you young cats, here's a little history:    \"Let's Chill\" was released by GUY in `90/'91, (of course everybody knows Teddy Riley's name - if not, come on now, you need to educate yourself on one of the top 5 producers of all time...). Who in GUY sang \"Lets Chill\"? Aaron Hall. Who was Aaron Hall's inspiration? Matter of fact - who was Aaron Halls ENTIRE vocal style based on? Who did Aaron Hall himself admit to admiring growing up and mimicking his style? CHARLIE WILSON. It's even been quoted that \"...even his vocal distinction is strangely similar to that of Charlie Wilson, a member of the R&B/Funk group The Gap Band\".  If you are a rookie, please listen to the old GAP BAND albums, and you will see who Aaron Hall sounds exactly like - lead singer Charlie Wilson. I actually give more props to Charlie Wilson for STILL being able to continue to release albums and make hits, while Aaron Hall seems to still be in that black hole of nowhere for quite a few years.  Moving forward, with the new \"Lets Chill\" remake, Charlie is really just putting it down just like GUY did, except with the same style that Aaron Hall bit off of him.  Man, maybe it's just me, but I think a lot of people putting reviews on here really don't really know their music..",

Gid Tanner is a legendary old-time fiddler, so much so that old-time fans are frequently seen wearing t-shirts that say \"Gid is My Co-Pilot\".

None of the styles are any better or worse, just different, and serious old-time fans will enjoy picking apart the nuances of styles.

Well, I hear Johnny has a few health issues, and I only mentioned my own in order to be able to say that he sounds on this album a little like I feel, sometimes. His voice has weakened quite a bit, and thinned out, but as with the change in Bob Dylan's voice, he actually sounds more musical, sweeter, now, than before. So the burning glory is gone, and the blistering solos are replaced with very carefully phrased and finished riffs. And, yes, a little lacking in energy at some points. The Monkey Song is almost too skanky to be believed. Hell, Johnny, they're all shaved on the internet these days anyway, and that's probably as far as some lame old guy like you gets, right?  Sorry.

The main difference between the two albums is the lyrics: Sly seemed to be in a much better mood when this one was recorded. This disc seems a little looser and jazzier too. The instrumental \"Green Eyed Monster Girl\" is a good example, with a funky keyboard solo that sprawls over the entire four minute track. The liner notes indicate that Sly had a heavy hand in the recording of \"High On You\", stating that he played \"Everything - ?!!\". It makes sense then that this album was credited to him rather than Sly and the Family Stone. However, this album seems to have been dismissed, which is a shame.

I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material.

This collection focuses on the late '70's - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jam's &quot;Black Betty&quot; kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of '77 rolled around, moviegoers hadn't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams' original score was released - this version by Meco titled &quot;Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band&quot;, which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled &quot;Baby Come Back&quot;, released during early '78. Player's success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilson's &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that we've gotten that senseless, moronic &quot;tune&quot; out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single &quot;I've Got A Line On You&quot; in the late '60's, contributes here with his only solo chart effort &quot;Thunder Island&quot;, released in the Spring of '78. If it's wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, there's Dan Hill's &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of '78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevon's &quot;Werewolves Of London&quot;. Moviegoers in the Winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates' &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of '78 after the motion picture's release. Wales's Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with &quot;It's A Heartache&quot; during the Summer of '78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;. Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with &quot;Kiss You All Over&quot;, written by two of the group's members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70's and early '80's. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, there's Walter Egan's top twenty smash &quot;Magnet And Steel&quot;, which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as &quot;Telephone Man&quot; is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Parton's &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, or Firefall's &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot; (both released in Autumn of '77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Even though we're stuck with TM, &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series",

            "input": "irresistible Nicolette--catchy, sexy, fun . If you're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s California pop-rock sound' (and who in the right mind isn't?), then the late Nicolette Larson's 1979 album \"In the Nick of Time\" is an album you should definitely have in your collection. This was Nicolette's follow up to her debut album, 1978's \"Nicolette\", and it's actually a better album, easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on \"Nicolette\" in favor of infectious, no-nonsense pop-rock.  Although \"In the Nick of Time\" is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks, it's largely a splendid album.  Nicolette's fun, innocently sexy presence and her irresistible, husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with \"Dancin' Jones\" and \"Breaking Too Many Hearts\", the driving, riffy pop-rocker \"Just In the Nick of Time\", & \"Daddy\" which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol' California sound.  Also great is the breezy, feel-good ballad \"Fallen\", & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored \"Rio De Janeiro Blue\" (which is suspiciously, and strikingly, reminiscent of Steely Dan's \"Your Gold Teeth\", especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track). \"Back In My Arms Again\", a Motown cover, isn't exactly a great song in the first place, but it's given an agreeably energetic performance. The cover of Karla Bonoff's \"Isn't It Always Love\" is nicely done, though it's quite similar to Karla's own version & not as strong, & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky Little Feat cover \"Trouble\" which is quite annoying. The biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with Michael McDonald \"Let Me Go, Love\" which is a splendid, soothing ballad.  As with the previous & subsequent albums, this one was produced by Ted Templeman, & it seems he & Nicolette were an ideal match. If all you have by Nicolette is her compilation CD \"The Very Best of Nicolette Larson\" on Rhino Records and you think it's all you need of her, think again--the only track from \"In the Nick of Time\" included on there is \"Let Me Go, Love\".  Originally released in October of 1979 on Warner Bros., a big thumbs up to Wounded Bird Records for reissuing this highly recommended album on CD in February of 2005--the sound quality on this version is phenomenal.  Wounded Bird commonly releases two-fers, i.e. CDs with two albums on 1 disc; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album \"Nicolette\"--they would EASILY fit on a single CD--but it's still a pleasure to see that they've been re-released, and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain.  For any Nicolette fan, \"In the Nick of Time\" is unquestionably a must-have.",

Surely not a rehash of some old Muddy Waters' and Willie Dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with Muddy's voice and band. This album was a big dud. Sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as Chess Studio in the 1940's and 50's. Unfortunatley Muddy had a better voice and so does Willie Dixon for that matter. All the session men sound like add-ons to the old band, not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing. Pretty weak effort by all, unless Sumlin is himself to blame, as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating,something that had already been created 50 years before.   One redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut, an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session. Sumlin is in need of an editor, or at least a confidant, who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes.",

            "input": "My favorite Bob Dylan album . When Green Day changed up their sound around the mid-90's and came through with a more slickly produced, commercial sound, a lot of their loyal fans didn't like it. But what they seemingly forgot to look at amidst their curious anger is that Green Day's new stuff sounded really good ('Warning' especially), even though, yeah, it sounded quite a bit different.    When it comes to Bob Dylan, die-hard fans compare an album like Empire Burlesque  (and probably a couple before it) with the likes of Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing It All Back Home, and a lot of them not only don't like the change but are agitated with their sneaky hero, though his status as 'constantly-looked-up-to'  remains in tact.    Granted, as much as I like Empire Burlesque, it has to be careful with itself because as it goes from one song to the next you almost feel like you're going to hear this as a soundtrack for a really syrupy Cameron Crowe movie, and that's no good.  But Dylan's sensibilty doesn't go quite that far down the wimpy direction as he remains hard-hearted and overly introspective, even if fairly non-sensical at times.    I love songs like 'Tight Connection to My Heart'   'I'll Remember You'    'Emotionally Yours'   and 'Never Gonna Be The Same Again.' Though the disk sounds slicker than usual, it's a mistake to think the authenticity level dropped at all. If anything, he seems to be connecting with these songs at a higher degree than what is usual with him.    Another great thing about this album is that it's pretty consistent. A couple of the tunes are slighter but none of them are bad and they're all at least a litte above mediocre, with a high portion of it ranging from good to excellent. And that's saying a lot for someone like Dylan, who is so terribly inconsistent. Not long ago I listend to Planet Waves and there are 2-3 outrageously listenable songs there but so much of it is so mediocre.     I've always thought Dylan likes being disliked and that's why he puts out such terrible songs intermingled with all the stuff that's good.  He doesn't want people coming too close and that desire of his seems to draw his fans near all the more.    I saw Dylan in concert last year and he was on keyboards due to some kind of arthritis, or something. There was a guitar planted on the center of the stage and after every song Dylan walked over, with his back hunched over and his shoulders sulking, his white warm-up suit and cowboy hat making him look like a modern-day Texas circus hand. Once there he would walk around the vicinity of the guitar and oftentimes the crowd's screaming would peak, but every time Dylan did not pick up the guitar and instead slowly meandered over to his keyboards. Not once did he pick up the guitar that night but he led the audience to believe he would about 15-20 times. What a tease.     On Empire Burlesque he seems to have softened up and not minded creating something nice all the way through. And those strange actions of his which somehow draw his worshipers ever nigher are absent here, and I'm thankful for that",

            "input": "Two great rarities and lot of crappy remixes . This review has to start with a couple of admissions.  First, I happen to think Cyndi Lauper (especially in her later albums) is an underrated songwriter and performer.  Most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80's and unfortunately dismiss what she's done since then.  Some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs I've ever heard.  On the other hand, I really HATE remixes, especially when they're done solely to try to make \"danceable\" a song that was never intended to be dance music.  So I approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear... excitement that the \"rarities\" would be more of Cyndi's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck, as remixes tend to do.    The two rarities on the album are the songs \"The World is Stone\" and \"You Have to Learn to Live Alone\".  There are also extended versions of \"Mother\" and \"What's Going On\".    \"The World is Stone\" talks about how people are turning to stone, \"cold to the touch and hard on the soul\".  The instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special.  Cyndi's vocals convey the emotional message she's sending exceptionally well, and it's a well-written message about there being \"no warmth anymore\" and \"no love anymore\".  While it may be a \"rarity\" it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs.    \"You Have to Learn to Live Alone\" has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it.  You could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in Casablanca.  Cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music, delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what's a fairly subdued, soft song.  The instrumentals on this song are much better than those for \"The World is Stone\".    The rest of the album consists of remixes, and as I said above, I generally hate remixes.  These are really no exception.  If I had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence, that sentence would be: \"How to turn some decent Cyndi Lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy.\"  If you're into the techno-sounding disco stuff, you might enjoy these, I don't know.  Personally, they ruin some decent songs to me.  The only good thing I can find to say about them is that at least they didn't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like \"Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)\"...      If the entire album was like \"The World is Stone\" and \"You Have to Learn to Live Alone\" I would probably give it something in the 8-10 (out of 10) range.  Those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work.  But the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me, and I can't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4.  If it was an album of just the remixes, it would get maybe a 2, and would only rank that high because Cyndi's voice appears in them",

The other instrumental, \"Take You Out\" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the \"Forever, For Always, For Luther\" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition \"Take You Out.\"  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.

PAUL BOSTAPH IS JUST AS GOOD AS DAVE LOMBARDO YOU F-ING RETARDS!!!!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR F-ING SKULLS.     Sorry, I had to get that out. But seriously, just listen to the crazy intro to Killing Fields, his crazy pummeling in Dittohead, and his double bass madness in SS-3. This is Slayer, quality Slayer, and all the b-chin needs to stop. Im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it, like the retards reviewing Trivium and Unearth. If your like those Sepultura and Anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s, than so be it. Your loss.    As for me, my favorite tracks are Killing Fields, SS-3, Mind Control, 213, and Dittohead.    If my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change, get Diabolus in Musica, this, and God Hates Us All. Also get some of Pauls work with Exodus, Forbidden, and Testament if you need further proof of his excellency",

Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated.  \"Whip-Smart\" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to \"Exile in Guyville\", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought.    Probably the most important thing about \"Whip-Smart\" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from (\"X-Ray Man\", \"Crater Lake\"), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of \"Chopsticks\" to the haunting, moody, \"Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging \"Jealousy\".  Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding.    Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup.  Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete (\"Alice Springs\"), fall apart (\"Support System\", \"Go West\") or are plain irritating (\"Cinco de Mayo\", \"May Queen\").

It's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote.  This is what I appreciate most about the Neo-soul genre; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers.  They are musicians.  (This is what is so frustrating about Brian McKnight, incidentally.  He is a musician, but still refuses to sing in his vocal range.

King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say \"oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling\". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of \"Help the Poor\", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like \"Play it all night!\" and \"Tell it, B.B.!\" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like \"Sweet Little Angel\", \"Worry Worry\", \"How Blue Can You Get\", and \"You Upset Me Baby\". An absolute must-have",

My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word \"pathetic\", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, \"The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope\", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like \"Fire Water Burn\", \"The Bad Touch\", \"Hell Yeah\", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits.  About the \"music\": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do \"best\", and don't try metal. \"Magna Cum Nada\" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop.  The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.    Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?    1. I Hope You Die: See track 15  2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great.  3. Mama's Boy: See track 15  4. Three Point One Four: See track 15  5. Mope: See track 15  6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15    Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. \"1 star , because 0 is not an option\" is exactly correct.    People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.    p.s. Track 15 is called \"This is Stupid.",

            "input": "A hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass . Playing Time - 39:05 -- Don Rigsby doesn't even turn the big 4-0 until February 28 of 2008. Already he has two decades of professional bluegrass experience with such top groups as Longview, Bluegrass Cardinals, J.D. Crowe & the New South, Lonesome River Band and Rock Country. He's also released four highly-acclaimed solo albums and was twice named SPBGMA's male vocalist for the year. When Rock Country disbanded, Don was faced with two choices - work for someone else, or form his own band. He chose the latter and, unlike previous solo albums from Rigsby (on the Sugar Hill label) that enlisted friends and session players, he has recorded \"Hillbilly Heartache\" with his own group (Midnight Call) that includes himself singing lead and playing mandolin, along with Dale Vanderpool (banjo), Shayne Bartley (guitar), Jesse Wells (fiddle), and Robert Maynard (bass). It was a good move to do it all themselves this time because it's a crackerjack band.     In a few instances, (Make God Laugh, Red Bird, Prisoner on the Highway), their vocal arrangements also call for Rigsby to jump up to tenor on the choruses. \"He Loves To Hear You Shout\" (written by Dixie and Tom T. Hall) is a very nicely presented vocal quartet for the group with Rigsby, Vanderpool, Bartley and Wells doing the vocalizing.     While best known for his mandolin picking, Don's a versatile multi-instrumentalist, and it's a treat to hear him also provide some snippets of guitar, mandele, and fiddle. Two songs (\"These Golden Fields\" and \"Any Bar in Birmingham\") incorporate some of Don's light percussion. The former, about farming, features Don's high-lead singing with two harmonies below, as well as Wells' octave violin for a different mood. Obviously, quite a bit of forethought went into producing these songs in the best possible manner for us. In a few, the banjo is muted, and on the closing number, \"I Am The Man, Thomas\") Jesse Wells lays down his fiddle to provide clawhammer banjo as the only accompaniment for Don's voice.     Midnight Call's repertoire is drawn from some excellent songwriters (Shawn Camp, Marty Rabon, Jim Lauderdale, Mark Brinkman, Larry Shell, Kim Williams, Tim Stafford, and others). Bobby Cyrus is a co-writer of \"Big Jim.\" I'm curious as to whether Big Jim is a fictional folkloric character or whether there was actually a man who sacrificed himself for others. You may recall that it was Cyrus who penned the reflective \"Carved Our Names in Stone\" that was sung solo by Rigsby on his last solo album, The Midnight Call. Farmers, family, life and love get ample coverage in the songs. For his song of home, he belts out an inspired rendition of Bill Monroe's \"Kentucky Waltz.\" Another tale from that region is an intoxicating \"Daddy Was A Moonshine Man.\" A standard instrumental, \"Forked Deer\" gallops along, but I hope their future projects introduce us to new tunes. Sung solo, \"Old Green Chevrolet\" relates a tale of a traveling preacher bringing the gospel to mountain folks, and I missed a little harmony on the choruses.     With \"Hillbilly Heartache,\" evocative messages get us thinking, smiling, contemplating, and even laughing when the intoxicating \"Daddy Was A Moonshine Man\" cues up. This Kentuckian clearly has strong mountain roots, and he knows what it takes to produce a very compelling bluegrass album. His reputation and dedication to traditional music, and his innovative vision for the future, are well documented. While he may have stretched boundaries a bit in the past, \"Hillbilly Heartache\" is simply a hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass.

BRUTAL PLANET ... seems too forced ... . \"BRUTAL PLANET\"    REVIEW:     In Alice Cooper's long and successful career (admittedly with ups and downs along the way), he has proved (to me at least) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history. Albums like \"Love It To Death,\" \"Killer,\" \"Billion Dollar Babies,\" and \"Welcome To My Nightmare\" are just simply put - BRILLIANT. Alice was at the top of his game in the 70's. However, that is not to suggest that he's never released worthy material since then. In fact the quite opposite. Albums like his 1983 hidden gem \"Dada,\" 1991's \"Hey Stoopid\" and the brilliant \"The Last Temptation\" (1994) is amongst some of Alice's best work.    However, in the summer of 2000, Alice unleashed BRUTAL PLANET, which was produced by Bob Marlette (Union - \"The Blue Room\") and executive produced by the great Bob Ezrin. While there are standout tracks like the title track, \"Sanctuary,\" and \"Take It Like A Woman\" --- the album just falls flat. The new musical direction (Nu-Metal) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics Alice has ever written.     MUSICIANS:    Ryan Roxie ... Guitars  Phil X ... Guitars  China ... Guitars  Bob Marlette ... Bass  Eric Singer ... Drums    INTERESTING FACTS:    1. Released by Spitfire Records, \"Brutal\" Planet\" peaked at #193 on the Billboard Top 200.    2. There was a Japanese/Australian bonus track called \"Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me\". That title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show \"The Simpsons\".    3. The stage show - which can be seen on the \"Brutally Live\" DVD - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the Frankenstein machine, a Guillotine, two TV`s - and in some cases - three TV's showing weird video footage all through out the show.     PACKAGING:    The album cover - which was created by Kane Roberts' company PlanetFX - is a decent and once again, the booklet does feature  the album's lyrics.    APPROX. RUNNING TIME:    48 min. and 4 sec.    FINAL ANALYSIS:    Musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy. Despite being lyrically well-written, \"Brutal Planet\" is certainly the most disappointing release from Alice since his 1989 album, \"Trash\". **1/2 out of 5.",

Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, \"An Animated Description of Mr. Maps\" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring",

Either you loved it or not,in most cases there was no inbetween. Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys swore to Great Fame as did Bob's steel player Leon. Milton Brown who started it all would of ruled the roost if not for his early death in the late 30's. Spade Cooley was a real favorite even had a TV show and at one time was bigger then them all except he ended up doing time for a murder rap. He was the first to coin the phrase \"Western Swing\". Over the years there were many others like Curly Williams,Tex Williams,Elton Brittand Pee Wee King to name a few.But when I want to hear some of the finest Swing music from who I believe to be the Greastest Western Swing song writer as well as artist there is only one choice,\"Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys\". Hank is about the most under rated Country and Western artist ever to go on the stage. His music is second to none and his lyrics can stop a coon in it's tracks! If you want to really get the best music that Hank ever put out it is essential to get this CD\"Crazy Rhytm\" along with his 2CD set \"King of Hillbilly Bebop\". Both of these sets will open a whole new world of Western Swing to any listener. If you never heard of Hank Penny or heard his music you are in for a treat. His lead female singer was the great Jaye P. Morgan who had great fame in the 50's and 60's as a crooner. I admit that this music is not for everyone and i would bet that only about 10% of todays so called Country Music enthusiasts will apperciate this goldmine of classics. Hits like \"Flamin'Mamie\" and \"Peroxide Blond\" are some of the best \"Hillbilly\" music that will ever be recorded. \"Wide Open Spaces\" and \"Little Red Wagon\" are classics that only Hank could pull off.This is the real thing if your love of music is like mine (my wife has adopted \"Western Swing\"as one of her favorite sounds also). Again please keep in mind if your idea of Country Music is watching some half baked,half naked, B-girl, bimbo on a perverted modern video that they now show on TV singing worthless songs that sound no more Country then Perry Como ,but just like pop hits from the 70's then this classic music ain't for you,believe me it ain't. If your idea of enjoying music is sitting back and listening to Ernest Tubb singing \"I'm like Driftwood on the River of Regret\" then I'm certain you will dig Hank!                               \"Enjoy\" Joe Kopec",

Also, Daniel's drumming on this album is probably his finest hour, a standout for him being Brush the Dust Away.

Although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work, with the exception of BluePrint which is a classic and in a class of its own, I wasn't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general. He should've retired after Blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop. The Black Album was alot better than the BluePrint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90% filler.   While this album shows a more storytelling, poet side of Jay-Z, it ain't exactly his best work. Actually this falls down at the bottom, right beneath his 1997 Vol 1 album. While his maturity as an artist has improved, his lyrical content has suffered. The first 5 songs are classic Jay-Z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of MC such&such. In my opinion, he has faltered quite a bit on this album, this is right under BluePrint2; BluePrint2 should've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic. Kingdom Come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at Lost One, then coming back with Minority Report and ending altogether with Beach Chair, which could've had a better song title given the point of the song. Beyonce, Usher & Ne-Yo, John Legend and Chrisete could've been more utilized than singing hooks, let alone singing hooks on so-so songs. More thought could've been put into the album to make it a 3, and more could've been covered to make it a 4. But Jay is starting to let his Def Jam position affect him.",

But in the end, I feel it is a CD that should be avoided unless you absolutely need everything issued under 2Pac's name.     The sound quality is terrible; it would not rate well if being issued as a bootleg. The CD starts off with a Live Medley, but drops in about the middle of California Love. Even the most idiotic bootlegger would not make such a mistake.    If you decide to continue listening, it is probably because there is a dearth of live material by 2Pac that has found its way to CD. But because of that, why would something of such poor quality be the best for a commercial release?     And at the end of the 40 or so minutes, it becomes obvious...Suge Knight was trying one more time to cash in on 2Pac's legacy before his label became totally insignificant.    The CD does not have the Amaru logo on it, meaning that Afeni Shakur did not approve the release. But Knight's name is written in bold letters anywhere it can fit.    After taking it all in, Knight should have done 2Pac's fans a favor and just made an appeal for donations on the Internet.",

This was his big breakthrough album and it's not hard to see why.  Every single track is excellent, and each very different from what went before.  From start to finish, the emphasis is on simple Beatleish rock arrangements, played with finesse by a great backing band, with the piano front and center.  It starts off with plain rock and roll - Moving Out, with its thumpy rhythm and brilliant ending.  The Stranger (apart from its stylish intro and outro) is a bit more funky, with a lovely bridge/chorus.  The much maligned Just The Way You Are suffers from a bit of cheesiness in production (Billy Joel calls this \"Phil Ramone's Bossa Nova version), but is still a good heartfelt song for his first wife (whatever happened to her anyways?).  The centrepiece of the album is Scenes, this is Billy Joel's tour-de-force to show everyone what he can do on the ivories.  Vienna is a beautiful ballad, and Only the Good Die Young is a hilarious dance tune, still racy 30 years later.  Always a Woman is played a bit stiffly on piano, and borders on cheesy lyrics, but still a great tune.  The next two tracks are a *bit* weaker, but have their moments and are still brilliant songs, just in comparison with what came before...  He came close to topping this album on Glass Houses but this still stands as his finest album.  If you're going to have just one of his albums, I would recommend this.",

I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.    Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.    I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release.

One exception is their remake of Michael W. Smith's 'Pray For Me', which is great.  Others have lyrics that occasionally allude to Christian topics such as, 'I Can't Do This'.  There is one line that says, 'I can't do this.  I can't do this by myself.  Oh God, I need your help.'  In spite of the overall lack of Christian oriented lyrics, which I prefer, there is nothing objectionable about the wording in these songs.    I will likely check out another one of their CDs.

Unless you are easily offended, go see him live. You won't regret it, he interacts with the audience a lot. I picked up this CD at the merch table after his show. Lynch's combination of acoustic guitar and innocently wicked lyrics will leave you in pain from laughing so hard. I like the fact that this was recorded before a live audience, because it captures the experience of seeing him at a show. That's what led me to buy this instead of \"A Little Bit Special\". The audience reaction to the songs on \"Superhero\" adds so much to the album. My personal favorites are:    Dr. Stephen - I love the way you expect him to say a certain word, then he says something completely innocent instead. You have to listen to know what I'm talking about.    Superhero - This song is a good example of the audience interaction at his shows. I like the audience-chosen superheroes, but I probably can't repeat the names here.    What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys - Catchy title for a catchy song. Whether you like the Smashing Pumpkins or not (I do), you will find this short song hilarious. It's a really great impression of Billy Corgan.    Mother's Day - Also very short, but such an unexpected ending.    Taxi Driver - Oh man, I almost p*ssed myself the first time I heard this song! It starts out as a folk song until you hear what the taxi driver said. Totally politically incorrect, but so funny! This is my current favorite track.    Best Friends Song - This duet with Mark Teich starts out friendly and quickly becomes a song about how the one friend wants to nail  the other friend's little sister. Another one you have to hear to appreciate.    I also like the bonus track at the end which contains \"Lullaby (live)\" and \"Special Olympics (live)\". Lullaby is great, and explains to his daughter \"why Mommy left us\". This album is a good place to start if you like dark offensive humor",

This 1973 follow up to the Wailers debut `Catch A Fire' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the Jamaican underground scene for years. `Get Up, Stand Up' and `I Shot The Sheriff' are two of the most hitting cuts the Wailers ever recorded, but the rest of the material doesn't have the same mass appeal of their other albums. This is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience. It's a cool set but `Burnin' isn't an album I can bump too much",

To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.

That said it isn't even close to being as good as Doggystyle, but it is still a good album and after Da Game... and the slightly dissapointing Doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost.    Da Game.... featured No Limit production and loads of appearances by No Limit rappers, and as a result was wack, both have been cut back here.  Snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for No Limit Top Dogg, including of course Dre, for the first time since Doggystyle.  There are also less No Limit rappers (any is too many though) featured, but surprisingly few appearances by his old West Coast homies.  Anyway best track is easily B*tch Please, which is a classic in any era, Snoop's verses are tight but Xzibit is really the star of this track, as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough.  My other top tracks are Buck Em, Just Dippin (both Dre produced unsuprisingly), Betta Days, Down 4 my Nig*az and Trust Me.  Snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on Snoopafella, where he basically re-tells Cinderella from his perspective.  Most of the other tracks are at least good, and the production for the most part is tight, though the album is not without filler (Gangsta Ride, In Love With A Thug).    Overall this is an impressive album from Snoop, yes it is not Doggystyle, I don't think there ever will be another one.  People have the tendency to mark Snoop albums against Doggystyle, rather than on their own merit unfortunately though. I'd give it 4 stars, recommended",

The stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a HUGE VENUE in a small tiny club!  The lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a GREAT one to own!

One reason for their tremendous success  is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from  what year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10  CD's from the R&R era they have launched another 2 special  editions with the same title: one with the special novelty  edition and another with the special country edition.

Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time  ago since these weren't available after the time they were  top hits. I never found them back on what compilation so ever  until ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with a  sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm.

So I thought I'd like this album.  Well, I do like it musically.  It's not great, but it's good trance music.  But the lyrics ruin the album for me.  Most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out.  Here are lyrical samples from the CD:    \"Maybe you're better off without me.\"  \"I'm wide awake, it's time to make it on my own; the dream is over.\"  \"We wanted love to last forever, but something's missing...I can't find words to break your fall, when 'Goodbye' says it all.\"  \"It gets lonely, but I have no other choice...no one sees my dreams falling all apart...I've been blinded by your lies.  I never knew love could be so wrong.\"  \"Tell me why you can't feel the things I do...I made the same mistakes I know I'll make again...It meant nothing to you, you'll never understand, it meant nothing to you, the touch of my hand.\"  \"November's here again, raining down on me, I disappear again...\"  \"It seems like every [scrub?] I see is trying to get it on with me, they think it impresses me, the way they act so foolishly...I don't care, I never liked you anyway...You're a total waste of time.\"    If these lyrics fit your life, and you like trance music, you'll probably like this album.       I do like the remake of A-Ha's \"The Sun Always Shines On TV.\"  It's not better than A-Ha's 8-minute remix version, but it's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor.  This album has three mixes of the song, none of them significantly different from the other.  I also like the instrumental track, \"Blown Away.\" These tracks are enjoyable, and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics, but the album as a whole I find too depressing",

            "input": "Contemplative Goldbergs . Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the \"Goldberg Variations,\" but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental.  Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant \"Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner\" (BWV989).  Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations  - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig.     With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label.  And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series.  Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style.  She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music.  Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording.      Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines.  Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity.  Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance.  Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions.     In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights.  Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful.  But, in the famous 25th \"Black Pearl\" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march.  Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference.  Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit.  But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity.  But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal.  I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night.    Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar \"sweetness\" of style as Hewitt.  As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality).  Many others have also given great performances.    Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings.  ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations).  I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others.  But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations.  The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like.  All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion",

The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)

The newly Christened \"Jacksons\" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, \"The Jacksons\" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with \"Enjoy Yourself\" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic \"Style Of Life\". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that \"Good Times\" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat",

It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.

Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, \"Sacred Love\" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually.

Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.    Truly, there are some great songs on this record.

Queensryche was never a band to sit still-- from their early metal roots on their first couple releases, the band began blending elements of progressive rock and other influences into their sound until \"Promised Land\".  In many ways a pinnacle acheivement in the band's history, it would have been extremely difficult to equal.  The album was well constructed, an acheivement of arranging and sound, and while it was unpopular with a number of the band's fans (who would have preferred a straight metal sound), it was certainly a unique statement.  Many bands would have been tempted to try for a sequel in sound and feel, others would have tried to get even more over the top, still even more would be likely to retreat backwards, to rejoin the metal sounds of their youth.  Queensryche did something quite different.    \"Hear in the Now Frontier\" is a stripped done, bare record.  Gone are the swirling arrangements, the extra instruments, keyboards, synths, samples, layered vocal harmonies, etc.  Instead, straightforward riffing, blistering leads, and a looseness bleed forth, as though the band had been listening to what the other locals in Seattle were doing.  When I first heard the record, I hated it (even as a fan of the grunge movement that in many ways inspired it), but there was enough decent material to keep me coming back to it.    These days I love it.  In truth, I think it represents guitarist Chris DeGarmo's waning interest in metal-- he exited the band shortly after and ended up playing guitar with Jerry Cantrell for a while, and his stamp is all over this-- 12 of the 13 cuts on the record were written or cowritten by him, and the best material (that which looks back as little as possible) was soley from his voice.  From opener \"Sign of the Times\", with its sludgy rhythm guitars and wobbly lead, its clear this is something different.  The best material on the record tends to be the less heavy work-- from the laid back ballad \"Some People Fly\" to swirling love song \"You\" to the brilliant and soporific \"Hero\".  DeGarmo even takes the mic from vocalist Geoff Tate on great love song \"All I Want\", and while some of the heavier and more abstract material also works well (\"Saved\", the bizarre fan-favorite \"sp00L\"), its really an album that excels in the midtempo pieces.    The remaster is further augmented with b-side \"Chasing Blue Sky\" (a relatively uninteresting piece) and three recordings from the MTV unplugged show several years beforehand-- \"Silent Lucidity\" and \"I Will Remember\" get decent readings, but its really \"The Killing Words\" that is noteworthy-- its a fantastic and delicate performance of a great song.    It doesn't sound like old Queensryche, but that's what I love about the band.  They'd reach higher heights, but there's an awful lot of great material on here that deserves listening.  Careful and patient listening will yield rewards",

            "input": "Angela Hewitt at her finest . If you are newer to Bach's abundent solo keyboard music - or Angela Hewitt - then this CD is an excellent place to start. It features the popular \"French Overture\" and contains some of the more lyrical and \"accessible\" music Bach wrote for the keyboard. There is a delightful mix of Bach compositions here capturing the diverse musical styles from Italy, France, Germany and Spain.  Bach shows himself to be a true \"non-politico\" as well as the master composer by skillfully combining these styles (namely from France and Italy) to produce works of great appeal and mastery - but in a style that is uniquely \"Bach.\"    In the opening piece, Hewitt does great justice to Bach's tribute to the Italian concerto style with a convincing \"dialog\" between lighter solo episodes (tutti) and the fuller passages imitating orchestral effect (ritornello) - all on one keyboar of course.  This piece is most famous for the Adagio which Hewitt infuses with much heart and soul by her delicate, thoughtful melodic lines that never approach over sentimentality.  The main event of this CD must certainly be the monumental \"French Overture\" (aka: Partita in B minor) - a grand conception lasting some 30 minutes repleat with numerous movements of French courtly dance influence and rich in imaginative and decorative keyboard effects.  Miss Hewitt wonderfully articulates these effervescent rhythms with supreme confidence and masterful result.  Her ornamentations are always tasteful, seamlessly integrated and truly enthralling to hear.  In the off-beat rhythms of the gigue, her semiquavers bounce off the page with great poise and the crispness of fresh-pressed linen.  And she shows her masterful pianism to its fullest in the curious final \"echo\" movement, bringing an brilliant, orchestral quality to it.    Hiding in the shadows of these two main events are four charming little \"duets.\"  These are no mere \"fillers\" but delightfully catchy, two-part inventions that Hewitt plays to full effect.  Rounding out the program is a most unique \"program music\" piece by Bach thought written around the story of his older brother's departure (\"Capriccio on departure of his brother\").  In it, Angela Hewitt communicates both its nostalgic sentiments with her gentle, poinant phrasing and dynamics along with the piece's festive celebratory ending with her effective creation of trumpet and horn effects.  In this unique composition, Hewitt succeeds to create a wonderful range of emotive effects in one piece.    Indeed, her carefree yet tight-on-the-rails style truly seems to bring out the best of Bach's keyboard treasures - transforming them into music of great vitality and charm.  Her approach to Bach is one of artistry, nuance and good taste (not unlike Schiff) but without the \"directness\" or the \"rough edges\" that can be found in other performer's approaches (Gould and Gulda, respectfully).  The many great Bach performers through the last decades have given us many \"pallates of color\" to experience, and Hewitt's colors are most notably beauty of tone, a poetic flavor, and graceful fluidity of line at its heart.  It is no wonder that Angela Hewitt has been heralded as \"the premier Bach pianist of this generation.\" Just about any recording of Bach's keyboard music by Angela Hewitt is a safe bet for being among the top choices available, and this CD is certainly no exception.  It received the highest marks from both Gramaphone and Penguin Guides while ClassicsToday gave it a perfect 10/10 for Artisty/Sound Quality.  In all her Bach recordings from Hyperion, the sound quality of this recording is among the fullest and most realistically recorded (where some other recordings like her Couperin, WTC or French Suites are done with a touch more \"spaciousness\" but still with clarity).  Also a highlight are the scholarly and detailed notes delineating the nuances of the various \"dance\" types that Bach encorporated into his compositions.  In all, an emmensely satisfying recording from a top Bach pianist of our time.  Highly recommended",

Ultimately, the _Fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises: a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique, but could also realistically (though far-fetched perhaps) fit in with any of the individual artists' other recordings. The bands involved with this volume of _Fishtank_ are Isis and Aereogramme, two bands that have some overlapping qualities, but aren't exactly the same by any means. This is the first and only _Fishtank_ volume I have heard as of yet, but it is apparently a great success on more than one level.    \"Low Tide\" starts with a tender, echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant. The reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of Isis, but the singer of Aereogramme handles the vocals. My first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like Maynard James Keenan's quivering falsetto. Just a bit. Well maybe a bit more than a bit. Either way, they sounded good. The track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea. \"Delial\" gets off to a heavier start, and the hollow vocals of Isis' Turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech.  The third track, \"Stolen\" is more relaxed, with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song, which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects.    The _Fishtank_ concept is a good idea, and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved. For having only two days to produce the songs, I'd say both bands did a great job. I would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this, and for the price, it is another good impulse buy if you're looking for something new. Actually, I recommend getting all three albums in the Isis/Aereogramme trilogy that I have reviewed, along with _In the Absense of Truth_ and _Seclusion_, and listening to them in succession with the _Fishtank_ in their midst. All else aside, this volume has prompted me to seek out the others",

I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series",

I listen to a ton of trance artists in the psychadelic/goa esque genre, and I must say that I have yet to hear anything that can even remotely compare to Infected Mushroom. The originality, detail, and craftsmanship that goes into their music is quite frankly amazing. B.P. Empire is one of many amazing Infected Mushroom albums. Generally it is a bit more ambient, and on some tracks possibly a bit more somber than some of their other realeases, but never the less it is a great album. My personal favorite tracks are Noise Maker and P.G.M.. Dancing With Kadafi is a track which is more of an experimental track, which appears to be the birth of the second disc from Converting Vegetarians (which is an experimental or like IM says, &quot;other side&quot; to Infected Mushroom which is like everything else they do, incredible.). Like all Infected Mushroom albums, the quality of the production of B.P. Empire is among incredible. One of the most amazing aspects of Infected Mushroom is their ability to cleanly mix a multitude of synth and percussion sounds simultaneously and make the mix sound tight and refined, and not like a huge mess. They are quite an amazing group, and at the time are probably my favorite artist in any genre. I also find it amazing how many people that I have showed Infected Mushroom to, that don't even listen to trance, are hooked on Infected Mushroom. I highly suggest that you pick up their albums if you love trance and have an open mind. I promise you will not regret it",

His previous album \"You've come along way baby\" was so good and original but now it seems like he's spending more time on his music videos then on the music, many songs on this Cd are also based on samples from older songs like \"Star 69\" and \"Weapon Of Choice\" and \"Sunset\" some say he's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why don't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of. Norman Cook is a dance artist and there's no way he should try to do something he isn't used to. Bootsy Collins \"Weapons of choise\" and Macy Gray \"Love life\" is Cd, so does the Voice of Jim Morrison on \"Sunset\" but they cannot save this album from fiasco, to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place, it's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here. \"Yo Mama\" got a cool sound though, but he could have tried to do something more with that song. \"Song for shelter\" is dark and slow aswell, think he even released it on single.

Say what you want about Bruce \"getting old\", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame.    All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as \"The River.\"  For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, \"Don't Look Back.\"      And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of \"Born in the U.S.A.\", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string.  For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of \"BITUSA\" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing.    ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the \"staples\" (i.e. \"The Promised Land\") might be dissapointed.  And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term \"to each his own\" is definetely applicable.    Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985?  No.  Is it worth it nonetheless?  Yes",

He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel \"Hey man, this is music\". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.     Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.    But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song \"Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World\".     For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:     She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world  A bad bad girl in a bad bad world  It's not her fault she's a bad bad world  It's so sad it's a sad sad world  She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world  A bad bad girl in a bad bad world  It's not her fault she's a bad bad world  She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl    What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.    Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.     There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until \"Really Rockabilly\" and \"Bad Bad Girl\". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.     I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.    To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape",

I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.     THE CD:  This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: \"Missing\".    THE CONCERT:  The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.    Awesome performances include:  \"Thoughtless\"  \"Breathe No More\"  \"Farther Away\"  \"Bring Me to Life\"  \"Whisper\"    DVD FEATURES:  This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for \"Going Under\", \"Bring Me to Life\", \"Everybody's Fool\", and \"My Immortal\". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of \"Bring Me to Life\" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track \"Missing\". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it",

I am huge Bone fan, they are the group that got me into rap, and i'm into much rap, look at my reviews and you'll see that i am metal head, but i love the bone!!! Layzie and Krayzie are my favorites, followed by Wish and Flesh then Bizzy. I like all of the members, but i love Layzie and Krayzie's delivery and lyrics. So after i finally got around to buying this double disck collektion, i was really amazed at the material on here.    First off, i'll admit that i don't like every track, but i'm a white metal head so what do you expect? but the tracks i do like, i really feel and appreciate them. The moods this album can put me through are really amazing. One minute you can be feeling the fire from heated heavy, where my thugz at, thug alwayz, silent warrior, shoot the club up,world war. Then the next moment you can be feeling some more mellow beats but at the same time it's still cold blooded murda mo going on on tracks like murda mo, try me,thug mentality, these dayz. but there are even more mellow tracks too like Paper, Smokin Budda, That's The Way, won't ez up tonight. This album is really awesome, Krayzie tears up all the tracks, i love how his flow can go from mellow, to angry, to smoothe laid back sounding. Here's all the tracks that i like off this album and a rating for each.    1.Thug Invasion-An excellent intro  2.Heated Heavy-Krayzie's flow is lightining fast and as tight as ever. 10  3.Paper-A nice mellow track, awesome beat that keeps the song interesting. 10  4.Payback Is A Bitch-This song really makes me want to shoot some bitches up!-9  5.Dummy Man-haha, scandolous ass Krayzie! 9  6.Drama-I actaully like this song,it's really true that the b/s never stops. 8  7.World War-tight track-8  When I Die-i actually like this track, no one else seems to agree that is fire! 9  8.Thug Alwayz-Krayzie,Layzie,Flesh, and Wish tear it up! Awesome beat! 10  9.Thug Mentality-I like how he nakes off all the places, nice beat and lyrics. 9  10.Murda Won't Stop-tight ass intro-10  11.Where My Thugz At-Another tight-ass track-9  12.Try Me-i read a lot reviews that said this song was filler, but listen to the lyrics and you'll see why he wrote this song. 9  13.These Dayz-This song has some awesome lyrics and a great beat! listen to all of the versus lyrics! 10  14.Silent Warrior-This song is the fire!!! 10  15.Shoot the Clup up-Love this track! 10  16.Won't Ez Up-9  17.That's The Way-Awesome laid back track-10  18.Murda Mo-Love this track!!

First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. \"Spinning\" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the \"Hang Time\" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called \"sell out\" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!!

Well, somehow I picked up the Rev's first-ever Christmas album even before the two Brians' 2005 holiday discs (the sainted Wilson and the slick Setzer, that is). As Santa said of Rudolph's first jump at the Reindeer Games in that classic Rankin-Bass \"Rudolph\" special, not bad! Not baaaad!  There are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this Christmas stocking, enough to please most of the Whos at your local Whoville. The disc has a chunk of Chuck Berry, and not just the album-closing \"Run Rudolph Run\" (with the Rev, aka guitarist Jim Heath, trading instruments with his bassist, Jimbo Wallace). It actually starts with track 1, the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of \"Frosty the Snowman.\" The credits don't list the pianist, but \"Winter Wonderland\" also has a lot of that Berry/Johnnie Johnson interplay, straight out of \"You Never Can Tell.\" There's also a bit of blazing Berry/Johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places: alongside a mad-mod-surf \"Batman\" swirl on \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.\"  Other yummy flavors in the Rev's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of \"Jingle Bells,\" a Ray Charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of \"Silver Bells,\" a snarky, dirty, bottom-heavy, finger-popping rockabilly swing through \"Rudolph,\" a hoedown of \"Santa on the Roof,\" and an instrumental of \"What Child Is This\" that tosses around country, surf, spaghetti western, even a little bit of Traffic and Hendrix. That's to go along with faithful versions of Elvis' \"Santa Bring My Baby Back\" and Buck Owens' \"Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy.\"  The only soft spot is Heath's voice. The Rev's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups, but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of \"Silver Bells\" and \"Pretty Paper,\" or even \"Santa Bring My Baby Back.\" But hey -- you know what? This album is such a high-spirited affair, and the Rev, Jimbo and Scott Churilla, the drummer, have been such good boys this year, that Santa can overlook that shortcoming. They should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer",

Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).    But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.    Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.    But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound.",

This has always been my favorite John Lennon album because the production is fantastic and the songwriting is ecclectic and creative...    I also believe that this is probably the most consistent post solo-Beatle release because of all fab four post solo recordings, the album's production is flawless...    In 1973, Lennon told Rolling Stone that he had really enjoyed Paul's Band on the Run because he felt it was conceptual... thus, I've entertained the possibility that this album is in part, a response to Band on the Run because it displays conceptualism  and ecclectisism.     Like Band on the Run, Walls and Bridges displays The Beatles' unique ability to go from beautiful lush ballads to rocking rockers... at times, I feel like I'm listening to the White Album....the pentatonic 'Going Down on Love' tracks to the up-tempo, brisk, jazzy 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night'... then, there's the soft Harry Nilson assisted number 'Old Dirt Road'... then John immidiately answers this mellow country song with 'What You Got' (which feels kind of like 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey') and so on ... it has been suggested that John's '#9 Dream' was a subconscious tribute to George... I love this album because I feel that John is in harmony with his other Beatle compatriots  and that he's no longer bitter with his past like he was on Plastic Ono Band..  'Surprise Surprise' with Elton John even has a quotation from a Beatle's song... see if you can guess what it is...!!!    This is the first post Beatles album that really really sounds like something the Beatles would have been truly worthy of producing (unlike Band on the Run that although was a milestone for Paul only sustained mediocre production!!!)    This is also a fun album and along with All Things Must Pass and Tug of War, it stands as the best produced post Beatles recording.. If you're a Beatle's fan but think that there wasn't any good solo Beatle's album.... sit down on a quiet Sunday evening with a friend or two in front of a fire with some hot cocoa, sit back, and enjoy a great album!!",

I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is \"Expressway to yr Skull,\" aka \"Madonna, Sean and Me,\" aka  \"The crucifixion of Sean Penn.\" Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off.   While \"Expressway\" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like \"In the Kingdom #19,\" with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and \"Marilyn Moore,\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as \"Sister\" at first, because many of the songs aren't as \"immediately accessible\" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period. Buy it, it's magical.",

So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation \"i'm your man\" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of \"if it be your will\" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. \"If It be your will\" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. \"mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . .\" or \"i am so very happy, so please hit me\" or \"river of sorrow, don't swallow\" or the breathy way he says the word \"twilight\" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.     Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says \"if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people\". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved \"if it be your will\" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort.",

Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on \"hell on earth\" and \"the infamous\" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace",

Just as the Who fall short, somewhere in between the Beatles, Stones and Led Zep. Daltrey as a great frontman? gimme a break; not worthy of shining the shoes of Jagger or Plant, not even Ozzy (in his prime with Sabbath) or Ian Gillan (Deep Purple). He doesn't even sing on some of their most famous songs, and he didn't write any of them (to go by the liner notes that came with this disc, anyway).  Many of their songs are described as quirky. 'silly' is closer to the mark. How 'bout just 'dumb'?  The Stones declared that 'time was on their side' and marched defiantly in the face of all obstacles, including time itself . The Who promised that they would die before they got old, on the other hand, and failed to deliver.

Well for those of you still trapped in that mindset I invite you to check out \"One\".  Not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music.    I was not aware of Dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were I believe more world/ethno music in nature.  \"One\" is truly a blend of electronic, techno, world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass.  The vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking.    Highlights are the opener \"Waiting For Spring\", \"Close To Us\" & my personal favorite \"A Way To Love\".  Also included and I believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of The Moody Blues \"Nights In White Satin\".

The track kicks off with Susi and Mcgrath going absolutly ape... on their axes and Trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written. The track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns I have ever experienced. Awesome .... Internal War is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from Mike Rudberg. The pace is fast as Susi and Mcgrath lead the way accompenied by Phipps as he belts out words of truth: 'Power in the wrong hands, our scaffold is destroyed, children killing children cuz the government has ignorned, I sling my arrow to shatter your walls, no more creating victims from ignorance'. I loved The Charm, because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something  Shadows Fall may write. Once again gutiars fly all over the place and Trevor sounding like a psychotic madman. This is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad... solos. The last track My Desire also appeared on their full length. I for one do not really dig EPs, but Unearth is one of my favorite bands so I gave em a 5. If you dig any European influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore, Unearth is the band for you, and I for one can not wait for a new full length",

            "input": "Over the shoulder boulder holders . I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.    It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.    In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.    It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.    Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.    The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. \"Over the shoulder boulder holders\" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.    I've heard \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" the same again.    Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.    I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo",

So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).     Ja tries to be \"gangstafied\" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single \"Me & You\" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track \"F*** You\" featuring Vita and 01?    Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song \"Put It On Me\" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song \"Extacy\" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when \"Between Me & You\" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.      Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. \"6 Feet\" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. \"Watching Me\" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. \"I Cry\" and as mentioned earlier \"Extacy\" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.    Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap (\"Put It On Me\" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing.

Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt.

It also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top This may not be the way you like Roxie played, but you shouldn't shun Ann's interpretation.

While this CD lacks \"Wild Horses\", it contains just about every song any fan could wish for.  Hands down, it beats the Life of Surprises compilation with its inclusions of \"Lions in My Own Garden\"  and other material from Swoon, as well as such gems such as \"The Golden Calf\" (a personal favorite of mine) off From Langley Park to Memphis as well as the wonderful \"Bonny\" from Steve McQueen/Two Wheels Good.    I think I could listen to this CD for weeks on end and never tire of such greats as \"Life of Suprises\", \"The Sound Of Crying\", \"Carnival 2000\", \"Appetite\" and so many others.    Yes, you could go buy all the Sprout's stuff (which I recommend highly).  Still, this is a great way to savor one of the most wonderful bands out there.",

This is less a collection of singles with filler as E.J. has been accused of creating later in his career.  Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece.     Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it.  Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack.  He's succeeded with this effort and hasn't looked back since.    If you're a partial E.J. fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work, Madman Across The Water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice",

Here's my review of The Spirit Room.    1. Everywhere- 9/10- A fun and upbeat song. Pretty good, love the intro to it.     2. You Get Me- 5/10- It's pretty, but just too slow to me. Maybe it'll grow on me eventually.     3. All You Wanted- 10/10- The BEST on the album. Love it! Was this a single? If not, it definalty should have been.     4. You Set Me Free- 10/10- Like i already wrote, I got this CD after hearing this song on Ice Princess. Really good and fun to sing to.     5. Something to Sleep To- 7/10- OK. You should listen to it if you want to go to sleep. I still think it's OK.    6. Here With Me- 9/10- Love the beginning and the chorus. It seems like a really good song for a party.    7. Sweet Misery- 6/10- OK also. I just don't really like how the chorus is and it's too short.    8. If Only She Knew- 10/10- Fun and cool. One of my favorites.     9. I'd Rather Be in Love- 7/10- Sounds alot like Sweet Misery.    10. Goodbye to You- 8/10- This is a really pretty song about moving on in life.    11. Drop in the OCean- I don't really get this song. I'm not going to rate it.    Overall, this CD gets an A. It's pretty good. I think you should buy it",

This is a CD I put on after I come back from the pub, or club at night when I've had a few drinks or whatever. Somehow it just calls out to me \"Luke... Luke... PLAY ME\" and I do. It never fails to move me (and sometimes physically). It is a strange, dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by Williams and Holland, with Miles gliding over it like only he can and John McLaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work. It is raw, like most Miles Davis stuff, but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle. Quite unlike any music you will hear these days, bar perhaps Aphex Twin.  When I first got this album I thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power. There is magic in this music, definitely. But, over the years I have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures. Every listen becomes a rich, rewarding experience. It is a real grower, and calmer than most of Miles' other fusion work. It is a good companion to \"A Tribute To Jack Johnson\" (Mainly because of the presence of McLaughlin on guitar), although this album is far less aggressive, and more gentle and mysterious. The album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek, in the middle of the night...",

Other songs are more like party songs and that's why this is recommended for everybody who wants to dance...or likes good music. By the way, what does \"I'm Under the Influence of Love\" means?

The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level",

This is one of those albums that you may dismay as being sub-par, or even bad first listen if you arn't into underground, but you soon relize how this album is a gem. DJ Premeir, and Guru have been putting out classic material sence the late 80's, with there first full album \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\".  Premo is widely regaurded as one of the finest producers to ever grace the boards in hip hop history, and his partner in crime Guru is known as The King Of monotone Rap.    This is artistically a incredible peice of work. Guru & Premo put out a style of Rap that wasnt commen in the 90's, and is non-existant now! A Minimalistic Producer known for playing a melody of three keys, and a obsession for scratching teaming up with a monotone  soft spoken slow tempo rapper. Sound like a weird combonation right? Wrong... If Being a Hip Hop duo was a marrige Gang Starr would have been couple of the year for 10 years straight. This is the type of album you have to spend some time listening to, sure I have my favorite songs of the batch, but they are all solid, and the way Premo mixed together the songs, and even transitions is strokes of genius. Sure you can listen to \"Im the man\" 5 times, but you will get the full effect of \"Im The Man\" in the way Gang Starr men't for you to hear it if you listen to the tracks leading to it.    Everything seems timed perfectly. Strong in your face, phony rapper, and conspiracy theorys come in at the proper time for a full listen thru. The Interludes are also excellently timed. After hearing \"Im The Man\" you want something a little chill, & relax, so Premo follows it up with \"92 Interlude\" a soft short, but sweet 30 second paino riff. And even the intro is a great beat, than instead of it sounding like a new track they programmed it to go immediatly into the next track, cause the beats mix together. Guru lyrically is sharp, and he does not need much help, with only 2 guest appearences, and literally 2 guest appearences, sence premo controlls all the hook's with mastery Guru shows his lyrical powress, consistently spitting 30 plus bars in his monotone serious voice every track, except the interludes. In this album DJ premier seems to be the Architect, and Guru seems to be the foundation. Premier uses his mastery of beatmaking, programming, mixing, scatching, and especially sampling to construct a masterpeice around Guru's lyrics which are the foundation. Bottomline, you gotta pick this up if your a Hip Hop Head",

The synth are a not so in your face version of Children of Bodom, The lead guitar harmonies are a beautiful mixture of Dark Tranquilites fast stacato riffing mixed with the violence and melody of old in Flames. The softer parts alude to my personal favorite 'Insomnium'. This has been the only cd i have been listening to for several weeks now just because there is no reason to listen to anything else.

The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good.

Still good, but you'd think \"oh yeah...\"    Howl is the opposite.  It was OK the first time I listened to it, and I kinda liked it, but it didnt really dig it's claws into me.  For that reason it didn't get pulled out of the CD wallet all that often.  Then I put it in one day and thought \"ya know, this is actually pretty good.\"   Then I started listening to it some more and thought \"man, this is really, really good!\"  Guess what?  Now I love it...  This is definitely a creeper CD, as in - it creeps up on you (yeah, that was a stoner analogy.)      I think \"weight of the world\" is the best song on the CD, but \"howl\" had really grown on me too - but I don't want to harp on the songs too much, this is an album as a whole.  Bands grow up and change, and I'm glad to see that BRMC has done it, and done it well.  They haven't lost their muse or gotten \"softer\" just to try something different -- they've grown and changed and their music shows it.  I remember my freshman year in college when Achtung Baby came out and there were people saying stuff like \"boycott U2 cuz they're sellouts!\" - not realizing that AB would be looked at as probably the most insightful, clever, and musically interesting album of their catalog.  That's what the backlash to Howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate.      Yeah, people may fear change, and admittedly, some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process (Chris Gaines, anyone...) but BRMC has actually grown, and if you liked their first 2 CD's I'd say give this one a shot.  It's really good - and I'm proud of 'em for making it.",

Let me list the reasons why you should not buy this travesty of an album (even the word \"album\" is used loosely - at best, this collection resembles a group of theme songs from various C-Grade Telenovela series):    1. THE VOICE :    There is no voice. Granted, JLO was never known for her vocal ability, but having taken vocal lessons and practice from husband Marc Antony, one would think she would sound better, but NO. If anything, Jennifers' weak voice is showcased as being even more weak as she literally whines her way through over an hour of the most godawful caterwauling ever heard this side of the Nanjing Massacre.    2. THE MUSIC :    There is no music. The first single \"Que Hiciste\" has some Spanish sounding instruments thrown in for that \"authentic Mexican experience\" (yeah, right), but from then on out, its one disgusting ballad after the other. There is no melody, and at one point, I was wishing that SOME poor B-side from her \"On the 6\" album would pop up to put me out of my misery. Let it be clear - the music on this is non-existent, and Im not just saying that for effect.    3. THE ACCENT:    JLO is not a genuine native Spanish speaker, but she has definitely worked on her accent. However, its a bit sad when Beyonce's new Spanish version of \"Irreplaceable\" sounds more authentic than anything on this godforsaken CD. Jennifer sounds very forced and gimmicky here, enunciating her Rs and Ts with gusto and a very misplaced conviction. The efforts only lead to what one can call an overwhelming sense of underwhelmingness (the term has come into existence upon the release of this CD)    Jennifer, what went wrong? You had the best producers (though, when you think of it, Marc Antony's only claim to fame in the US is his horrendous \"You Sang to Me\") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable.    More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed.    True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release.    'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment.    Vaya con dios, JL",

To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what \"A Hard Days' Night\" did for the Beatles.

She is a really good singer, and that's really good for a girl at such a young age. The first song I ever heard by her was \"Leave (get out)\" and I liked it a little bit then, but now I really like it! She may be a little too young to sing what she sings about, but the songs are still really good! Well, here it is:    1. Breezy - 10/10 A really interesting and creative beginning to the album! She uses loud vocals in this song, too, which makes it stand out a lot.    2. Baby it's you - 10/10 A great single! This song is very sweet, and is pretty easy to understand in some parts.    3. Not that kinda girl - 10/10 This is one of her latest singles on her CD, and it's a very nice song! In this song she basically talks about what she is and what she isn't, and I really like music that does that sort of stuff.    4. The happy song - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. The tune is a little too orignal in my opinion, but the lyrics are pretty good.    5. Homeboy - 10/10 Great song, although I never really liked the word \"homeboy\". But, the tune is very familiar and very pretty.    6. City lights - 7.5/10 This one isn't that great, particularly because of the guys that come up some point in this song and start to rap. It just sounds a little werid, and I never liked rap.    7. Leave (Get out) - 10/10 Awesome single! It's one of the only songs on here that stands out, and it's great to dance to! The music video is pretty cool too, check it out!    8. Use my shoulder - 7/10 Ok, I think she could've picked a better chorus tune than this one, cuz this one was just annoying and boring. But as always, the lyrics are good.    9. Never say goodbye - 10/10 Beautiful! This tune is VERY familiar! It sounds to me like she did a remake of it or something, cuz it's got a beautiful tune and beautiful lyrics. This song can also be used as a lullaby to put someone to sleep. :-P    10. Weak - 6/10 UGH! This song is just soooooooo long and boring! Although the lyrics are always good, this song is just too original.    11. Keep on Keepin' on - 9/10 This is the first song on this ablum that's written by JoJo herself! She did a great job on it, too. The lyrics are just so true!    12. Sunshine - 9/10 Another song that she wrote, and it's just as good. I like the tune also, it's very nice.    13. Yes or no - 9/10 This is a good one too, and another one that she wrote (along with others, of course). I really like the beginning, it's one of those beginnings you would'nt expect in a song lol.    14. Fairy Tales - 7/10 I guess this is a nice ending, but the song itself isn't too great. I'm sure she could've made a better tune than this boring one. I'm into pop and energetic music, not usually slow songs like this!    Overall, cool CD. If you've heard any of JoJo's music, I'm sure you'd like her album. Also, keep and eye out for her new album titled \"The high road\" coming out on October 17th! I can't wait to get it myself, especially after hearing her cool new song, \"Too little too late\"",

An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first",

Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track \"Cold\" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be \"Cold\", \"Starless\", \"Colors\", and \"Dead Skin\". Here's the track ratings...    1. Starless - 9.5/10   2. Cold - 10/10   3. So Far Away - 9.5/10   4. Colors - 10/10   5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10    6. The Deep End - 9/10  7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10  8. Dead Skin - 10/10  9. Disco - 7/10   10. The Unknown - 9/10    Overall: 93% A-    Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection.",

            "input": "Some really curious musical choices hamstring this recording. . There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.    Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.    Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!    Why are the vocals so \"hot\"?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.    Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.    Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.    Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast",

            "input": "My personal favorite Pixies release . It seems like when it comes to the Pixies, the talk is generally \"Surfer Rosa this\" and \"Doolittle that,\" and while those are certainly good albums I've never figured out why Bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors.  With the exception of Trompe Le Monde (which I plan on getting around to eventually, I swear) I've heard pretty much the Pixies' whole output, and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often.  Bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the Pixies' earlier career down just a bit, but in their place is a more arty, spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band's already wide-ranging sound.  Sure, there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of Broken Face or Tame, but for track-by-track excellence and diversity Bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top.      After the blistering, hard-rocking instrumental opener Cecilia Ann sets the tone, Bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the 90's wouldn't even dream of.  With Black Francis screaming his head off at full volume, the angry, assaultive Rock Music sounds like Debaser on steroids, but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums.  Songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions, making Bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors, but it's one more than worth acquiring.  This album represents the Pixies' peak as musicians (at least to that point); the rawer edges from Surfer Rosa and Doolittle had definitely been toned down, but those albums didn't contain anything quite like the complex, Talking Heads-like rhythms of Dig For Fire or the dense, proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of Down to the Well.  The Pixies' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here: just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.      All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.  And is that a falsetto Black Francis is doing with his voice?  Well, yeah, most of the time, but it works perfectly for the song's trippy, drug-like feel.  Even when they're plowing ahead at full speed, as on Allison and Hang Wire, the band's more tuneful, surf-rock direction is apparent, but it's even more evident on pleasant, literally pacific tracks like Ana and the closing Havalina.      My enduring favorite from this album, though, would have to be Happening.  It doesn't start off all that unusually for a Pixies song, with Black Francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs, but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented, with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix, culminating in Black Francis's stream-of-consciousness, half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out.  It's a total classic, just like this album, and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something",

            "input": "Live fast, die young, stay pretty....... . Like so many of the albums I now find myself trawling for, my first copy of The Slider was on good old 12\" vinyl. In that original incarnation it only included the first 13 tracks now included on the CD release. \"Thunderwing\" and \"Lady\" were, if memory serves me, first aired on the B-side of the \"Metal Guru\" single, while \"Cadillac\" (the great single-that-never-was in my opinion) never really seemd to find a home it was happy with. In feel it probably belongs with the sparser-sounding \"Zip Gun\" than with the lusher \"Slider\" or \"Tanx\" production. Purists may argue that \"Electric Warrior\" is the T.Rex album to own if you're only going to have the one, but it is essentially a transitional album bridging the gap between the earlier Tolkienesque folk period and the Glam that followed and ends up being neither one thing nor t'other. \"Slider\" lies firmly in the latter period and is as good an example of the strengths and weaknesses of Marc Bolan as writer and performer as you are likely to get. I can think of nobody else in the modern period who has been able to extract such a variety of results from the basic three-chord blues riff. It's a well documented fact that Bolan would have loved to be Elvis, and on the strength of this perhaps he wouldn't have made a bad job of it. It's too easy to treat some of the lyrics harshly, branding them \"pretentious\" or \"unintelligeable\", (although if it were early 20th century poetry it would be called \"hermetic\" and treated with reverence), but that's what Bolan was all about from first to last. T.Rex are probably pretty much of an unknown quantity to most American listeners outside of \"Get It on\" (with it's title inexplicably censored for transatlantic consumption). Here in Britain for 3 or so all too brief years he was the epitome of a pop star. \"Slider\" more than any other album illustrates what he was about before succumbing to McCartney's Syndrome and putting the wife on keyboards",

Hello there people looking into buying THUG LIFE VOLUME 1.    i would first like to start with a little information on THUG LIFE which was the name of a rap group which featured 2pac, big syke, mopreme and a few other's. if you are a 2pac fan you may of already heard of this album although this album is one of 2pacs most unrecornised albums and when 2pac founded the group in 1993 they where quite unknown to the public and it was only after 2pac was shoot when people noticed the album.     the THUG LIFE group may better today be known as the OUTLAWZ with big syke changing his name to MUSSILINI on the outlawz albums 2pac to MAKAVELI, MOPREME did not stay with the group when they changed there names to the OUTLAWZ which was a shame due to the fact MOPREME was one of the better rappers on the THUG LIFE album, he was also the son of the late MUTULU shakur which was 2pacs stepfather. mutulu is mentioned alot in 2pacs older albums due to the fact mutulu was there for tupac and tupac saw him as a father figure,   even though mutulu was placed on the FBI's MOST WANTED LIST after escaping from prison in the 80's tupac looked up to him.     the name THUG LIFE is a name 2pac called the group with the meaning : The Hate U Gave Little Infants F**k Every1 which spells out thug life if you use the first letter in every word.    the notoious B.I.G was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label desided against it and removed b.i.g    * THE ALBUM *  This is a old classic album and fans of tupac would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd rack, due to tupacs death the rise of price's to shakurs albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $15 and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap.    if your a fan of ALL EYEZ ON ME and alot of tupacs latier stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy, tupac is often well know for his poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk's about diffrent topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic ie: tear drops and close caskets    there seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is diffrent to shakurs newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album, ( i didn't leave this album to be the last one to buy till i finished my pac collection, i think it was the 3rd i bought )    there are some brilliant songs on this album, songs like HOW LONG WILL YOU MORN ME in memory for kado (R.I.P) Which also D.M.X. does a memorial for KADO at the end of WHERE THE HOOD AT vidoe    even if you buy the album for HOW LONG WILL THEY MORN ME it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by NATE DOGG, there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums. plent of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it, also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to sing along with (we all like a good sing along) i would recomend this album to first time buyer's and defo to old 2pac fans who havn't got it yet.      thank you for taking the time to read my review, i hoped it help you in your choice. please feel free to leave coments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on \"see all reviews\" button next to my name",

But with all due respect to Mr. Jones, let's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the CD they are thinking about buying.  Recorded in July 1962, six months after a successful and impressionable tour of Japan, \"The Tokyo Blues\" is Silver's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the Pacific.  Each of the disc's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of Japanese culture or tradition.  But don't think Silver went so far as to incorporate Japanese music on this album, for this is classic hard bop from one of the master's of the genre.  The band here is the famous Quintet of 1959-63 (Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Junior Cook on tenor sax, Gene Taylor on bass) with one exception -- John Harris Jr. replaces Roy Brooks on drums, who was ill at the time of this session.  While \"The Tokyo Blues\" may not quite live up to \"Song For My Father,\" it is as good as anything else this quintet cut, including \"Silver's Serenade,\" \"Finger Poppin\" and \"Blowin' The Blues Away.",

Chris Whitley has always been a favorite of mine, ever since the stunning debut of \"Living With the Law\".  I saw Chris on tour supporting that album in Seattle, on a double bill with Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The auditorium was packed with young Seattle suburbanites to see Toad, then when Chris took stage, half the place emptied out.  The faithful, knowing remainders witnessed a typical Chris show; searing, passionate, but also flawed and overly amplified.  Chris chain-smoked the entire show, and said little to the audience, but when I left I knew I'd seen an artist with no peer.    \"Reiter In\" is an amazing cd-probably for the first time, Chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians.  Although unpolished and recorded to analog, the band is cohesive, lending a jukejoint feel to Chris' guitar playing.  This music doesn't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it's got elements of Led Zeppelin/The Black Keys/\"Achtung Baby\" U2, with some Depression era blues tossed in between.  Rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges, Chris gave us sweaty, soulful, life-affirming music, a most fitting end-note",

The combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you don't feel burnt out by one or the other.  One of the cooler parts about the first CD is tracks such as Under the Sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels.  There is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system.  Normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels, but a few songs selected by Armin goes against this trend.  These days there is a lot of good electronic music out there, but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment.  All the songs Armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous.    The second CD is 3 stars.  It doesn't have the energy and momentum that CD1 has and there aren't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats.  Armin could probably have introduced more variety into CD2 such as breakbeat, house, and tribal, but it is what it is.",

            "input": "Incubus' most Unique Album . \"Morning View\" in my opinion is the most different album by Incubus.  Their traditional sound lies within rock, hard rock, etc.  But this album is the one with the most chilled-out songs on it.  That is one of the reasons for this being my favorite Incubus album: its originality.      Mind you...if you like this album, don't attain the mindset of \"omg if I like this one I'll like their other albums too!\"  It doesn't work that way; Incubus' other releases are nothing like this, with the exception of a few songs.  And now...let's move on to the song review.    Nice to Know You--A nice opening song.  I like the lyrics a lot, and the constant transission between heavy rock and slow beats gives the song a good rhythm.  8.5/10    Circles--Probably the one song on \"Morning View\" that is most like Incubus' other albums.  The guitar in the background is especially cool.  The chorus is also nice, and the lyrics really stay true to the song title.  8/10    Wish You Were Here--My favorite song on this CD by far.  The guitar riffs in this song are the greatest on the whole album.  The chorus is also very amazing, and so are the lyrics.  Quite possibly a perfect song.  10/10    Just a Phase--Probably the song with the mose meaningful lyrics on the album.  It starts off as an easy-going song with no lyrics and a catchy, steady beat and then is joined by powerful lyrics that have to do with going through a typical phase and how annoying it is to go through something like that.  9/10    11 A.M.--A song with a mixture of Incubus' rock and the slow beats on this CD.  This track acts as a bridge between the other albums and this album, in my opinion.  8.5/10    Blood on the Ground--Like Circles, this track is like Incubus' songs from other albums.  Not only that, but this song's lyrics are meaningful as well.  It portrays getting in fights, but not saying anything to the other person (hence \"Blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground\").  8/10    Mexico--The slowest song on here by far.  This is such a big step for incubus, because as far as I can tell, they have never done anything like this before.  This is why they are such an excellent band: they take risks by exploring other genres, and they do a good job at it too.  8.5/10    Warning--My second favorite track on the whole album.  I dunno why, but it is excellent.  The vocals and lyrics are the best here.  Especially the nice-sounding bit in which the vocals go \"We'll make millions writing a book on the way it should have been.\"  Parts of this song like this one portray a great range in the vocals, which is why this is such a great song.  9.5/10    Echo--My favorite slow song.  The vocals sound very nice, especially the chorus.  The chorus alone is a reason to listen to this track over and over again.  9/10    Have you Ever--Not one of my personal favorites, but still a good track.  It resembles a lot of other Incubus songs on the other albums as well.  This song is basically about putting yourself in someone else's position before you judge them.  8/10    Are You In?--The most  pop-like song on the album.  I was surprised and happy to hear this song.  Again: Incubus is awesome at experimenting with new songs, and I must say, this one came out nicely.  9/10    Under my Umbrella--Also a lot like their other songs on albums such as \"Make Yourself.\"  But the beginning vocals (\"When I close my eyes...\") sound awesome, and so does the main singing.  Overall, a good track.  8.5/10    Aqueous Transmission--The most UNIQUE song ever done by Incubus EVER.  It includes instruments they've never used before, such as a Japanese flute.  It has a \"Crouching-Tiger, Hidden-Dragon\" feel to it, and it is enjoyable even for the sole reason that it is different from the rest of the songs.  The vocals are also great.  9/10    OVERALL score: 5 stars.  This is definitely the most unique, most laid-back album by Incubus.  It shows a lot of very successful experimentation as well.  I dunno what all this \"selling out\" talk is, but you should definitely buy this album.  It is much different from the other albums, and still manages to be one of Incubus' best albums",

The two standout tracks are 'I Got  Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated  honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable  You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge  him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and  it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure",

I've just gotten hip to the Hotel Costes series by Stephane Pompougnac (so I'm 4 years behind with this review--please, bare with me!)...I'm one of those people who don't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff--at any rate, I started buying this series outta order...I bought #5 first, #4 was too latin for me to purchase, #1 too expensive, and #3 was unavailable...soo, I decided on &quot;La Suite&quot; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it. Well, some of them anyway. The ubiquitous &quot;Jazz Music&quot; by De-Phazz almost made me not buy this set, but I said, what the hell? It won't be the first time I bought a mix/comp CD with songs I've already seen or heard a million times already. How does that work anyway? What? Certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something? ahem...As usual,I digress.  All that notwithstanding, &quot;La Suite&quot; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house, as I so aptly pen music such as that remixed by Pompougnac. This whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy 1, 3 and 4 no matter the cost.  Hey--I'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series, what can I say? Anyway, getting back to the review of &quot;La Suite&quot;, it's not as good as #5 (or from what I could sample on #1 in Borders), but it does have some stellar moments with the opening &quot;To Ulrike M.&quot; by Doris Days with a Zero 7 remix?? OK, Pompougnac, what gives? I thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you?  Other stand out tracks are from 45 Dip (Check these guys out on the &quot;Acid Lounge in Space&quot; Comp CD), Sympatique (Now, this is true Parisian music despite it's &quot;cheesiness&quot; as one reviewer stated), Mo'Horizons (nice, as always), Palais Mascotte (strong dance floor appeal), I:Cube (hypnotic with a 60s feel), Pascal w/Mister Day (nice disco-track), Mr. Scruff (the song says it all), Boozoo Bajou (nocturanal) and Streetlife (cinematic and groovy, baby). This is a worthy investment for any Chill/House music fan.  The songs on Costes &quot;La Suite&quot; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end. Sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together--you know the ones, they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of Corona trying desperately to look cool",

I saw the second half of their set, all the time wondering  &quot;who are these guys?&quot; Then they announced that they were  Galactic.

This band reminds me very much of a jazz trio  called Medeski, Martin, and Wood. However, Galactic offers great singing  and horns giving them a much more diverse sound.

Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. \"Naked\", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.    I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!    I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song \"All Because Of You\", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, \"Naked\" & \"Sex Wit You\" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.    Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide.

Many of the acts typically credited with bringing alternative music to the mainstream have, for better or worse, been little more than angry pop acts (Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails being prominent examples), and even many more underground acts such as Pixies, Sonic Youth, and the Jesus Lizard released some material that was palatable to the mainstream, as their major-label runs attest.  Big Black, on the other hand, was the real deal, a band that lived out the indie philosophy in both their music and in their resolutely do-it-yourself business practices, and paid the commercial price for it.  Songs About F***ing was the perfect distillation of leader Steve Albini's philosophy: an abrasive, confrontational album that contained no concessions to the mainstream and no pretensions to socially redeeming value.  This is music at its most twisted and evil, acknowledging no taboos as it challenged listeners to take or leave its assaultive sound and unpleasant lyrical content.      The key to the lasting appeal of this release lies largely in its simplicity.  Like fellow pioneering noise-merchants Godflesh, Big Black distilled rock music to its most basic elements: guitar, bass, and drum machine.  In spite of this minimal approach, however, Songs About F***ing is hardly palatable or unchallenging.  What emerges from this combination of rock's traditional elements is a barrage of scathing, disembowling noise that pummels eardrums with a mix of astringent guitar squalls and pulsating industrial beasts.  And of course, it's all topped off with the demented vocal stylings of Albini himself, making Kurt Cobain sound like Mel Torme as he howled and screamed his tales of depravity.      Mixing metal, punk, and the then-burgeoning genre of industrial with reckless abandon, Songs About F***ing constitutes a musical roller coaster of frightening proportions, and wraps things up in barely half an hour.  The basslines and drum programming of Bad Penny and Colombian Necktie are enough to crack skulls, while Albini's vocals legitimately bring to mind a man in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  L-Dopa is all punkish speed and aggression but infinitely more frightening, and the proto-industrial rage of Precious Thing and Kasimir N. Pulaski Day would send Trent Reznor up a tree.  Even when the band slows down, as on Kitty Empire, the results are clenched, sinister, and intense.  Tiny, King of the Jews (love that title) actually manages to be somewhat atmospheric, but it still relies heavily on that mix of disconcerting guitar noise and pulsating beats.    I've listened to pretty much every noted act in the extreme-music world, from Slayer to Godflesh to Meshuggah, and Big Black may have been the scariest of all.  And Songs about F***ing in an unqualified triumph, one that oozes menace and integrity at the same time.  Own it, or pose",

I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so",

In many ways a relic of its era, \"Not of This Earth\" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of \"Time Machine\", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.    The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.    The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces (\"Not of This Earth\", \"Hordes of Locusts\") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple (\"The Snake\", \"Driving At Night\") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely \"Rubina\", reggaeish and emotionally soaked \"Memories\", and the overtly Frippesque \"New Day\" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably \"Brother John\", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.    In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with \"Surfing With the Alien\"",

On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart.

            "input": "Impressive and Affordable . The debate over the performance of J.S. Bach's cantatas boils down to the  following: the evidence suggests that Bach only had one singer per part for  performances of his cantatas. Thus, any historically accurate performance  of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach. At the same  time, however, there is additional evidence that Bach wanted more  performers. We are thus stuck with deciding whether Bach wrote for the  musical forces he had on hand (which seems logical enough) or whether he  composed for the performers he would like to have (which would seem silly,  if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions.  On the other hand, Bach does make &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;tutti&quot;  distinctions in the score... draw your own conclusions).  Rifken is a  strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach, which may seem a  little sparse at first. Yet, when one listens to the various cantatas on  these disks, one must confess that these sound, well, beautiful. This may  not be an approach which would work for all of Bach's works, but the  effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity.  Regardless of where you fall-- and if you fall-- in the strenuous debates  over historical performance, I would heartily recommend this disk. Not only  are the performances polished, but the works themselves are exquisite-- a  wonderful sampling of Bach's cantatas. (Personally I am addicted to the  duet, &quot;Wir eilen mit schwachen, doch emsigen Schritten&quot; from BWV  74 which I could gladly listen to over and over-- listen to it and you will  see why.",

I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums.  The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves",

This stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art'.     But honest injun, I only review albums that I actually own and since I've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - I paid for it and still own it.    The airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating. My list of major problems with this release is;    1 - A band called Danger Danger puts out an album with the lead track of Naughty Naughty. The saving grace is that Naughty Naughty is a darn fine song. Really, the genre doesn't get much better than this. Pity about the rest of this album.  2 - This is the kind of band that Metal Edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'The Way the Were' which actually had photos of the band members as kids. Really, pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward. Then again, at the time D/D made a bit of cash so perhaps they're the ones laughing now.  3 - \"Bang Bang - what's that sound / I gave you my heart then you shot me down\"    If Naughty Naughty was the genre at it's best then tunes like Bang Bang were the genre at it's most dire.    I have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time. Despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star, I can't possibly do it. These guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you wouldn't want to hurt their feelings. Not to mention the fact that Saturday Nite also rocks well. Two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just don't rate so it can't get more than two stars",

I believe that Zakk Wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time. If you are a first time Black Label listener, however, I would not reccomend this CD. In order to fully appreciate Black Label Society, you need to start off with Sonic Brew, or Stronger Than Death. Some good songs on those CD's are: Bored To Tears, Lowdown, Beneath the Tree, 13 Years of Grief, and Love Reign Down.",

Wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously haven't heard THIS trash.      Sheesh, where do I even begin?  You thought Fiddy was bad?  How about Chingy?  Lil Jon?  Nope, they're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh.  These guys are a disgrace to the black race, Aaron McGruder is totally right (creator of the Boondocks) if Martin Luther King Jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of Black America, perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point.  Afterall it was Chris rock that said, \"There are black people and there's n***ers!\"  Then everyone in the audience laughed their *sses off because it's true.  Unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group.    Don't give me that rubbish on how it's just the music, no way folks, this goes far beyond the music itself.  This is a reflection of the sad state our society is in.  Ok people you want to talk about the actual MUSIC?  We shall then, but these cliched annoying 'beats'  lack so much substance that I'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music'.  The lyrics?  They bring new meaning to the word STUPID.    So there you have it, this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them (the aforementioned rap degenerates) they really take the cake for Retards of the Decade when we talk about \"I Love the '00s\" in 10 years.

            "input": "Fully developed Canterbury sound . This excellent 1975 album shows Hatfield & the North adopting a full blown Canterbury rock sound - a nice mixture of quirky prog and jazz rock.  Although folks refer to a Canterbury style before 1975 (I include myself here too), the bands lumped under the Canterbury style pre-1975 were incredibly disparate and utilized a broad spectrum of musical styles.  The Henry Cow (experimental) - Caravan (pop prog) continuum comes to mind in fact.  It was not until the mid-1970s however, that a distinct Canterbury sound emerged (quirky, proggy, jazz rock) and this album is a superb example.    The core lineup includes a virtual who's who of Canterbury rock: Phil Miller (guitars); drummer Pip Pyle; Richard Sinclair (vocals, bass guitar); and Dave Stewart (Hammond organ, electric piano, tone generator.  The additional musicians are also among the Canterbury luminaries and include Jimmy Hastings (flute, soparano and tenor saxophone); Mont Campbell (French horn); Lindsay Cooper (oboe and bassoon); Tim Hodgkinson (clarinet), and finally the Northettes (Barbara Gaskin, Amanda Parsons, and Ann Rosenthal).  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and the individual performances are breathtaking.  The ensemble work is also very intricate and there are some fairly dexterous meter shifts.  I feel that Richard Sinclair's vocals (and bass playing) are both excellent and it is always a treat to hear him perform whether with Caravan, Hatfield & the North, or Camel.    The nine tracks on the album are arranged into two largish suites, including tracks 1-8 and the massive 20'13 Mumps suite.  As I mentioned, although progressive rock is the dominant style, there is a good bit of jazz rock.  In fact, there may be slightly more jazz rock than was found on the 1974 debut.  There is also the whimsical Canterburian sense of humor - I think this is also a distinctive feature of the Canterbury \"thing\".  Greater emphasis is placed on instrumental sections and lengthy \"jams\" are scattered across the album, where Dave and Phil really get a chance to shine.  The Northettes also add a very nice, dreamy touch to each piece, and the woodwind playing, (especially Jimmy's flute work), heighten this effect.  There are also brief experimental sections too - the last few minutes of Fitter Stoke has a Bath is a good example of this.  Overall, although I don't feel that Rotter's Club is much different than the debut, some folks might notice a bit of more of a jazz rock approach.      The bonus tracks include alternate takes of Big John Wayne Socks Psychology on the Jaw and Chaos at the Greasy Spoon, in addition to the extremely jazzy track Halfway between Heaven and Earth, the thunderous (it is unbelievably heavy) Oh, Len's Nature!, and the once again very jazz-rocky Lying and Gracing (it sounds live but there is no indication of where it was recorded).  These last three tracks are superb.    All in all, this is an excellent Hatfield & the North album and is highly recommended along with the 1973 debut",

On tracks such as \"Live By The Gun\" and \"Homicide,\" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for \"harder\" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between.

With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.    1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album \"Armenia in the Sky\". The outstanding single \"I Can See For Miles\" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.     The acoustic \"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.    Songs like \"Odorono\" and \"Tattoo\" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.     \"Our Love Was\" and \"I Can't Reach\" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album \"A Quick One\".     I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.     Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic \"Sunrise\" is quite beautiful, but \"Rael\" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.    Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.     Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals.",

Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said \"listen to this music in the opening credits Riley\".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.    What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a \"dark superhero theme\", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation.  What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion.  cheers  K",

After the high standard set by \"Further Down the Spiral\", I had lofty expectations, and that could be effecting my opinion of this one, I largely found that this album falls short of its predecessor in all ways.    It could be the choice of material-- largely sticking to the song forms, I think the remixers missed an opportunity to really place with something atmospheric and create something unique-- I mean, did we really need three versions of \"Starf***ers, Inc\"?  I find the original to be subpar, and remixing a weak song isn't going to produce a strong one, regardless of the efforts Sherwood, Oglivie, and Clouser put into their remixes.  Ditto for Hillibrandt's take on \"The Wretched\"-- its not one of the stronger pieces on the record.  And where's the remixes of \"We're In This Together\" or instrumentals like \"Just Like You Imagined\" or \"Complication\"?  This material has a depth and detail to it that suggest it could well receive a remix.    Now mind you, its not all bad on here, Reznor and Moulder's reconstruction, \"The Great Collapse\" (pulling in samples from at least a couple songs and layering them on top of a good beat) is very listenable, Benelli's remix of \"The Frail\" as a string piece may surpass the original in terms of delicate beauty, and the cover of Gary Numan's \"Metal\" is fantastic.

First, most songs seemed half-baked, with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly.  These are short songs, devoid of development and any compositional reach.  Second, the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time.  Overdone in the all-star backing musicians (Danny Kortchmar! Leland Sklar!  Nigel Olsson!  Burton Cummings!  Jeff Porcaro!) playing very simple stuff.  Overdone in the too-thick orchestration.  Timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on \"Hey Deanie\" and other examples throughout the album.  Finally, I was surprised by the brevity.  Only 8 tunes, with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track.  Again, underlining the overall theme of an uninspired, tired work",

The band says it has given up trying to \"define\" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: \"Block of Wood\" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while \"International Airport\" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.    The songs range from engaging (\"Bright Lights,\" \"Love Loss Hope Repeat\") to anthemic (\"Learn to Fly,\" \"Comfort\") to heartbreaking (\"Block of Wood\") to humorous (\"A Girl and Her Horse\") to profound (\"The War Was in Color\"). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.     There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.    This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with \"Ganging Up on the Sun\" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with \"Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat.",

I'm not one who slags the whole genre off upon the discovery of other music like progressive rock and other styles like a lot of people do. When I first came across the genre years ago, I was in heaven. There were a lot of really cool albums by bands like Stratovarius, Labyrinth, Dream Evil, Blind Guardian, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, and others that brought forth the nostalgic sounds of some of my favorite 80s metal bands, though with the benefit of modern production technology. Sure, the subject matter among many of these bands can come across as goofy (almost bearing a Manowar quality at times), but most people seem to miss the point that none of it is meant to be taken seriously.    Of course, my interest in Power Metal has waned since then, but only because after a while, most of the bands I came across started to sound a lot alike with very little to separate them apart from others and make me want to come back for more. It seemed like all the bands had the same machine-gun double bass drumming, Malmsteen-inspired guitar solos, harpsichord keyboard soloing, and Geoff Tate-inspired singing. In short, I needed more _variety_.    Thankfully, bands like Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, and Nightwish are around to show the rest how to make a good, memorable band.    To me, Sonata Arctica sounds like a bigger, better, more realized Stratovarius. I'd known about the band for a while, and I've always loved the song 'Power Of One' off of Silence(2001) which was my first introduction to them. I finally saw one of their albums in the store the other day, and since I'm always looking for good music, I figured \"why not?\". After listening to this album several times now, I can honestly say that this was one of the best purchases I've made all year. While I do like Stratovarius, the problem I had with them is that their albums would have a couple of really outstanding songs on them, followed by several by-the-numbers tracks which they've formulated to death over and over again. Sonata Arctica has no problems like this. This band takes Stratovarius's sound as a main template, and infuses their own creative songwriting melodies and lyrical topics into it, creating a very memorable and varitable collection of songs. Their singer has that familiar Finnish accent, though it's combined with a real passionate performance. The guitarist always seems to play the right riff at the right time, varying it up from soulfull crunchy riffs to great solos that bring Glen Tipton of Judas Priest to mind. Keyboards go from solo-esque battles to goosebump-inducing atmospheric passages that compliment the melodies.    Picking out favorite tracks on this album is a very difficult thing to do, but the ones that seem to stand out the most are 'APBE', 'Gravenimage', 'The Cage', 'Silver Tongue', 'Champaign Bath', and 'Broken'. 'APBE' and 'The Cage' are two of the fast speed metal tracks, while 'Gravenimage' and 'Broken' both sport unique, melodic overtones to them. 'Champaign Bath' is fast, fun metal that takes you for a hellova ride. Then there's two nice ballads to top the album off: 'The Misery' and 'Draw Me'. These ballads thankfully aren't syrup-drenched like a lot of ballads can get. There aren't any bad tracks in the bunch, and there's something to please anyone that is looking for variety.    Replayability: High. Makes for a perfect power metal fix.    WG proved to be a great starting point for me, and I highly suggest anyone else who sees this album in the stores to give it a shot. They also have a new album out, Reckoning Night(2005) as well as two earlier albums, Ecliptica(1999) and Silence, which many consider their best work. If WG is any indication, then I can't wait any longer to hit up on the other albums. One of the lyrics in the song 'Gravenimage' asks \"Can I still recognize a beautiful melody?\". Yes, you certainly can, and you're certainly one of the best bands in the business at it.     Other recommendations:  -Any other Sonata Arctica album. ALL are outstanding. (judging by the soundclips)  -'Visions' by Stratovarius  -'Epica' and 'The Black Halo' by Kamelot  -'Oceanborne', 'Wishmaster', and 'Century Child' by Nightwis",

The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.      This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's \"That'll Be The Day.\"  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!      It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang \"I'll Get You\" at the London Palladium in 1963, and \"All My Loving\" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include:    *One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970.  *Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting.  *How Do You Do It - the unreleased single.  *Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece.    Die-hard Beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set!",

Louis's first big leap to popular stardom beyond the tight group of Jazz musicians and performers came when he introduced \"Ain't Mis Behavin'\" on the Broadway stage. The audiences often forced him to do three or four encores.  Folks who had seen the show before would pay full price just to get in to hear Louis sing this one song.       The recordings in the late 20s by Louis with all the vocals are simply my idea of the best music ever recorded by anyone. Rather than get them selected this way, you might want to get one of the CDs or collections that covers that period of time with everything, rather than just the songs by Waller.    Likewise, while the All Stars were not as good as his original Chicago and New York Groups, particularly these later all-stars (I prefer the albums with the great Jack Teagarden), if you get into the music you will want that all too.

He just ran out of ideas I guess.  I can believe he doesn't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all.    I've never considered David Bowie a GREAT vocalist, it's a testament to the quality of his Ziggy-era songs that you don't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak, and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up.  And the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter.  I'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums.  But it's not enough to save this lot of songs.  I guess it all depends on what matters more to you, the quality of the song itself, or the vocalist's ability.

Get an interesting voice with lots of expression, put in some good backings and you've got no problems.  But I-20 fails here on both counts.  Does anyone else think that he's got the most annoying voice?  That low drone is just a complete turn off and he doesn't even bother to vary his voice.  Maybe a good beat could have saved him, but there's no salvation here, either.    In fact, the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention, only because we don't have to hear his voice - this makes Backstage & Hey Shawty bearable.  But, really, I-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album.  Feature on other people's songs, sure, then you can still be a star.

Before I tell you all my opinion about this musical, I would like to comment that my recording is slightly different than the one here online. My is the original Canadian Cast. The cover has a gnarled tree against a blazing sunset on it...very interesting. For the most part though, the songs are the same. Some things have been added, taken out, or modified.  Anyway, I got mine at a flee market and couldn't wait to listen because I was a fan of the famous book. I listened and was slightly disappointed with it. Marla Schaffel (I might have spelled her name wrong) has a gorgeous voice and plays the part of Jane very, very well. I haven't heard the man who plays Mr. Rochester on this recording; I have only heard Anthony Crivello portray him. Although the cast matters a good deal, in this musical's case, I believe the score and lyrics count a tiny bit more.  Some songs are truly disgraceful, however, there are several that stand out. My favorites include 'As Good As You', 'Painting My Portrait', 'Secret Soul', and 'In the Light of the Virgin Evening'. I would probably have more favorites if I had heard this recording...unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure to hear 'The Orphan', 'Sirens', 'Finer Things', or 'Rain'. The music is over all very good once you become accustomed to it. The real quality that stands out in this musical are the lyrics.  Lyrically, this play is absolutely brilliant. Even if you ignore the music and the voices...just listen to the words and you will most certainly be moved. Being that Jane Eyre is adapted from a novel, I expected that the lyrics would be predictable and insipid...everything they are not. Over all, I can enjoy this play for not only the musical wonder, but the breathtaking lyrics.  Thanks to those of you who took the time to read my review!  Do any of you viewers agree",

Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.    This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.    This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.

You can walk into any mall right now and find sum 12 year old wearing a casualties shirt, or hat, or wallet, or patch, or toilet seat. They did the warped tour for gods sack. They obviously are worried more about money and fame then music. This has turned into teenybopper music, the same little @#!^'s that listen to blink 182 and sum 41 have this album.

This is not a great punk band, its punk for yuppies.    And to all the people that think its the worst band ever... I am so sick of hearing idiots that think they know everything about punk trashing the casualties saying they are fashion punks... Wether you wunna believe it or not punk has always had to do with clothes... Look at the new york dolls, alice cooper, richard hell, or the sex pistols. They all had a look, a image, and they started this whole thing. \"they said hey richard are you going to go out tonight, i said i am unsertent, I ant feeling to right. But i WRIPED UP MY SHIRT, watched the mirror and flirt, yeah im going to go out, out into sight.\". And im sick of hearing about how they dont know how to play... NO punk bands know how to play, one of the reasons that punk is so great is that anyone can pick up a guitar or a drum set and start a group.

            "input": "One of Elton and Bernie's Best: A Complete Quality Album . \"Honky Chateau\" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. \"Rocket Man\" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. \"Honky Cat\" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his \"redneck ways\" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song \"Mellow\", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice \"You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow\" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in \"I think I am going to Kill Myself\" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of \"Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues\", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with \"I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way\" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. \"Amy\" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice \"Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams\". One of the ultimate classics is \"Mona Lisa\" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings \"Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you\" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, \"Hercules\" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a \"cat named Hercules\".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. \"Rocket Man\" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding \"Slave\" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.",

            "input": "a sparkling gem in early progressive rock history . The album, \"In Rock\", by Deep Purple, was a milestone in early progressive rock history; a gem showcasing British hard rock at its best and an example of this particular genre that was strongly influenced by classical music.  It was the first studio album by a new line-up of the band that attained great success commercially, producing four(4) solid studio albums while touring the world almost nonstop.  The new members of the band were Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, and what a difference their addition made to the sound of the band.  Just take a listen to the song, \"Child In Time\", a timeless masterpiece of more than ten minutes in length.    Just prior to releasing the album, \"In Rock\", the first studio album for this renown line-up of the band, Deep Purple recorded a unique presentation of their work with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  The work was performed (and recorded for later album release) in September of 1969.  Entitled, \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\", the work reflected the band's strong initial ties to classical music, and it was a wonderful foretaste of things to come.  It certainly drew attention to the band.  With the presentation of its first work together as a band at a prestigious venue, namely, The Royal Albert Hall in London, Deep Purple began to forge something new and worthwhile in progressive rock, a path that blended the unique talents of its members, all of whom were accomplished musicians.  Specifically, the band's music was highlighted, and driven, by organist Jon Lord; by the guitar of a true guitar virtuoso in Richie Blackmore; and now, by the strong vocals of a new member of the band, Ian Gillan, who oftentimes wailed and screamed to complement effectively the sheer volume of the music that his bandmates produced.  After all, these were the wonderful beginnings of hard rock in all of its glory!  Nevertheless, and astonishingly as it may seem, the band was not alone on this particular path in rock music history.  Other bands were likewise breaking new ground in 1969 in the progressive rock music field just ahead of the release of Deep Purple's album, \"In Rock.\"  The Moody Blues were already well-established; King Crimson's initial line-up of that year would become a short-lived new-comer; and Yes, having had just released its second album, was still going through personnel changes.  Led Zeppelin, although not a part of the progressive rock music scene, was nevertheless establishing its name in hard rock in 1969, but the band was coming from a different direction musically, drawing its inspiration from the blues.        Another prominent band at that time in the progressive rock music field, The Moody Blues, also had an opportunity to record their music with an orchestra, specifically, The London Festival Orchestra.  The renown line-up of the band with Justin Hayward and John Lodge recorded their initial album, \"Days of Future Past\", with the aforementioned orchestra in 1967.  However, the band decided to play all of the instruments themselves for their second effort, namely, the album, \"In Search of a Lost Chord.\"  Here, The Moody Blues played thirty-three different instruments, including the mellotron.  This relatively new instrument duplicated, to some degree, the wonderful sounds of an entire philharmonic orchestra.  Taking the mellotron into the studio, and afterwards, on the road, on the concert circuit, meant that the band was able to trailblaze, at its own pace, free from being dependent upon a philharmonic orchestra, its unique sound in progressive rock music.  As a result, by 1969, The Moody Blues had already established themselves as innovative musicians in the progressive rock music field and more, with the release of each new album, The Moody Blues continued to broaden their horizons musically and add to their ever-growing fan base.  Unsurprisingly, The Moody Blues broke new ground in 1969 with the release of two phenomenal albums, namely, \"On The Threshhold of a Dream\" and \"To Our Children's Children.\"  Both of these albums are worth a listen.  Significantly, the popularity of these two albums marked a broadening acceptance in 1969 of progressive rock music, and in regards to The Moody Blues, the mellotron became an integral part of their music.  Nonetheless, the stage was set for the following year when the well-known line-up of The Moody Blues would release their fifth album, \"A Question of Balance\", continuing their strong ties with classical music, and Deep Purple would release their gem, \"In Rock.\"    It is important to note here that Deep Purple followed a slightly different path from the one taken by The Moody Blues.  While The Moody Blues preferred softer sounds and vocals that produced memorable ballads and love songs, and at times, the band even added passages of read poetry on their albums, Deep Purple followed the direction of ever-louder music, levels that prompted its singer, Ian Gillan, at times, to wail and scream!  While Deep Purple headed towards the branch of progressive rock music that would eventually be labeled as \"hard rock\", The Moody Blues embraced an entirely different vision.  The band set the controls for their somewhat mystical journey pointed towards the heavens.  On this preset course, The Moody Blues, that is, their music and their lyrics, actually became, at times, heaven-bound, especially when their music was surrounded by, enriched with, and propelled by, the outworldly sounds of the mellotron.    King Crimson was another band that, at that time, was forging new paths in progressive rock music.  King Crimson made its public debut in the summer of 1969 at a free concert in London's Hyde Park with the Rolling Stones, and soon thereafter, the band released its five-song masterpiece, \"In the Court of the Crimson King.\"  The album quickly became a true phenomenon, influencing many musicians at that time.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson used the mellotron; like Deep Purple, the band had a true guitar virtuoso in Robert Fripp; and like the individual members of The Moody Blues, King Crimson employed the services of a multi-instrumentalist in Ian McDonald.  Like The Moody Blues and Deep Purple, King Crimson was strongly influenced by classical music, but the band's music also reflected its ties to jazz and folk music.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson placed considerable weight on the lyrics of its songs, employing the noted lyricist, Peter Sinfield.  However, this initial (and stellar) line-up of the band was to become short-lived, and as a result, it unfortunately only created this one well-received album.    During this period of time, another band was likewise beginning its journey on a path that, with the passage of time, would prove to be extraordinarily successful.  The band was Led Zeppelin.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin's music was oftentimes loud, hence the label, \"hard rock\", but unlike Deep Purple and other progressive rock bands at that time, Led Zeppelin's music was based on the blues and, to some extent, on British folk music.  As a result, Led Zeppelin followed a slightly different path within the hard rock genre than Deep Purple, but its music had such an ever-growing appeal that its popularity influenced many bands both, established and those bands that were just starting out.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin had a true guitar virtuoso in Jimmy Page who, in the early years of the band, played his electric guitar with a violin bow as a novelty and also to produce special effects.  Much like the supergroup, Cream, that preceded them, Led Zeppelin continued to electrify the blues and while the band was reformulating this process, it began to establish its own style, a style that, along with the band, Black Sabbath, and several other bands at that time, began to mold yet another branch of rock called, \"heavy metal.\"  Led Zeppelin released its initial album, \"Led Zeppelin\", in January of 1969, and its second album, \"Led Zeppelin II\", later in the year.  Both of these albums profoundly changed the rock music landscape forever that year",

            "input": "Perfect Pop Album? Not even close . Well, it has been more than two years now, and Perfect Pop Album is (somehow) back after it's very minor success with the first edition, and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse.    First problem, Hollywood Records shouldn't be doing complications. They are Disney Records's sister. I mean, look at the tracklistings. They look like another Radio Disney Jams CD. Joss Stone, Josh Kelly, and Liz Phair are really the only reason buying \"Got Hits 2\". The rest are Disney Channel fillers.    The CD starts with seven Disney acts in a row, starting with Hilary Duff, the lastest flop in the music industry. Depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with \"Metamorphisis\", she didn't even go Gold on her self-titled second album. \"Come Clean\" was really the only big hit by this artist, which to me was a big shocker, \"So Yesterday\" was way better. Then we move to Jesse McCartney, OH BOY! \"Beautiful Soul\" may have a good melody, but Jesse's vocals, awful. And the lyrics make no sense. \"I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul.\" Well, if you think about it, isn't that a beautiful soul? A girl with a pretty face, and good personality? Whatever. Let's move on to JoJo. Okay, I don't mind her, as long as you put something decent by her, like \"Leave (Get Out)\". Instead, they put her hit \"Baby It's You\". The song did well on the charts, and the song is decent, but I think I've had enough. But wait, there's four more! Lindsay Lohan is next up, she didn't have many hit songs, unless you coun't her minor \"Rumors\" big. They put on \"Ultimate\". WTF? When and where was that a hit? Or maybe I should look on foriegn charts to see why Hollywood Records chose this. It was on the 2003 soundtrack \"Freaky Friday\", and all of the sudden it's big. Moving on. Next up is Bow Wow's rival, Romeo. Okay, for all honesty here, how DID he get a record deal? Master P's song \"Make Em Say Ugh\" wasn't bad enough? \"My Cinderella\" is just a poor quality rap song you'd hear on Radio Disney. Then we have Skye Sweetnam. Now, \"Tangled Up In Me\" is actually a decent song. It's melody is damn catchy, and they have pretty good voices. I definitely wouldn't recommended their \"Noise From The Basement\" album. Way too much filler. Then we have unknown Jump 5. Okay, don't name the album Got Hits if you have an unknown artist. Anyway, \"God Bless The U.S.A.\" is horrible, they can't sng their way out of a bag. Then we're FINALLY up with Disney artists (but their revenge comes again later in the CD).    Next, we have a country song by Rascal Flatts. It's okay; not a country fan. The album is called \"Got Hits 2: More Perfect POP\". Notice the uppercase letters. Then, we have our first song worth listening to, from Joss Stone. Though, \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" was barely a hit, it's still an awesome add, as the song is decent. She has a great voice and her songs are great; jazz flavored pop songs.     Then we have Raven-Symone and the Cheetah Girls. I'm not even continuing with this song, since those artists alone should spell trouble.    Luckily, after that, we have alternative rock queen Liz Phair, with her self lyriced \"Extraordinary\". The song is excellent, from the jammin' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics, to her voice. You should definitely check out her music, especially her older stuff.    Two paragraphs back, I said that Disney's revenge is coming. Well, the Disney Radio artists have returned. We have Raven Symone (second time on this CD) doing \"Supernatural\", which was probably the biggest hit in Disney Radio history, and is featured on \"The Haunted Mansion\" soundtrack. On regular Top 40 radio, never heard it. The song is average at best, and the same rule applies. Just because you have a big TV show, does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record. And the same rule applies with the next artist. Once again, the second song on this CD by Hilary Duff, and she brings her sister into the song, which is the third Disney Soundtrack song. This one was featured on the \"A Cinderella Story\" soundtrack. Okay, this remake is just horrific. First, you have the second worst vocals in the history of music (Milli Vanilli being the worst), then you have \"Our Lips Are Sealed\". Now, the Go-Gos version is very good, but the lyrics don't even fit Hilary. Next, we have the Vengaboys. Enough said. Then we have some group called Mr. C and the Slide Man. Maybe I'm not quite old enough, but who the F is this? The song is ridiculous, and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album. Then, Josh Kelley's \"Amazing\" is amazing, and he actually writes his music. That gave me some hope about the end of this album...but wait...we're at the end.                   Unless you're a gigantic fan of Radio Disney and like 2003 songs on a 2005 complication, avoid this on all costs, and get Now 19 in stores Tuesday July 19, 2005.

Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer",

Recorded in the early 90s for Teldec before the  Berg's signed with EMI, These performances are sublime.   You would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid EMI records.  This is THE Bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made Mozart's string quartets sound this good.  Perfect intonation, TONE, blend, dynamics and yes, PASSION.

After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced \"O.C.M.S.,\" to my music collection, my pre-order of \"Big Iron World\" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of \"Wagon Wheel,\" \"Big Iron World\" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their \"old-time\" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.     \"Big Iron World\" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With \"Big Iron World,\" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of \"Big Iron World\" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, \"Union Maid\" and folksy \"James River Blues\" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, \"Big Iron World\" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres.",

Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money.  This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.   This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge.  Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them.",

Wow I just don't know where to start with this album.Well, about the album itself: I think this is best explained by the band, so here's what they think- \"How Strange, Innocence\" was our first attempt at an album. We recorded it in January 2000 in Austin: recording took two days, mixing one day, mastering one day. Altogether we pressed 300 CD-R copies of this album...We had been a band about seven months when we recorded these songs. A lot of feelings (excitement/confusion/glimpses of visions/waking dreams/inability to play instruments) went into this record, but we didn't quite know what to do with those feelings, none of us had even really been in a studio before, and it shows in the recording, the songs show it, too--it's a young record. There are no tricks in it. There's a lightness in a few of the songs that we probably won't reach again. It sounds strange to say that instrumental songs are about something, but to us these songs were/are about such things as a couple walking through the park on a winter day, a child playing on 70's shag carpet, the story of a boy hero leading a revolution against the tyranny of the coal mines. We've had a bit of a love/embarrassment relationship with the record. At certain points along the way several of us wanted to buy back all the copies and burn them. Listening now to this album, it almost seems like a different band composed of four different people. We finally feel okay in re-releasing it, probably because we've now made a couple of records that are recorded better and that are closer to our visions for them. Anyway, we truly appreciate anyone who is interested and listening. Thank you.\"    That was on the CD itself- hope you found that helpful. I like this CD for two reasons. 1.The wonderful way Explosions in the Sky can tell a story through their instruments. 2.This album has a distinct sound- one all its own. If you didn't like Explosions in the sky before, you will once you listen to this album.  -Sherman.",

Standout Tracks: Throw Some Ds is a catchy first single that I didnt like at first and the remix with Andre 3000(he had the best verse on here), Nelly, Murphy Lee, The Game is a lot better than the original. Boy Looka Here is an alright second single plus I like how the beat breaks down. And I Love You had potential to be a great track till Pastor Troy delivers a crappy verse on it but Big Boi held it down on here. Lost Girls and Ghetto Rich(featuring John Legend) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance I'll give credit for. Filler: Rich Boy pulls a Rick Ross and has way too many chick songs on here like What It Do, Good Things, Touch That A**(the worst out of all of them) and On The Regular. Role Models is weak and so is the fillerific Hustla Balla Gangsta Mack and Gangsta. Get To Poppin has to be the worst plus I've heard Pitbull spit over that same horrible beat(and that track sucked too). Bottom Line: 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album.

With Stanley Road Paul Weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days. He hasn't written 12 good songs, instead, he's written one great album. A factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song, making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them.    A mostly guitar driven album, Weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics, often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song, which gladly and competently carries the album along. However, there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel. Though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones, they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that, not only are they a nice change of direction, but also they effortlessly fit in.    Stand-out songs are 'you do something to me', 'broken stones', 'the changing man', 'I walk on gilded splinters' and of course the title track. To truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end. It far outweighs the sum of its parts, and as these parts are so good, you're in for a great journey.",

It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in \"Love Is A Battlefield.\" She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws",

This is one of the fastest, heaviest metal bands in existance, but I could never get in to their early albums, especially Hell Awaits.

Rick Rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should, with everything up front in your face.  Reign in Blood had the most \"in your face\" sound of any record I've ever heard.  Hell Awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of \"Pyromania\" by Def Leppard!  This is one of the heaviest bands in existance.  How is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of Def Leppard?  Thrash is supposed to be \"in your face\".  There's no place for reverb on a speed metal record.  You want to hear heavilly reverbed production, than go buy a Def Leppard CD!

I love everything he does (even \"Victim of Love\"!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of \"The Captain and the Kid.\"  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, \"The Captain and the Kid\" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.    I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, \"The Captain and the Kid\" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid.",

Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.

This song should be sung without vibrato or it destroys the effect of the setting.  The dissonaces that vibrato creates takes away from the beauty of the dissonances that Mr. Whitacre has written.  Unfortunately for the listener, vibrato is used in this recording and destroys nearly all of the beauty contained in this wonderful piece.  Aside from that, the rest of the CD is neither good nor bad.  Discerning listeners will hear the differences.  The music of Rene Clausen is treated well in this recording, but not understood completely by choir or conductor.

Just in time for their induction into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame comes this new Blondie collection that showcases some of the band's most popular, influential songs, material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them. \"Sound & Vision,\" like most Best Of sets is both a good introduction to the band's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes Blondie, but enough to purchase every album. There is no doubt that Debbie Harry and the gang not only produced good music, but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like Shirley Manson, Gwen Stefani and yes, Madonna. Befire Princess Diana ever graced magazine covers, Harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real Punk at heart, posing at times with such figures as Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop (eventhough at one point Patti Smith told her to \"get the f--k out of rock n' roll\"). \"Sound And Vision\" nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70's through mid-80's. A lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like \"Call Me\" with it's roaring chorus and electro sheen while \"Heart Of Glass\" is still a classic jam, disco has died and yet this song remains. \"Rapture\" is still a long, dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before Aerosmith and Run DMC ever broke the barrier of rock and rap. Newer material is also present here, \"Maria\" was a single off the band's 1999 album \"No Exit,\" but it still has that classic Blondie sound. However I do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song \"Good Boys\" off their latest release, \"The Curse Of Blondie.\" The original version is a great song, but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow, the same for the \"In The Flesh\" remix which rips the song apart, turning it into cold, techno sludge. Luckily there is one worthy remix present, \"Rapture Riders,\" which brilliantly meshes \"Rapture\" with The Doors' \"Riders On The Storm.\" Both songs flow perfectly together and it's a fitting combination since Blondie have always named The Doors as a prime influence and favorite band. Too bad Jim Morrison died in 1972, you get the feeling he and Harry would have done a marvelous duet. The extra DVD that comes with the set is a must for Blondie fans, many of the band's videos are included for classics like \"Heart Of Glass,\" \"The Tide Is High\" and even the recent videos for \"Maria\" and \"Good Boys.\" \"Sight In Sound\" a fun ride through the Blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies, and a neat teaching tool for those who wanna know why girls like Gwen, Shirley and even Britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from",

I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person)  Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.    The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of \"a line allows prgress\"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.    Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  \"a perfect sonnet\".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.    As I press on to: \"on my way to work\" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?    The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.    Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.    Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better",

I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.     This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.    However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. \"I Wish\" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled \"O\", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. \"Touch\" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget \"Growing Pains\", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!    However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!      NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career",

This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).    Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique",

Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as \"Little Women.\"    As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as \"The Secret Garden\" or \"Jane Eyre.\" But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.    The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions \"Take A Chance On Me\" and \"Small Umbrella In The Rain\" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.     The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.    It's obvious why when you listen to \"Little Women\"- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else..",

I've been a Randy Newman fan \"ever since there WUZ no Randy Newman,\" and so picture my delight when my very own kids bought me this boxed bonanza for Christmas (so I wouldn't have to). Randy Newman on the stereo on Christmas morning is about as Newmanesque a way to disturb the warmth of home and hearth as you can imagine. At one time or another I've owned every Newman album ever recorded, so I needed this collection like another hole in the head, but I have to recommend it as much for the surprisingly revealing biographical data as for the song selections. There are surprises here for even an old Newman trivialist like myself, and it was a relief to read of Randy's hardships as well as successes, since the dark side of this dark soul has too often been danced around in past articles and interviews. We learn that Randy's father, Irving Newman, MD, was an overbearing and cantankerous coot not above slugging it out with perfect strangers on public highways. We learn that the distracting eye condition Randy was born with, and the failed surgical attempt to correct it, may have helped to mold not only Newman's unique world view, but his discomfort with public attention. Interviewers (myself included) have generally conceded that \"Randy Newman just can't look you in the eye,\" but then, why should he when he has such a gift for cutting straight to the heart with his nostalgic sentiments and shark-attack wit. Of the many selections in this package, my standouts are his 1962 demo Golden Gridiron Boy, a delight to hear at long last since throughout Newman's career it has appeared as nothing more than a musical history anecdote. Turns out it is a quite competent version of that idiotic pop sub-genre of the '50s and early '60s when unrequited love burned teenybopping hearts alive to the accompanyment of snickering female vocal backups. Then comes Jesus in the Summertime, the highly unlikely mock spirtual that has the distinction of having been so offensive to so many ears that a session musician actually walked out of the studio rather than play on it. Now THAT's chutzpah! Personally, I like it, and find nothing offensive about it, other than the fact that it has the name Jesus in the title. Finally, there's Laugh and Be Happy, an unfortunately incomplete demo that features Newman at his Tin-Pan-Alley best, with a catchy ragtime riff and a delightfully mocking lyric. This number is for my money one of the best tracks ever laid down by one of our most consistently rewarding, if challenging, singer-songwriters. Thanks for the memories, Randy!",

Also, Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, an opera intermission music by Mascagni, is heard here. I think these things are all out of place. There should be more emphasis on the music of Shakespeare's time- oboe, flute and Renaissance instruments. The soundtrack to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing &quot; is even better since it does manage to remain Shakespearian. But otherwise this music is beautiful, especially the Midsummer Night's Dream Music by Mendelsshon -the Overture is a delightful, sunny piece to hear and then there is the famous signature Wedding March. I recommend anyone to get the entire classical work- the Scherzo is just as good and other selections. This cd is good but not great.

The SWEET have attained their adolescence. Although they do not have total control (yet) of the final product, they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest. This gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product. As adolescents, gone is the \"goodie two-shoes\" image. The topics now range from fast cars (Rebel Rouser) to bi-sexual women (AC-DC). In the 70's the \"moral majority\" still ruled over freedom of expression, so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour.    Oh yes the music...I could decipher the music for pages but I'll let YOU do it. Someone once wrote that SWEET was a fly by night, 3 chord churning and \"very limited talent wise\" band.

First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!         Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.         I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...         I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word \"Nothing\" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.         You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think \"Whoa!  Who's THIS?!\" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song \"Out of Range\" would do in less than 16 seconds.         Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called \"Wishful Thinking\") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: \"ZEIT\".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.       As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.         I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves \"WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!\"         Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song \"Next Time I Fall In Love\" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than \"Paranoid\" by Black Sabbath.       Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.         Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, \"Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!\"         I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.

Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.      To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.

Fans of The Walkmen rejoice--this is the better purchase of the two~this LP is packed full of college radio singles, including \"Gender Bombs\" and \"Changes Are No Good.",

The range between all the vocalists is very vast and very welcome.    \"American Money\": Is the bounty hunter t.v. show's theme, very western with it's banjo and gunshots.  \"Don't Bother None\": An awesome blues-rock song sung by the gruff Mai Yamane. Here voice is rough and raw and perfectly fit for this kind of song.  \"Live in Baghdad\": The random metal song in the mix, with surf guitar. I love this song exactly for it's randomness in the series.  \"Cats on Mars\": A super-cute song! This is the absolute cutest song of the series. It's poppy, it's cute, it's fun. Hard to resist.  \"Green Bird\": A sweet vocal by Gabriela Robin, her voice is so gentle and nice.  \"Elm\": A song that sounds like a medieval ballad from a skilled guitarist.

            "input": "Far Under-rated . This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.      It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.    There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard \"wheel\" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket.     Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.    Friends has nice \"happy\" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.    Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.    Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.    Out on the Tiles is another rocker.    Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.    Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.    That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.    Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.    Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people \"in the know\".    All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.    Buy this at once!",

For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too",

Lisa captures the mood (much like she did with Gladiator) with her special unique voice & style.   Lisa's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if I am going through a re-birthing. The sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come. The struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace.

I like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity.  Therefore, I find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring KRS's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades.    Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.    The songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics.  KRS is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people.  That aspect of his work is forgotten on this album, and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching.  It's almost like he's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality, and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there.    Musically, the beats are mostly just plain terrible, and feel devoid of warmth or personality.  The lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent, the writing is not up to his usual high standard.    Most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together, or the hooks of their songs.  Few are known for true lyrical ability.  KRS has never before fallen victim to this trap.  The reason Criminal Minded, Boom Bap and Necessary did so well was the mix of good writing, excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented.  Everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums (and many, if not most, of KRS's other offerings) - the same can't be said with this album, as he didn't find the right mix to present the material.    Pick up this album if you want a complete KRS ONE collection - otherwise, leave it on the shelf",

The single itself, \"Only\", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak \"Down In It\" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of \"Down In It\", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.    The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of \"The Hand That Feeds\" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of \"Love is Not Enough\" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.    For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones",

SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP.  2.\"HE SAY SHE SAY\"- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY.  3.\"HURT ME SOUL\"- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK.  4.\"SUNSHINE\"- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL.  5.\"PRESSURE\" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.    OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE \"JUST MIGHT BE OK\", \"DAYDREAMININ\", \"KICK PUSH\", \"I GOTCHA\",\"INSTRUMENTAL\", AND \"AMERICAN TERRORISTS\".    I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!",

            "input": "Better Than Just \"1980s Music\" . As ballad pop goes, Journey is there. These are the songs which were played at proms throughout the 1980s. Filled with romance, emotional passion and Steve Perry's unrelenting voice, Journey's \"The Essential Journey\" are a mix of hard, mild and melodic pop rock.     Occasionally, the band would turn out mediocre music, like \"Girl Can't Help It,\" but most is still worth listening to. \"Be Good to Yourself\" sounds like a bad movie soundtrack song, and is not worthy of this otherwise amazing CD.    There are two disks, with more music than the average listener is familiar with, and only hardcore fans with know. A few hits are missing, leaving a real best-of CD still out there.    Journey was a pop band: Simple lyrics without a heavy message. Distinguishing them was their willingness to step out of the known musical formulas. Club music was coming into its own in the 1980s, with DJs sampling and mixing. Their music doesn't sample well, and they risked being a radio-only band. As their hit list grew from \"Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'\" into a rich repertoire, their concerts became packed into stadiums. Those are the songs here.     It is 1980s music in every sense of the term, but better than just as music from the period, just like James Taylor is better than just being a musician from the 1970s. I fully recommend, \"The Essential Journey\" by Journey.     Anthony Trendl   editor, HungarianBookstore.co",

Paul Leary is quite underrated and Gibby Haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause. But they still have a lot of weirdness and that's where some of the filler comes in, but then I never even skip past the German guy.   Bloodlust said everything I needed to say but I'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock, like Kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals.    Dust Devil is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever written.  \"Got the power of an upright in his g****m hand! Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",

Steve Earle didn't talk much about Car Wheels in his autobiography other than to say working with Lucinda was a real drag. Well, whatever. Obviously it produced incredible results and no matter how difficult she is they should look into working together again. Because frankly, w/o Earle, Lucinda Williams writes fairly boring songs and puts them to even more boring arrangements. And without Lucinda, Steve Earle does fairly generic country that is rarely worth a second listen. Together, they're awe inspiring.    Anyway, on to Essence: boring songs+boring arrangments+drugged-out singing=bad album. Trying to pimp the tracks up with production pixie dust doesn't fix the fundamental problem here: the songs are lame. In place of insight we get shopping lists, in place of hooks we get verse, verse, verse. And in place of emotion we get slurred vocals.     Such ingredients do not make for a good record.      as a side note, if you filter by \"most helpful\" you get reviewers who aren't 5-star fanboy clones and write intelligent reviews.

The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal.

Most will already have heard the singles \"letter 2 My Unborn\" and \"Until The End Of Time\", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles.  Other notable tracks are \"This Aint Livin\" which is probably the best track on here, \"Breathin\", \"Everything They Owe\", \"Lastonesleft\", \"M.O.B\" and \"World Wide Mob Figgaz\".  In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good.    It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs.  Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame.  I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much.

Her gorgeous debut album, Wreck of the Day, got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single \"Breathe (2 a.m.),\" so of course those dolts at Columbia Records went with \"In the Rough\" as a follow-up (why not that magnificent title track?  Or \"Forever Love\"?  Or even \"Citadel,\" for cryin' out freakin' loud?!), and of course it tanked.  But then, just like manna straight from the fingertips of God Himself, the geniuses (geniui?) behind TV's gangbusters smash \"Grey's Anatomy\" used \"Breathe\" to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season's most-watched episode, and Nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness.  Top forty was interested again, and Columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing Nalick's album with extra tracks, one of them being -- get this, guys -- a newly-recorded version of \"Wreck of the Day\" that is so balls-out horrendous, you just *know* they're going to make it the third single.

Every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes. Jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at Nas(Takeover), radio cuts(I.Z.Z.O), emotional wordplay(Song Cry). Highlights include \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Never Change\", and is topped off with \"Renegade\" which in my opinion CONTAINS HIP-HOP'S GREATEST VERSE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS by Eminem. Even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper. Jay has been called commercial, but who ever says that ain't listening.",

            "input": "Yay ESP! . In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!            ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.            Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!           Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?            Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)          The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.            Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.           Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.            Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, \"All right I'll stay!\"           In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!           Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!           ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.            Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting.",

I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her.

His tunes and lyrics can be deceptively simple ( Junk, Man we was Lonely ) but listen closely to what he's saying. He doesn't shove your face in how he feels, unlike Lennon's \"How do You Sleep\" or even Ringo's \"Boogaloo\".

You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album.    This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future.    Lullabies is utterly amazing.

I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.

It's a laid-back, mostly acoustic disc which in some places reminds me of the Jayhawks or the Eskimos, and in other places reminds me of the O Brother! Where Art Thou? soundtrack. There's even one track (Restless Sinner) that sounds a bit like the Grateful Dead.    There were a lot of songs with religous overtones (pretty much the entire back half of the album, actually), which was surprising at first but not jarring enough to distract the listener too much.

To this day, when I hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song, I instinctively grit my teeth, get my rock face on, and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel.  This is a powerful record, one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout.  The desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in TITR's music, but it's bound tight with melody, memorable time signatures, and pop-savvy structures.  Granted, Garrett's voice can drive people away from the band if they aren't willing to give it time (he's more than a tad nasal), but the songs stick with you.  Definitely an album to purchase if you're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90's tail end of the \"emo/post hardcore\" movement.

She has never \"played it safe\"...until now.    First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for \"Cry\".  \"Cry\" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  \"Lead Me On\", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.    As for \"Fireflies\", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked \"Cry\", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.      The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.      I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of \"This Kiss\" and \"Breathe\".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: \"Fireflies\" is not selling as well as \"Breathe\" and \"Faith\" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the \"I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you\" image that Faith has unveiled",

After realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following, System of a Down broke through to the mainstream with Toxicity, an album even crazier than it's predecessor, with tricky time-changes, funky drum patterns, fast guitar riffs with odd tunings, and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world's problems. Where their first album is heavier, this one is more complex. You can find yourself in a groove, only to have it change, and seconds later have it change again. There are lots of mosh-worthy moments, and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to Daron's style and unique tuning.    This album takes a while to get used to, it changes quickly and frequently. John is an amazing drummer and I feel he is too overlooked and doesn't get the recognition he deserves.    The lyrics have a purpose, at times they will make you think, and at times they will make you laugh. These guys are serious, but don't take themselves too seriously.    In my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any Sytem fan or metalhead in general, though it may be a little too crazy for some people.    System of a Down on this album is:    Serj Tankian - Lead Vocals, Keyboards, String Arrangements  Daron Malakian - Guitars, Backup Vocals  Shavo Odadjian - Bass, Vocals  John Dolmayan - Drum",

But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!     instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.    The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)    C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something..

I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his \"Hallelujah\" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on \"Grace\" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.

            "input": "A review and a question . First my review:    The recorded legacy of MJH falls into roughly five categories.     (1) his early 1928 recordings on the OKEH label which comprise around 20 tracks. Although they are quite listenable and of historical interest and importance they are not the most enjoyable of his recordings. (2) recordings from 1963 that are available on the Rounder label. The sound quality of these recordings is somewhat disappointing. For that reason alone I don't listen to them much except for the fact that they were heavily relied upon by people who transcribed his songs for instructional materials. (3) The Library of Congress recordings (also from 1963). These are perhaps the best. The sound quality is excellent and there is an informality to the sessions which makes it like having MJH as a house guest for the weekend determined to play you every song he knows. (4) The (these) Vanguard Recordings, which I think were recorded between 1967 and 1969. These rival and sometimes surpass the Library of Congress Recordings as far as the material goes. There is also a palpable sadness as you can detect a man near the end of his life aware of the fact that he may very well be making his final recordings. The audio engineers did a terrible job at Vanguard for a good deal of these recordings. How can you screw up recording just one guy with a guitar? If you try hard enough you can set the levels WAY off. That is how. (5) there is also a Live MJH CD from Vanguard. It's sound quality is pretty good and it is endearing to hear MJH talk to an audience, but I find it less compelling material wise than the studio recordings.    Listening to MJH makes you want to piick up the guitar and learn to play like him. The good thing about this is that if you really want to you probably can. Many of his songs have been transcribed and broken down in intructional books and DVDs. After going through a \"beginning fingerpicking\" DVD by Stefan Grossman you are probably ready to take on MJH.    Go for it!    And now for my question:    It's not obvious to me from the Vanguard website whether the boxed set is actually a newer digital remaster than the original digital re-masters from the mid 80s. As far as digital remasters go those ones were a bit of a disaster. When you put the disc into your player you would have to crank the volume on your stereo. As you might expect, the careless lack of attention to levels setting in the remastering process resulted in a mushy sounding guitar. I seem to remember that was also a problem with the vinyl Vanguard LPs, particularly the first one. Hopefully these CDs really  are *new* remasters because most CDs re-mastered these days are remastered quite well.    My music management software for encoding MP3s has the capability of looking up CDs in an online database. Whenever I present it with copies of the old mid 1980s vanguard CDs it recognizes them as possibly being from the boxed set, so I hesitate to spring for the \"new remasters\" without really knowing if they are indeed recently remastered. Perhaps someone else could clear this up",

Sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged \"Lovin Touchin Squeezin\" and \"City of The Angels\".  They have failed to correct this error with this newer, supposedly \"re-masterd\" version.      On the original vinyl release, \"City Of The Angels\" kicked in before the final chorus of \"Lovin Touchin Squeezin\" had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for \"Feelin' That Way/Anytime\" on Infinity.  At the time, some AOR radio stations even played these two tracks together.    As completely seperate tracks on CD, the famous ending of \"Lovin Touchin Squeezin\" becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly. Ultimately, it is only a couple seconds cut off (reverb echoing to silence) - But as one of Journey's signature tunes, you'd think that they'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release.    The original ending of 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin\" (with final seconds of reverb) can be heard on the two disc collection, Essential Journey - but of course, as the set is a collection of radio songs, it does not segue into \"City Of The Angels\" as it originally did (and should) on Evolution.    A minor point I know.  BUT - Sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release. They should take the time to check all the details to get it right.  Or - why bother",

There is just something about listening to Mr. Buffett in the Caribbean, Florida too, that seems so right. His catchy, lyrical, sailing stories, drinking stories, personal stories never get old. They're as fresh the hundredth time as they were the first time. This collection is simply outstanding in every way, not a turkey in the bunch, and oh yes, Mr. B has sung a few turkeys in his day, but as I said, they are not here. These songs will move you to laughter, maybe a tear or two and they may have you up and dancing a bit, but most of all they well waken a sense of adventure in you. Well, they should anyway, unless you're a died in the wool, TV watching, couch potato.

It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.    If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.    Some good examples of ballads:  The Devil Went Down to Georgia,  The Ballad of Jesse James,  Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier,  Ode to Billie Joe    While there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not.

I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.     \"As It Is When It Was\" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. \"All Day Long\", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While \"Angel Dust\" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off \"Every Little Counts\" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.    The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, \"Bizarre Love Triangle\". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)    Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote.",

Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In \"Preacher's Daughter\" he even says \"A preacher's daugher so she had common sense.\" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then \"Pass Me Over\" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. \"Sista Big Bones\" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this",

Girlfriends, boyfriends, single people, married people, old, young, male, female.    You probably already know (and like) at least 3 songs from this album: \"Every Morning\", \"Someday\", \"Falls Apart\".  So, you're already off to a great start.    And, for those of you old-school Sugar Ray ROCK fans, there's plenty here for you.  Try \"Personal Space Invader\", \"Aim For Me\", \"Glory\", and \"Burning Dog\" if you enjoy cranking it to 11.  Actually, this album is predominantly rock inspired...if you've  listened to the WHOLE THING.    Hip hop fans will find \"Live and Direct\" featuring KRS-One to be a pleasant little surprise.    80's fans will take to their spiced up rendition of Steve   Miller's \"Abracadabra\".    And, they've got some nice softer tunes in the form of \"Ode to the Lonely Hearted\" and \"Even Though\" (a song which seems to have jumped off the time machine from the 50's or something...good stuff).    And, of course there a bits and pieces of that trademark Sugar Ray humor thrown about the album.  Like they always say, Sugar Ray is all about having fun.  Period.  If things like \"image\" matter to you, then steer clear of this band.  If dogmatic adherence to one specific style of music (and ONLY one specific   style of music) excites you then steer clear of this band.    But, if you like having fun with your music (a.k.a. ENJOYING it) and if you can appreciate diverse musical influences, then here ya' go",

Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.   But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it.

It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me.

The influences are many and varied...Beach Boys, Beatles, Osmonds, Neil Sedaka, Jimmy Webb, The Who, Styx, Yes, Chicago, Alan Parsons, ELO/Jeff Lynn, Astrud Giberto, Wondermints, Burt Bacharach, Supertramp, 60's Brit Pop, the list goes on... As for Roger's vocal ability, he's no Bocelli, but he is better than 90% of the front men out there.  He has a unique \"honey\" styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days (think Joseph Williams, David Pack, Donnie Osmond, Gerry Beckley).  He doesn't try to imitate anyone, and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained.  Primarily a keyboardist, his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well.  Can't think of enough good things to say about this artist.  Not every cut is excellent, but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive.  The three deleted cuts from Solid State Warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40...during some point of time. Buy this CD Now",

He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.     Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.     I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that \"hip-hop\" tomfoolery of theirs.

It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well.     The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction.     I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album.

It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in \"Power, Corruption Lies\" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.      The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for \"Blue Monday\" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  \"Age of Consent\" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also \"the Village\"  is a great track as well.    If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!    -- Ted Murena",

Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the  ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black,  blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught  himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the  roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his  last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they  paste up, &quot; Feinman Lives&quot; Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child.

Marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow, it's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath.    Graded as a complementary album to \"Illinois,\" however, I'd give it three stars.  I can understand why the songs weren't used and find several of them worth repeated listening.    If i could give half stars, this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length.  The respective lengths of \"Illinois\" and \"Michigan\" weren't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks.  A compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is",

I wasn't a Sarah fan in 1999 when the \"Mirrorball\" tour came through my backyard, where \"Mirrorball\" was recorded live, at Portland Oregon's Rose Garden.  But I had become a fan, and was at her show, when she came through with the \"AfterGlow\" tour.  By the time \"AfterGlow\" was out, I had just discovered the original Mirrorball CD and DVD, and up until the release of this 2-CD set, the original \"Mirrorball\" live CD and DVD were my \"most played\" CD and DVD of my whole 700+ various artist collection.  But even before finishing the first CD of this 2 CD set, I know that I had to have another copy for the car.  Sarah Fan?  You must buy this now.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  It is the full show, with all of her interactions with the crowd, and the sound is better than either of the previously released Mirrorball CD and DVD titles.  I love live music, and this set is a dream come true.  Sarah is a true performer \"live\", and I think is actually at her best when performing \"live\".  Absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-CD Full Concert Live set.  And if you get a chance to see her perform, pay whatever it costs to see her show",

The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by \"Fantasticks\" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both",

Second, I really don't care for \"The Hand That Feeds\".    Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.    The remixes fare no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious, the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus.    If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S",

He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the &quot;Prototype Years&quot; ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.

And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of \"covers\" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' \"First Utterance,\" the Incredible String Band's \"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\" or Shirley Collins' \"No Roses\" instead",

The old timers like me back in the inner cities where Smokey and the Miracles orginally put their stake down in Motown and R&B royalty, used to call him Bill Smokey Robinson. Whenever I meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in Japan radios were blaring down the New York City school hallways playing The Tracks of my Tears, Shop Around, OOO Baby Baby (which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the Junior High School gym) and the Tears of a Clown, all selections being on The Ultimate Collection~Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, I know that my buddy remembers Smokey's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery. I apologize to my readers for run on sentences but Smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul, R&B and the Motown wall of sound (they had one too) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated. I heard that Smokey recently brought his performance to Flint, Michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country. I really wish that I could have been there to see Smokey put out before a hometown crowd. That must have been nothing short of a miracle. I am going to hit the click button now myself, I need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in Junior High with the made in Japans, fingerpopping all the way. Please note, I meant to push 5 stars on this CD and cannot figure out how to correct the above. I apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by Smokey's music probably realized this faux pas.    Jay Adler,    Massapequa, New Yor",

And then just when you think you're listening to a 60's pop album, &quot;Billy Hunt&quot;'s Guitar intro punches in, reminding you, The Jam were many things, including a great Punk Band.

The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it.

Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it.

The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.   What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.   There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like \"Swim\": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire.\" Or the artistic suicide of the last track, \"X-Girlfriend\", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.   That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between \"Machinehead\" and \"Glycerine.\" The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building.",

The album has upbeat pop/rock, like \"Bend and Break\" and \"This is the Last Time,\" slow, sorrowful ballads, like \"She Has No Time\" and \"We Might as Well be Strangers,\" gentle, peaceful melodies, like \"Sunshine,\" and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like \"Untitled 1\" and \"Bedshaped.\" Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers.",

If the Astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says: \"FEATURING: 'SUPER 16', AS HEARD IN THE NEW QUENTIN TARATINO MOVIE KILL BILL VOL.1!!!\" Then watch the sales of NEU! 2 surge its way up to the top of the Billboard album charts, purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick.    Okay, that may never happen, but still, it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of \"Super 16\"'s turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of Tarantino's movie. \"Super 16\" might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music, but as representation of the superb, and breif, discography of NEU!'s body of work it does the band a great disservice. Hearing this track rekindled my interest in NEU!'s music again, and to write this review.    NEU! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves, the first half, which consits of the first 4 tracks: \"Fur Immer\", \"Spitzenwualitat\", \"Gedenkminute\", and \"Lila Engel\" (as of this writing Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect) . This is the heart of the album, with the driving \"Fur Immer\" connecting the dots between Kraftwerk's motor beats with alternative rock riffing.  \"Lila Engel\"  pounds agressively like there's no tomorrow, years before it became fashionable in punk music.  Did I mention this music was originally released in '73? Awesome!    The second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which, reportedly due to budget restraints, were recorded with minimal material. The band's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable (complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping). The woozy \"Cassetto\" feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last, wretched gasp. This section of NEU! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form. Although it's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion, the approach wears itself thin quite early, and hardly justifies any repeat listens.      I would say that NEU! 2 is second best behind the band's self-titled debut (Rating: 5 stars), and tied with their 3rd and final(?) effort NEU! 75, where NEU! were beginning to sound too self-conscious, IMHO.  NEU!'s music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled \"alternative\" these days.  It's good enough for Tarantino, and it's good enough for you! BUY IT!    Favorite tracks:  \"Fur Immer\", \"Lila Engel\",  \"Super\"   Final Rating: 3.5 out of 5.",

Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important.  But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.    The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05",

This happens to be the best Jazz/Country fusion album ever done. There's great musicianship here. There's EXCELLENT instrumental solos that can take up half of the track as in \"Move On\". This is superb music that never made it to the radio. These tracks are simply too long to have gotten air play back in the 1970s. L&M put together a truly great album with Mother Lode but not too many people have heard it. Sadly, they broke up shortly after this album was released. Afterwards, Kenny made a come-back by going strictly pop.",

At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.    To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.      If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.      I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, \"If the South Woulda Won,\" which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song.",

Then I heard \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. \"Outshined\" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:    1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great;  Chris Cornell hits some great notes too.  2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell.  3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out.  4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks   a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good.  5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end.  6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some \"screamage\".  7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating \"The devil sounds like this\" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too.  8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5  9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly.  10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good.  11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment)  12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!",

I'm a huge fan of John Powell's scores and I'm glad (again) I bought this score.     The score sounds a little bit like 'The Italian Job' with a spanish flavour to it, because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars. Although the tracks are new and refreshing, I found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd. Like: the 'house fight' part with al the percussion instruments. It's on the cd ('Kiss and Make Up - I believe), and it's a brilliant piece of percussion, but it's not the same as in the movie (that sounded better to me).     Second: the cd is a little on the short side. The total play length of the soundtrack is only 44 minutes. A lot of tracks (20) all relatively short, but... different. So you'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody's. Something to get used to after listening to the more monotone Bourne Identity soundtrack.

There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.    Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.    All of the tracks on here are solid.     For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.    All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.    All in all, BUY THIS CD",

            "input": "The Pick of the Bunch . Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.    'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that \"Heroes\" tops it in every regard.    The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.    The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on \"Heroes\", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:    'Your lips cut a smile on your face'    'There's slaughter in the air  Protest on the wind  Someone else inside me  Someone could get skinned'    'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life  They never die, they just go to sleep one day'    And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the \"Heroes\" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released.       The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on \"Heroes\" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.    Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.    If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend \"Heroes\" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release.     It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist.",

WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE was the first hit from the album. It tells about world history from 1949(the year of Billy's birth) to 1989,the year this album was released. THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot; is about a fisherman's life on a boat called THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot;. Alexa is Billy's daughter whose mom is Christie Brinkley. I GO TO EXTREMES has the style of Billy's Columbia records labelmates,Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. SHAMELESS starts off in a contemporary style and later converts to hard rock. STORM FRONT is another boat song. LENINGRAD is a ballad about a Russian man named Viktor and an American man and his daughter(possibly Billy and Alexa) visiting there. STATE OF GRACE really rocks. WHEN IN ROME has listeners &quot;doing what the Romans do&quot;. Then there's the easy listening AND SO IT GOES which is only Billy's voice and piano.

He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.    I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.    I do like two songs on here.  \"Till The Ends Meet\" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is \"Angry Eyes.\" The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.    The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer.",

Hez carries an anointing nobody else carries, he is a pastor first and a singer second, his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to  try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as Hezekiah Walker",

Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a \"rock\" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a \"good\" song while Alex's delivery makes it a \"great\" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to \"get together\" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just \"meant\" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of \"Smooth\" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job.",

Don't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that TKK has delivered to its fans for many a year. The mixes butchered the originals to the point that it's not even novel, just cotton candy filler. How TKK allowed this malformed release is beyond me. The only purpose I see that this \"tribute\" could serve is to introduce TKK to a young lightweight, whose ears are not used to original industrial epics. Either that, or only for the hardcore TKK fan who just wants to have every release. The dust on my copy is already accumulating, and probably will for some time. If you're looking to dip your toes into My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, don't buy this CD. Stick with the new greatest hits release, or better yet, start with any release prior to \"Hit & Run Holiday\"",

            "input": "Simply one of the finest albums you'll ever encounter . It is almost impossible for any album on Amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall 5 star rating, yet DIFFERENT CLASS has managed to do just that.  Although Pulp has several really good albums, this is their best in my opinion.  It isn't just that the songs are musically compelling; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex.  When this album was first released in England it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation.  Critics declared it a masterpiece, and fans bought it in astonishing numbers.  The album also is deceptively political, in that it features class difference in a large number of songs.      There are many musical highlights on the album, but what I find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison, while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast.  Fans will always differ on their favorites, but few will question that the album starts off strongly with \"Mis-Shapes.\"  \"I Spy\" is one of my favorites on the album along with \"Disco 2000,\" which follows it.  \"Sorted for E's and Wizz\" is another stunner.  But seriously, all the songs on the disc are at least good, most are very good, and two or three are great.  But the best of the bunch is unquestionably \"Common People.\"    \"Common People\" is simply a great song on multiple levels.  Musically it is incredibly compelling, one of those tunes that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head, with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around.  But this would merely make it a good song; what makes it great is the story the song tells.  An art school student is noticed by a fellow student, a rich girl from Greece, who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people.  There is a definite sexual come on, as she says that she wants \"to sleep with common people, like you.\"  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.  But the song instantly takes you in a different tangent.  What follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected.  Our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money, a notion she laughs at.  At this point the song turns very serious and dark, as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair.  He tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over, but to truly find out what it would be like to live like \"common people\" would mean learning what it means to have no choices, no outs, no control.  He sings:    You will never understand  How it feels to live your life  With no meaning or control    So instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning, we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off.  I know of no other song like it.  Pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs, but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites.  It definitely goes onto my all time Top 40.    There are four Pulp albums that I think any serious music fan should own:  HIS 'N' HERS, DIFFERENT CLASS, THIS IS HARDCORE, and WE LOVE LIFE.  If one were bound and determined to own only one Pulp album, one might go with HITS, but this DIFFERENT CLASS is so good that I just can't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well.  Trust me:  if you don't own this album you need to get it today.  Your ears will thank you",

Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see \"alternative\" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other \"serious\", \"sensitive\" \"hip\" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days).",

I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.    The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.    Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!    Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!    Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you",

Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blues instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's \"I've still got legs\" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the ingenious pairing of Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples, and Eric Clapton tacked on for good measure. SMOOTH, the funky, blistering Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century was the catylist, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever (take THAT, Michael). Since Carlos Santana has always utilized a variety of vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker) and musical styles, hearing him play rock, hip-hop and jazz in tandem with everyone from Lauryn (Where'd she go, anyhoo?) Hill to Dave Matthews to Everlast is not such a far fetched notion.  MARIA MARIA even has the Product G&B extolling the virtues of \"Carlos Santana\" by name in their slniky groove-enriched rap. On the strictly Spanish-speaking side, CORAZON ESPINADO (featuring Mana) sounds infectious in ANY language, and the rest is the vintage Latino rock that this cat was blowin' light years before Ricky Martin was even a Menudo. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana claus. RATING: FIVE FIESTAS",

Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets.

The clever weaving of songs, scenes, and, most interestingly, letters, make for a great cast album.    As for performances, it's the females who own this show. Marin Mazzie is as glorious as ever as Clara (she's even better in Ragtime), and Tony-winner Donna Murphy brings all of the emotion forward in her portrayal of Fosca.

            "input": "A Demanding Listen, but a Great  One . It ain't easy being an interpreter.    Christopher O'Riley's an accomplished classical pianist, but his biggest claims to fame are three piano interpretations of modern musicians--two discs worth or re-imagined Radiohead, and now this excellent exploration of Elliott Smith.     Most respectable classical musicians don't do this sort of thing--they usually stick to what are deemed respectable composers. And the ones who do bother with anything composed after, say, 1925 and played on anything other than orchestra instruments? They become a little trashy by association, exuding a faint odor of music whoredom as they ride the rock n' roll gravy train from the New Release section to the Bargain Bin. (This happens whether they're re-interpreting the Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd or, heaven help us, Metallica.) Heck, most musicians in general are fearful of doing too much of someone else's work, lest they be seen as bar-band ready tribute acts rather than as the sainted singer-songwriters they'd like to be.     Thank heavens O'Riley's not like most musicians. He seems to see interpretation as something like what it used to be in the Frank Sinatra heydey--something anyone can and should do as much as they want to, provided they're patient enough to really take their time about it and bold enough to make someone else's songs their own. For that's the true test of a musician--not whether or not they cover other people's work, but whether they put in the effort to give their audience something more than a tracing-paper copy of a song's original outlines.    By that standard, O'Riley's latest outing's a smashing success. It is a demanding listen--don't just pop in while riding the subway to work. I'm thinking headphones at home, late night, no distractions, just you and Chris and Chris's piano and Elliott's ghost.    On his previous outings, O'Riley had an easier task--on most Radiohead songs, lyrics and musical tone match pretty well. (Paranoid songs sound paranoid. Unhappy songs sound unhappy. And...well, that just about covers it, actually. Not that I'm complaining, Thom.) But what made Elliott special, among other things, was the way he so frequently married bleak lyrics about depression and addiction and self-loathing to poppy little tunes as radio-friendly as anything this side of the early 60s Beatles.    So O'Riley's opted here for re-imaginings that somehow capture the trajectory of the original songs while giving them the melancholy feel of Elliot's tragic lyrics and aching voice. (Check out \"I Didn't Understand\" or \"Speed Trials\" or especially the sad scared rumble of \"Independence Day\" if you want to know what I'm talking about.) As usual, O'Riley goes above and beyond the call of duty in scouring the back catalog for songs to play. (If you're like me, that means you might miss \"Pitselah\" but feel comforted that someone out there's a much more devoted and appreciative Elliott Smith fan than you'll ever be.)    It's a shame this sort of thing doesn't happen more often. Then again, there aren't too many modern musicians respectable enough to deserve the O'Riley treatment",

The songs, that is, not the performances. The boys sing and play as well as ever, but their efforts -- particularly some fine Danko vocals and Hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless, charmless and brainless.

The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes a more important live document of the band, indeed.   Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century(the spirited opener School, Bloody Well Right, Hide in Your Shell, Asylum, Dreamer, Rudy and the closing Crime of the Century which closes this live album), three songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (Ain't Nobody But Me, A Soapbox Opera and Two of Us), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments(From Now On and Fool's Overture), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America(the monster hit The Logical Song, the title cut and the Top 20 smash Take The Long Way Home) plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis? What Crisis?.   Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/vocalist Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards, additional backing vocals and band MC(he does the stage bantering here, especially his humorous intro to Breakfast in America), drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion.   Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is played at a faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section.   Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts(going Gold right away) and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album.   Highly recommended!",

He sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed.  He breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back.  This album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me.  On 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits, you listen for the album as you heard it the first time.  The only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion.  Also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle.  This album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into.  Its Lennon breaking the chains from the Beatles and really from himself.  After the 3rd listen, it immediately made sense to me.  Now i cant put it down",

Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap!  There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs.  And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff? If Chicago, with their extensive catalog, even thinks about performing one song from this album live, you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions.

Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask?    The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you.       In \"Jesus Walks\" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality.     Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following \"Jesus Walks\" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with \"foul language\". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree.     He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap.       The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music.      SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (a genre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that.     Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you.

Though each track is distinct and stands well on its own, they all complement one another and play almost seamlessly as a whole. Maybe I'm partial since I first heard Tempest live as the current ensemble of musicians, but I think newcomer violinist Sue Draheim's harmony vocals add a sweet texture the previous album did not have. Then again, there's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads. At any rate, having seen some of Tempest's live performances, I can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy.

Then they released the awesome, their best in my opinion, track Arcadia. After the release of Arcadia, I just thought it couldn't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works. But the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two. And this album just proves it. All of these tracks are well done and finished, but too finished and too uncreative.

The typical \"Gangsta\" has Shiest Bub collaborating with Jim Jones and Max B backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep, the verses are equally boring. Laidback \"Fly High\" follows, backed by some mellow production Purple City pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut. I don't know if Purple City is paying tribute to the South movement, or trying to capitalize on it with \"Trap N****\" either way it's a weak attempt to sound like Young Jeezy, its actually disturbing. \"Go Head\" follows Purple City proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut. \"Nick Nack\" is a lame attempt at a club track, horrible chorus. Tec, Steele and Buckshot drop in for the grimy \"Hustlers\".  Agallah, Un Kasa and affiliate Ike Eyes  team up for another bland cut with \"Picture Me Rollin\". Shiest Bub collabs with A-Mafia on \"Head Bust Open\" rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with Purple City.  Purple City's decides to spell things out again on \"P.A.Y.D.A.Y.\".

Desmond had done a record led by Gerry several years prior, and it was Mulligan's turn to play with Paul on a project he would control. Because of heavy workloads, the two principals collaborated in three separate sessions during June, July and August in New York. Also due to scheduling difficulties, the rhythm section changed at each session. On the six tunes which made the original LP, there are three different bassists and two different drummers. Also on the six LP selections, Desmond did a little studio trickery: some of the improvised solos were put together from different sessions, and on one tune he overdubbed a third saxophone for one verse. If you didn't know this, however, you'd never guess it. The counterpoint improvs of Gerry on baritone and Paul on alto are consistently interesting. Overall the disc is more uptempo than Desmond's other work as a leader. The product lacks that special magic which can often be found on a good recording by a quartet which plays live together and often, but it is a subtle loss. This reissue adds five bonus tracks, including two with guitarist Jim Hall which did not make Desmond's final list for LP inclusion, but which are quite nice. The two leads are highly skilled, and they seemed to like each other a lot and to bring out good things for one another. Not Desmond's best work by a long shot, nor Mulligan's, but worth owning if you are partial to either man. I'm glad BMG is doing these Bluebird First Edition releases from the RCA vaults. The booklets are usually quite good. They come in cardboard cases instead of jewel cases, and I'm not sure if I like that or not yet. Maybe they  could knock a dollar or two off the price and be an even better value, but if, like me, you enjoy the classic jazz of the 1946-'66 generation, you should buy some of these reissues to encourage the company to keep them coming",

            "input": "By far the best Camera Obscura album yet . This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.    Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular \"I Need All the Friends I Can Get\" and the truly sad \"Dory Previn,\" about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary \"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken,\" named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, \"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?\"    All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart",

One of the early Judas Priest albums, here we find Rob Halford's voice slightly different (something that would be complained about 20 years later with the release of an album with the band Two) and starting to change into the voice we hear on albums like \"British Steel\" and \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" All of Glenn Tipton's and KK Downing's signature guitar licks are on here. All the songs are good (there's even a Priest classic...\"Beyond the Realms of Death\") but this album is far from being their best album or even in the same league as albums like \"Hellbent for Leather\" or \"British Steel\". But, don't get me wrong. It's good for an earlier release, but other than that...Get one of their later albums first.    1. Exciter-5/5-Good drum intro. The song is catchy for the most part and Rob Halford does some great screetching in this song.  2. White Heat, Red Hot-4/5-This song's OK, but I think the part where Halford says \"white heat, red hot.\" is annoying.  3. Better By You Better than Me-3/5-His voice sounds more like it did on later albums, but this song doesn't seem really inspired.  4. Stained Class-5/5-Great song! The music on this track in particular rocks.  5. Invader-5/5-This song took a while to grow on me, but it's a very cool song.  6. Saints in Hell-5/5-I like the title and the lyrics. The song has some great sounds.  7. Savage-5/5-This song is really great, Halford's screeching can't be topped on this song.  8. Beyond the Realms of Death-5/5-Probably the best song on here.  9.

Recently, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sampled Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Mary Jane's Last Dance for their funky track, Dani California. Nevertheless, to spin a song of your own, and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic. That is the case for Prince, and his latest single, Fury, the third single from his album 3121. The song samples the opening hook from his 80's track 1999, and takes it into something else. The song actually is good, and delivers a unique feeling of funk, soul & pop. It is a really good track, that still shows that Prince hasn't lost his edge. I found this to be surprisingly upbeat and worth its price. This is a great song, and I hope it gets a lot of good airplay.    Song:",

As an adolescent in the 60s, I, like many of my peers, fell in love with Dusty Springfield.  Forty years later, I listened to this collection, and I am in love with her all over again, only more so.  Her voice was very special.  From the country-style folk of The Springfields, through the romantic standards, to soulful R&B, she could do it all, and all exquisitely.    There are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that I missed first time round.  Listen to the unique phrasing on The Son of a Preacher Man, a song that she made her own, and the delicious seductiveness of Breakfast in Bed (which I heard for the first time on this CD) and you will see what I mean.    Her life had tragedy in it.  In many ways, the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the British tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that Dusty was a lesbian.  This helped destroy her UK career and after that she spent most of her time in the US and the Netherlands.  By nature insecure, she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt.  Just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys and an appearance on the Jools Holland TV show (what a hero that man is; when are we going to have his show highlights on DVD?) she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which ultimately killed her.    Among the divas of twentieth century British popular music, she is supreme, and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the US also.    It was good to hear The Look of Love on the Catch Me If You Can soundtrack.  It will help keep her voice alive for a new generation.  That track is on this CD and is just one gem among many.  They repay close listening.",

            "input": "Sophisticated orchestration, great voice, love the words . This was the most sophisticated popular music that I heard when I was young.  Joshua Rifkin, who also plays piano rags by Scott Joplin on another record, arranged and conducted this music.  \"Both Sides Now\" (win and lose are a strange trip in this song) was a hit on the radio for years, competing with \"Walk Away Renee\" and \"Pretty Ballerina\" by The Left Banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music.  I soon bought THE JUDY COLLINS SONGBOOK with 55 songs that included eight of the songs on \"Wildflower.\"    The first musical thing I notice about these songs now is how often I hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes.  The first song, \"Michael from Mountains\" by Joni Mitchell is in the key of E-flat, with a short introduction that repeats F G F G F G in the treble clef before Judy Collins starts singing those notes.  The second song, \"Since You've Asked\" by Judy Collins, which seems to be in E-minor, starts with an E and D alternating an octave higher over an E-minor7th chord, dropping through B-minor to a C chord with E D E D E D E in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to \"Michael ...\" but with enough G, A sus.4, D9, A-minor7th, and B chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music.  The words on such simple lines, \"Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood, All the willow winding paths leading up and outward, This is what I give . . . \" are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen.    \"Sisters of Mercy\" by Leonard Cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and French horns.  There is certainly more going on than I can describe.  Judy Collins had done \"Suzanne\" on an earlier album, \"In My Life,\" and the combination of Judy singing Leonard Cohen songs worked so miraculously that \"Wildflowers\" took it in a very religious direction.  \"Priests\" has 7 verses, with the third verse:    And who will shoot the arrow  That men will follow through your grace.  And when I'm Lord of memories  And all your armor has turned to lace.    The music seems a lot more complicated than a trill, possibly in B-flat-minor, with the notes between the staffs alternating between B-flat and A-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to C-flat.    If you have never heard \"La Chanson des Vieux Amants\" by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest, you might not realize how sophisticated French popular songs had been before this album pushed American radio up to international standards.  Big bands had been popular once in the United States, and American music during World War II might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer, but I lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that, when Perry Como and Dean Martin could have used a few more hits.  There are some distinct instrumental voices which make the Brel song on \"Wildflowers\" interesting, but Brel often worked with Gerard Jouannest to achieve musical complexity.  So I suspect that this version is notable because Judy Collins' French is so beautiful.  The final song in her songbook, \"My Father,\" (on the \"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\" album) is about \"My father always promised us that we would live in France,\" and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world.  Contemplating intense desire is inspiring, but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly.  \"Oh, mon amour, Mon doux, mon tendre, mon verveilleux amour, ...\"    \"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\" is a beautiful song by Leonard Cohen, soft with sorrow but Hey . .",

The opening track, \"Mr. And Misdemeanor\" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words.  \"Shoe Salesman\", \"Below Your Means\", \"Return Of The Spiders\", and the short but cool \"Refrigerator Heaven\" are all good tunes.  The finale of \"Beautiful Flyaway\" and \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\" is also a great way to end things.  The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release.  \"Easy Action\" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point.",

I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.     Though primarily focused on \"indie\" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies \"This Will Be Our Year\", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's \"Move On\",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic \"Sam Stone\", and the late Elliott Smith's \"A Distorted Reality...\", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the \"acoustic\" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's \"Everything's Ruined\" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of \"Date With The Night\" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause.",

I have listened to every one of their albums serveral times over and this one has came out on top of all of the rest.  In my opinion, the albums from greatest to least are (not counting their greatest hits album):    1. Ignition  2. Self Titled  3. Smash  4. Ixnay on The Hombre  5. Americana  6. Splinter  7. Conspiracy of One    Note that I am judging the album as a whole, and not just by the best songs.  Ignition has not a single \"space filler\" song.  It is a raw, 90's punk rock, consistant album.  Some disagree that this is the best of the bunch and argue that Smash is.  I agree Smash has amazing songs like \"Self-Esteem\", \"Come Out and Play\", \"Gone Away\", and many others that helped boost the Offspring to the mainstream.  But not every song on Smash is absolutely good.    \"Dirty Magic\" is the best song on the CD, if not the best Offspring song of all time.  I think it is overlooked and underrated.  Ignition starts off with Dexter yelling \"F**k\" and shows you were the album goes from then on.  \"Session\" is the first song on the CD and one of the top songs of the CD.  There are many great and catchy songs from then on.  Then hits the more emotional, dark, and mysterious song \"Dirty Magic\".  Then it moves into the drug song on the album which is \"Hypodermic\".  After that comes the pyromaniac loving song, \"Burn it Up\".  \"No Hero\" is also a great example of how the Offsping can turn a simple chug riff into something amazing.  \"L.A.P.D.\" is to Offsping like \"F**k The Police\" is to N.W.A.  Another catchy song comes after that called \"Nothing From Something\".  And what better way to end the CD with a great song like \"Forever And A Day\".    Sure this album is no Sgt. Pepper's, but no one has touched The Beatles.  So I highly reccomend this album to people who have heard the Offspring before.  But if you are just starting to enter the Offspring's world, I would suggest Smash for a better feel.  After you get Ignition and if you really like it, their self titled is right up there with it",

And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that b*tch up,  because I know that's where y'all b*tches is bound to meet up.  Cop killas, all up in they chest, and  I know what to do with that vest, man  Twenty-two shots.  I killa.  You don't wanna f**k with Bone, nigga.  And it really ain't sh*t to pull a trigger on a copper,  'cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down,   'cause I'm goin' down poppin, so motherf**k all coppers,  Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya\"    and the title track creepin on ah come up gives off the vibe of young inner city desperation.especialy in the first verse verse by krayzie bone when he says    \"Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t.\"     also lazie bone's verse echos the same sentiment     \"See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down, steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid. Gotta gauge at my waist that be   spellin' out murder that'll get a nigga locked the cage. Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause. What can   I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullsh*t, but a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store.\"    those verses pretty much sums up this album,so do the verse where bizzy bone said he took his conscience and fried them (with weed) after he robbed someone.    but lets not forget the hit singles like thugish rugish bone wich is bone's signiture song along with tha cross roads.and who can forget for the love of money song wich has great verses from flesh-n-bone(whom is arguably the most overlooked memeber),and the late great eazy-e.    flesh-n-bone- \" Gotta get on the grind  Pop in the clip of my nine  And b*tch if you slip  You hit the chalk and fall in the night time  Gotta get mine  Ain't takin no shorts or no losses  Hop on the phone  Callin' my nigga sin at home  Polishin' that MAC-10 crome  Gotta a lick so bring yo sh*t  Cause once again it's on  To the dome with a fifth of burb  we wig to the curb so we swerve  And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug  And follow the murder for robbin the dopehouse  Smoke jump outta me bong  So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge  I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay  Pullin' in the driveway, Wish spotted the place and quickly  rolled up  Bulldozed through the living room  Hopped out of the car and started to blow up  Buck, Buck, and a kaboom  Me blew all them bodies all over the room  Them doomed\"     bad ass verse from flesh lol,eazy-e comes hard too with this verse    \"Standin' on the corner straight slangin' rocks  Aw sh*t! Here comes the muthaf**kin' cops!  So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree  Makin' sure the muthaf**kas don't see me  Now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah i stuffed 'em   Police on my draws, i had to pause  And yeah, it's still muthaf**k 'em  Now my game is tight, tight as f**k is my game  Easy muthaf**kin E or Eric Wright it's all the same   Now niggas might trip on how I stash my grip  I gotta have it b*tch  For the love of this sh*t  MUTHAF**KA!!\"    what a great verse from eazy-e,and its one of my favorites by him.    i also love the bass heavy down for my thang and i like how the song fades out with bone harmonizing the chorus as the song fades out.the intro with the quintet harmonizing along with down for my thang made me understand the relevence of the term HARMONY in the groups name.and after hearing the aformentioned 2 songs i kinda got the style and the jist of the group.    and in turn i couldn't wait for their follow up.because their sound was so melodic/smooth yet hard edged and hard as nails.it was unlike anything i heard before.i will admit though i too wonder how good this album would have been if it was a full LP instead of a EP.but \"as is\" its a great rap album that gives you only a taste of whats to come from this underrated but legendary group",

After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.     As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.     There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best.",

HOME & AWAY: Norrisman has been around for quite a while, basically since the mid-nineties - enough time to put out a couple of albums as well as several bucketloads of singles - but never really made waves away from Jamaican shores until last year's appropriately titled HOME & AWAY. Ray Stephens' easy listening FLAMES rhythm provided the backdrop for this passionate, pleading love song (as well as Richie Spice's super EARTH ALERT, and Morgan Heritage's lush IN A GHETTO), which met with respectable international success, and now heads up this latest long player from the UK's Greensleeves label. Greensleeves are obviously giving the artist a well-deserved push here, with glossy packaging and great liner photos featuring Norrisman trodding the train yards with a guitar strapped across his back like a Jamaican Woody Guthrie, or something. It's a classy package for sure, and without a doubt, it's a classy record too. The familiar title track leads off, and is matched and even bettered by great cuts like SEH DEM BAD, I'M A FREE MAN, the ganja lover's HERBS TO YOUR NERVE, and the bubbling ARMAGEDDON ON. The reliable Lutan Fyah (another recent Greensleeves mover with his excellent PHANTOM WAR album) shows up for the decent combination tune, AFTER ALL, but other than that, it's all Norrisman all the way, and to his credit, he carries it off without so much as a misstep. Most of the production credit goes to Byron Murray and his In The Streetz outfit, and the backup is bright and lively throughout, with a very tangible - and very welcome -  old school one-drop vibe. The only real detour is the Delly Ranks-produced MOVE HARD on the RED BULL & GUINNESS rhythm, which just shows that Norrisman is as comfortable up at the edge of the bump as he is with the roots and lovers material. HOME & AWAY is a very strong release, and along with PHANTOM WAR, one of the best rootswise long players of the year so far.     Next up on the roots release schedule is Mr. Perfect's debut, GIDDIMANI. Look out for this one - it could be another contender!",

His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted.

The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of \"Thunderstorms and Neon Signs\" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.     Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album.

There is no &quot;modern&quot; jazz here. It is also a self-admitted limited survey, due to the label. Men like Ben Webster and Johnny Hodges are not represented due to the fact that no solos from any Decca, or Decca owned subsidiary, were deemed proper examples of either. But what is included is always classic, even if not the most obvious candidate for the artist. Making up for any shortcomings in that regard is the 79 page booklet included, which is really half the presentation.

I bought my first John & Yoko album in 1969 (\"Life with the Lions.\") I got \"ripped off,\" although I should have know better..  I was smart enough not to buy \"Two Virgins\" because of the bad reviews.  I bought \"Life with the Lions\" without reading any reviews, but I was young, naive, and a big Lennon fan.  Oh well!    The John & Yoko albums released before the breakup of the Beatles were all pretty much the same.  The chief instigator of these albums seems to be Yoko.  Her background in the \"avant garde\" and \"conceptual art\" is apparent in these albums.  The basic premise is: take a \"concept\" and run with it.  Keep running with it for as long as possible.  Let's hear John & Yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour.  Let's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate.  After all, the big joke is that John Lennon's name is on this album... so even if the \"concepts\" are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will BUY this piece of vinyl because a Beatle has his name on the cover!!!    \"The Wedding Album\" was the BIGGEST rip-off I ever experienced as a Beatles fan and purchaser of all things Beatle.  When this album came out in 1969 it was priced HIGHER than a regular album because it was a big box!  The graphics for this product HAD to cost more than the recording costs.  The recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish.  Feel like hearing John & Yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour?  Feel like hearing \"home audio\" of every inane bit of their \"bed-in for peace?\"  I sometimes think the most \"conceptual\" thing John & Yoko could've done with this project would have been giving the customer an EMPTY box!  It probably would've sounded better.      Buying the CD version of \"The Wedding Album\" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.

Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.

Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...\"E Pro\" and \"Girl\".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.    During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with \"Earthquake Weather\".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being \"meh\" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!    The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the \"Hey! Guero!\" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!

            "input": "Marvellous fun and great singing . I have to say that I prefer Handel's Tamerlano for musical reasons. However, Vivaldi's opera on the same subject is very enjoyable and entertaining. Like it has been said of the operas of Haydn, Vivaldi's operas are not great operas, but they do contain great music.    Europa Galante, directed from the 1st violin by Fabio Biondi, is in great form and I've never heard them play better. I have their older recording of Handel's opera Poro, and I enjoyed that one, too.   The singers here are an excellent ensemble. I like the dark and expressive voice of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo - he was also marvellous as Leporello in Gardiner's Don Giovanni. David Daniels is fantastic, as usual, and he is possibly the best operatic countertenor in the world at the moment. Patrizia Ciofi is best heard and not seen - sweet voice coming from a madwoman (check out the DVD!). Vivica Genaux has been hyped to within a centimetre of her life recently. She has a nice flexible mezzo voice. A little too much vibrato for my tastes and she looks like a chipmunk when she attacks coloratura passages. Marijana Mijanovic sings well - she was excellent as the neurotic Penelope in the Christie / L.A.F. DVD of Monteverdi's Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. She is alarmingly thin - possible health problems? She doesn't engage with the conductor or orchestra at all in the DVD - the only singer who doesn't. Elina Garanca looks beautiful (and healthy!) and sings beautifully. She has a lovely contralto voice. I hope I see and hear more from this artist in the future.     I am not a big fan of Vivaldi's operas - I enjoy them as collections of arias. I wonder how well Bajazet worked on stage?  I'd love to have a DVD of this production, I would like to see how a Vivaldi opera works on stage. Vivaldi's operas don't have imaginative scorings and the orchestral passages are fairly prosaic. A lot of what goes on in the Vivaldi operas I've heard (I have a few in my CD collection) is pretty routine. However, I am open minded on the subject and I would like to see how well a Vivaldi opera works on stage.",

Kind of like trying to follow  Stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase.  Maybe he (Gil Evans) made it, maybe the other reviewers are right, and it's all great stuff, but it lost me.  No magic, no startles, no surprises that I could suck into my soul and thrive on.      So, be warned, be cautious.  It's a change, and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career, and if you loved \"Individualism\", you might not make the jump.

Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).     2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.

My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single \"song\" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review.  ------------------------------------------------------------    Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like \"Drop a gem on them\" and \"Bloodsport\" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.    I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost",

Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness.

Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...   I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy.",

Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle \"Parklife\", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.     But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.    The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like \"This Is a Low\" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.    It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish",

Having made RCA millions of dollars with PILLOW, the Airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the Sixties.    Listening to AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is literally a trip. Bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques, sound montages, and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination. Everything goes, and so it went at BAXTER'S. It was all new, avant-garde to excess, and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential.     Most art does fail, but there's no question that BAXTER'S cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles. The influence of BAXTER'S can be heard in \"Revolution 9\" by The Beatles, and on many other recordings of the era. BAXTER'S may have sold poorly, but it was heard by the Airplane's contemporaries, and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration. An aficionado's album, AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today.",

Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.    I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.    Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better",

No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on \"Transformer\", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for \"Best of\" compilations. Songs like \"Caroline Says\" and \"How Do Think it Feels\" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most  successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation.     The \"Berlin\" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially \"Lady Day\" ( Kurt Weil ).    The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks.

It was at a local club a few years later. This song has not only a KILLER beat that ANYONE can dance to, but KILLER lyrics, singers, and that it was produced by Prince himself - so naturally this song WAS a winner. Still is. It rocks, baby. And I PROUDLY have several copies on CD, cassette AND mp3. A little obsessed perhaps???? Not really. But this literate one-hit-wonder was an indeed dance-club classic, similar to Eddie Murphy's dance hit class one-hit-wonder \"Party all the Time\".  I love singing along to this hit song. And the singers are sharp, focused, and are actually VERY GOOD VOCALISTS.

Well iv read through a few reviews now, some good, some totaly wierd and none understanding, some dont know what they'v even on about but i read the review by G FUNKINN which i think is 3rd down. im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend.    i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. ..     i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album \"tear drops and closed caskets\"     the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song    the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.    in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out.     3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. \" small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets\".     the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it.        In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment.  the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.       after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.    what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets    i actualy rate this 5 stars im not sure why it's only put a 1 star rating? ? ?",

I have had this tremendous album for years and it is still fresh to me to this day.  It is easily one of my favorite albums, and I have a lot of music.  The album is awesome, consistent yet not generic. It hits you hard with bone-crunching guitar powered anthems (Sweet Thistle Pie, Nothing to Believe In, 100 Flower Power Maximum), then loosens up with catchy Crackeresque sarcastic songs (How Can I Live Without You, Useless Stuff) and then blows your mind with blissfully mellow thought-provoking tunes that sound out of a western ghost town (Bicycle Spaniard, Big Dipper).  The core of Cracker was and always will be David Lowery and Jon Hickman - other members have come and gone - yet not missed that much.  The Golden Age saw Cracker at an all time high when coming off their stupendous predecessor album, the platinum &quot;Kerosene Hat,&quot; which featured the hits &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Eurotrash Girl.&quot;  Some may feel that this album does not live up to Kerosene's greatness, yet others like myself, find this album even better and more consistent.  This is a true great American band that has never quite gotten their due, and they should be recognized for bringing back fond memories of classic-rock bands like the Heartbreakers, the Byrds, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and even the great Neil Young with their tunes.  If you have not heard The Golden Age, or Cracker for that matter, you are missing out - so what are you waiting for?.  There have been so many flash in the pan bands as well as the other drek that fills our radio airwaves lately. A band like Cracker is truly a breath of fresh air and originality to the true &quot;music&quot; fan, not just some sampled, generic, over-the-hill, bubble gum, or boy band shlock that makes me want to puke.  The opening track, I Hate My Generation, speaks volumes to me about what is going on in the music industry these days: corporate greed.  This album, The Golden Age, in the words of Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel, truly goes to 11.  Five stars out of five - a classic",

I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.    By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book \"Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music.\" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana.

            "input": "if you have even a passing interest in Ambient music.... . For an artist that has helped shape the musical map since the 70's, and remained a sterling producer, and also has a album workrate to put most musicians to shame, it's truly surprising that Brian Eno, has so many absolutely essential albums to his name.    Here we concentrate on the period where he Created/Produced a series of defining 'Ambient' albums in the mid-late 70's, that although not the first to produce ambient albums, mastered the form to such a degree, that some 20-30 years on, these albums are frequently referenced, when discussing the genre.   Although as much an electronic album as it is an ambient album, the mood here is one of detached sounds, restrained instruments and a slightly Eerie, and atmospheric solitude.  using a system of two reel-to-reel tape recorders, and making the (relatively) simple process of layering sounds on top of one another, Eno was able to make stark simple sounds, from such instruments as...keyboard, synth, organ, but layer them in such a way that although the music rarely changes direction, it's beauty comes in the form of its simplicity.  The first track...the epic \"Discreet Music\" is really nothing more than a melancholic & slight sounding relaxation drone.  But its what Eno does with the sound and the use of spacial sound, that truly makes this impressive.   Brief compositions of synth are gradually brought in and out of the mix, and although most listeners won't realise it on the first listen, but the relation of these elements changes over time, albeit it very gradually, and coupled with the subtle use of noise and resonance, it reveals a sound of soothing 'ambience' that washes over the listener.    The \"Three Variations on the Canon in D Major\" is more consistent with the stylisation of 'Classical' music, with it less akin to 'Ambient' music, and more in keeping with the compositional elegance and arrangement of piano led orchestration.  which has a  rather melancholy and restless feel to it, and the tone of the strings/piano feels vastly different to the synth-led first track, and its arguably the more immediate track, due to its more noticeable increase in volume/tempo, and although a more rounded sound, still remains very delicate and gentle.  In fact imagine these beautifully crafted tracks as works for soundtracks  for films that were never filmed, as it's deeply beguiling and littered with the romanticism that became a trademark in Eno's series of 'Ambient' Albums.  As it's all so precisely performed and tremendously realised, that one can't help but fall in love with this incredible album.   If you picked up any of Eno's other 'Ambient' albums, I really can't stress enough, how utterly recommended this album comes, It's not only considered one of his finest 'Ambient' albums, but also just a truly exceptional album regardless of the genre.

This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording.    Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe..    Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.    Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural.    The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant.     This is some masterpiece material. A truly excellent CD",

            "input": ".........cosmic . I guess \"Bible of Dreams\", Juno Reactor's bold foray into territory beyond their techno days, contains the best sounds. Aw, who am I kidding? It's the greatest album in the history of the universe!!!    1) Jardin de Cecile - 4/5. You might call it boring; I call it moody. This is not the standard \"calm & slow\" sound of Juno Reactor--in other words, it's not a droning, monotonous pile of neverending bull. This one actually has character, which is maybe not as evident in the first couple of minutes as it is later. We get some atmospheric, echoing notes that have a nice, dreamy quality to them. After a while, percussion joins in, along with this weird \"sweeping\" noise that pops in every few seconds. About five minutes in, the song undergoes a complete change of style and transforms to heavy percussion and a little synth. A nice intro that gives you a taste of things to come. It's like the POV of someone gradually waking up and joining the traffic jam of everyday life. While stoned.    2) Conga Fury - 4/5. You may have heard this in \"The Animatrix\" or \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" (so sorry for mentioning that movie). It starts off with a lone female voice whose harmonizing is soon joined by jungle drums and synth. It continues on with the drums and the synth and the voice until it quiets down and ends the same way it began. And what's really funny is the male voice that kicks in at two minutes. It's somewhat weird and out of place, but it's so hilarious that I can forgive Watkins. \"Huela! Huela! Libalalibalalibalalibala...\" Or whatever he's saying.    3) God is God - 5/5. It's funny. When I first heard \"Pistolero\", I thought that no other Juno Reactor song could ever be as good or better. Kids today, eh? Whatever melancholy quietude existed in the first two songs is completely gone here. We've left the jungle and entered the desert, and does it deliver. Don't be fooled by the spacy sound at the beginning--that soon gives way to a crazy beat with chanting and all the instruments you'd expect in the Middle Eastern culture. There are also sound clips apparently taken from \"The Ten Commandments\", which are weird at first and then as cool as the rest of the song. Sure, it's repetitive, but the main tune is WAY awesome, and as long as we have that...repetition matters not, grasshopper.    4) Komit - 4/5. Not bad at all. A remix of this was heard early on in \"The Matrix Reloaded\", and I must admit, I liked it better there. It begins with a series of notes that give one a sense of flying through the calm night air. I would've liked to hear these notes become more prominent, but alas, only in \"Reloaded\". Here, they stay in the background and let the Juno percussion take over. The song just gets bizarre at times, although the grungy tunes are worth it. That's about all. Overall, this is a more organic version of something you'd hear in \"Transmissions\".    5) Swamp Thing - 4/5. Ah, looks like they're tackling heavy metal. This starts off grungy and gritty, and doesn't let up until it's over. The usual percussion kicks in, and sticks with a sinister tempo for a while. When we hear the guitar solos at approximately 3:30, it seems kinda belated and anticlimactic, especially since they don't go much further than that; we slip right back to the percussion. I'm only giving this a 4 because it's rather catchy.    6) Kaguya Hime - 5/5. This can be compared to \"Swamp Thing\", but it takes itself a lot less seriously. It's got a similar setup and form: percussion accompanied by minimal synth. About forty seconds in, we're introduced to a very playful beat that sounds like the work of hollow drums played by chopsticks. Or something like that. Midway through, the drums \"mature\" into a heavier-sounding variety, with some more synth playing alongside than before. It's still playful, though. In fact, this is a very fun song to listen to if you don't mind a drum being the primary instrument. Reminds me of the final segment of \"Jardin\". I'm only giving this a 5 because it's supremely catchy.    7) Children of the Night - 5/5. And now for something completely different. While the previous six have different styles, one can tell that they're all Juno Reactor works. With this, it might be a little more difficult. At least for me. On the platter is a tune that sounds evil yet fun. Shall we say...giddy. It's very, very giddy. You can imagine an evil force approaching to kill you, but messing with your mind first by sneaking up on you from multiple directions, or filling your mind with images from your worst nightmares. It is giddy. There's not a lot of ways to describe it. Giddiness all around. \"The children of the night are call-eeng...hehehehe...hehehehe...\" accompanied by the sound of puppies allegedly whimpering before their horrible, gas-filled deaths. Brrr. Did I mention it's giddy?    8) Shark - 4/5. I know, I know, it's \"calm & slow\". But it's also not monotonous. If you haven't figured out from the title, this conveys an underwater feeling to the listener. It's very mellow and trancy, and in some parts, definitely reminiscent of Vangelis' opening score for \"Blade Runner\". It's down-time for the entire song, although there is a rough patch that's supposed to resemble a tectonic plate breaking apart or something. Ruins the calmness, I think. The length is another problem; it's over nine-and-a-half minutes long. When a song doesn't have a lot of musical variety, you might wanna shorten it. On the plus side, featured here are a bunch of trippy sound effects that sound underwater-ish, but I don't really know why. Without these sounds, this song is what you'd hear at one of those big aquarium display shows. With the sounds, it's...well...Juno Reactor at its calm & slow finest.    9) High Energy Protons (Orion Mix) - 5/5. I'm fully aware it's a remix. I'm fully suspicious of the guys for being lazy. But that doesn't stop the \"Bible\" finale from ruling. To make it easier for you, I'll just assume that you've already listened to the original version in \"Transmissions\". And by \"easier for you\", I mean \"easier for myself\". Some of the techno sound is still here, but the background choir holds much more presence. Furthermore, there's the addition of a few synth riffs that add another dimension to the whole thing. However, I still like the original mix better. Don't ask why. And if you're wondering about the dialogue clips, they've dropped \"You're going to have a wonderful trip.\" All we've got here is \"You're the brain and central nervous system\", \"High energy protons spilling over into our atmosphere\", and \"Everything's going extremely well.\" (YES! HAL-9000!!!",

A huge achievement by a band that continues to produce excellent music despite a huge amount of criticism from fans of Cavalera-era Sepultura.    It's surprising that people can't get over the fact that Max Cavalera left a whole decade ago. Since then Sep have moved on and I doubt they would have made Dante XXI had Max still been at the helm. Frankly, bands should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of themselves and their fans. If you follow a band, it's sometimes worth having a little faith in them, I feel. I guess we fall in love with a band after hearing a couple of albums and that those albums become the band. But the band themselves have a totally different perspective! The music they produce is a product of the dynamics of the members of the band, their abilities, relative strengths, experience, musical preferences etcetera. All of these factors can change over time; indeed SHOULD change over time. Hence, aspects of Sep's music have changed also. How sad would it be to say that Sepultura had learnt nothing new in the last 10 years? That their music had been influenced by nothing that has happened to them? Why would anyone want them to keep copying the sound of their earlier work? Would you really want Sepultura to just regurgitate Arise and Chaos AD tracks? Wouldn't that just put them on a par with bands like Status Quo? How utterly tragic that would be.    When playing live, they play a huge number of older songs because they know we want to hear them too. So, if you want older stuff, don't expect it on a new album - go see them live. They're better live than on a disc any day!    Dante XXI is certainly more consistently thrashy than their other post-Cavalera output. (So, if you've been missing that aspect of Sepultura: here it is!) Green's vocals are awesome; there are terrific riffs and fantastic rhythm. It's hard to pick a favourite, but if pressed, I'd recommend you listen to 'Fighting On' - and turn it up VERY LOUD!    With Dante XXI, Sepultura continue to successfully broaden the musical boundaries of both themselves and their fans.    So, set aside your preconceptions and give this album a good listen - you'll love it.",

They had a bona fide producer in Kay Gee (Naughty by Nature), incredible vocal chemistry, heavy-duty promotion, and catchy singles. This resulted in an impressive debut. So why the snub? I guess that will always be a mystery. Anywho, along with Blackstreet and Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number, Pronounced Jah-Nay ranks as one of the top five BEST hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994. And here's why.    It was a very cohesive record, consisting of FIVE R&B entries, with \"Hey Mr. D.J.\", \"Groove Thang\", and \"Sending My Love\" making the top five. You think that's the story? NOT!. The story is how good the REST of the album is. In fact, I will say (like other VERY strong debuts) that the album tracks are BETTER than the singles. And that's saying a lot, given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990's. Those tracks are: \"Sweet Taste of Love\", \"Changes\", \"La La La\", \"For A Reason\" and \"Hey Mr. D.J. Remix\". That's eight cuts that should get played everytime it's in the CD player. It doesn't get much better than that.    In sum, Zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records. However, their fame didn't last long. They would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set. But their debut will never be forgotten. It's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh. And that's what makes it irresistibly catchy.

Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was \"Snowflake.\"  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record",

I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years.

Being a newer fan to Anti-Flag and only catching their albums (The Terror State and For Blood and Empire) I will admit my ignorance along the lines of their earlier work with what little I know of it.    Something that I have noticed with a large majority of the negative reviews about this album is how they view the political aspects of the album and of the band, as well.  Is this not a cd?  Does the cd not have MUSIC.  How about having a critic on just the music itself like how many of the songs have strong messages and I've been hearing some impressive bass parts along with very catchy songs.    I don't know who Crass is and I don't care.  It's all a matter of opinion and if you don't like the album, that's your deal.  I think it's pretty solid.    Though, I will say this.  Something that I have never liked about Anti-Flag is their music is so limited.  You can only write so many songs about the same topic before it gets old.  Something that I have always appreciated with bands is versatility with writing songs.  So far from what I've heard, it's just all politics... though that is the path that Anti-Flag has chosen to take and they have stuck with it ever since.  So kudos to them",

But this CD left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so. It has some of the most well-crafted SY songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest, sublime, fuzzed out guitar sounds ever.   Track 1 is the perfect song. Track 2 (Junkie's Promise) rocks harder than anything they've ever done. They played it on Conan Obrien and tore it up!!! Track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way. This is the track that first reeled me in as I was under the influence of Wild Irish Rose watching my friends play Tekken 2. Track 4 (washing machine) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing. Kim Gordon's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'Little Trouble Girl' and 'Panty Lies'. How can any true fan of alternative music hate this CD? Good experimentation with noise and distortion, yet structured songs... better than previous \"Expermmental Jet Set\" album. Give it a whir",

Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse.  Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull.  Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience",

While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest \"Definitive Collection\" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc.

Steely classics such as \"Do It Again\", \"Reelin' In The Years\", \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\", \"Black Friday\", \"Deacon Blues\", \"Peg\" and \"Hey Nineteen\" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day.  While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic \"Josie\". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including \"Josie\" and dropping a track like, say \"Dirty Work\" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.   Apart from this, Steely Dan's \"Definitive Collection\" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation \"Show Biz Kids\" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more.",

This track doesn't follow Alanis' standard songwriting formula and is a bit scattered. Nonetheless, a great song. 4/5    2. BENT FOR YOU - Excellent alt/rock effort. This is the song that opens the DVD portion of \"Feast On Scraps\". Excellent. 5/5    3. SORRY TO MYSELF - This is a spine tingling ballad. Perhaps, dare I say, Alanis' best ballad. This song definitely should have been released as a single. 5/5    4. SISTER BLISTER - This one's a monster rocker! As well as the previous track, this would have been so successful as a single. Not since \"You Oughta Know\" has Alanis produced such a great rock track. Would have been a huge hit on the Modern Rock Charts. 5/5    5. OFFER - Another ballad here, however, this one falls incredibly short. While Alanis' voice is good, nothing seems to come together and the lyrics and music are to say the least, boring. 2/5    6. UNPRODIGAL DAUGHTER - Another great rock track. It's about Alanis leaving home for L.A. to start her new life. We see a hint of the \"angry\" Alanis we say on \"Jagged Little Pill\", maybe because this song is referring back to that time. 5/5    7. SIMPLE TOGETHER - I believe this song was the song sent to radio stations to promote \"Feast On Scraps\". It most definitely was a poor choice. While it is an ok ballad, it's somewhat dull. 3/5    8. PURGATORYING - This song is magical! It's a very enjoyable and definitely interesting song. There's almost an otherworldly feel to this. From watching this song being performed on the DVD of \"Feast On Scraps\", it's easy to see the magic of this track comes from the live performance. Nonetheless, great! 4/5    9. HANDS CLEAN(ACOUSTIC) - It's really nice to hear this 2002 hit stripped down to the core. Sounds great. 4/5    DVD Overview:    The full concert on this DVD follows Alanis though her 2002 \"Toward Our Union Mended Tour\" Most of the footage is from her Rotterdam show. It's loaded with hits, precious rarities and brand new tracks! Alanis has such raw, pure energy in her shows. Most notibly on tracks such as \"Purgatorying\", \"You Oughta Know\", \"Flinch\", \"Sympathetic Character\" and \"Uninvited\". This DVD shows us at times the rewarding and struggling process of songwriting in and out of the studio. Contains superb behind the scenes footage showing us Alanis' humorous and wacky side. It's also an excellent facet to understand her and her philosophy to a much greatest extent. 5/5    Overall:     I actually rate this album 4.2 out of 5 stars. \"Feast On Scraps\" is a great experience for any lover of live music! A great buy!",

The true Warren Zevon was a poet of sorts, a man who tackled difficult subjects (\"Excitable Boy,\" for example, with a final verse that still gives me shivers), but still remained a sensitive man at heart (\"Accidentally Like a Martyr,\" for example; don't deny, it moves you).    From the you-know-what hitting the fan in \"Lawyers Guns and Money,\" to the purely delightful recitation of \"I Need a Truck,\" to the heart-wrenching \"Tule's Blues,\" to the rockin' romp of \"Nighttime in the Switching Yard,\" to the world's most famous undead Thompson-gun toting anti-hero in \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,\" EXCITABLE BOY remains a rock 'n roll classic.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's a staple rock album.  It is by far wittier and more creative than most rock albums ever produced; sure, there aren't too many screaming electric guitars (oh my God, is that guy playing a PIANO???), but EXCITABLE BOY is quite simply one of the best rock albums ever made.

This guy is one of the best singers on the planet, though and this cd is still one of the best that the Counting Crows have ever produced.  Okay, well, the guitar sounds are much more raw, very retro and vintage sounding, I wouldn't be suprised if every guitar, amp, and effects pedal are 30+ years old.  My favorite songs are definitely Raining in Baltimore (amazing quiet version), Long December, Have You Seen me Lately?, Recovering the Satelites, and Round Here. If you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff. I've heard Adam's voice coompared with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20.

I'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid.  Guests are mostly to thank for that, as well as some great production (that he always seems to pull off).

            "input": "A Classic Death Cab Album . Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.  Recommended.",

I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).    Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.     Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.    The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.    If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2",

My equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price.  To this day, I have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine  (Yes I am biased!).  High end does not mean excellent sound because I tried to listen to well known brands and I could not get satisfied with the sound.    I believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier  specs that only two manufacturers still specify. Slew rate and damping factor.  One is Australian and the other Swiss.  I have the Australian brand to beat.  Speakers  and interconnects are secondary but to me, electrostatic speakers are king! SACD players that are mid range suffice",

I disagree with the spotlight reviewer's assertion that this movie-musical was overproduced; it seems more to suffer from Spartan-like efforts in production.

But enough about the movie, this is the soundtrack...and as I stated above, it's a mess.  This classification mainly rests on the shoulders our \"Diva Supreme\" Diana Ross.  Stephanie Mills set the bar high, and Miss Ross did not even come CLOSE to that standard.  She was a visible, vocal and emotional failure.  Her renditions of \"Be a Lion\" and Home\" (my favorite two songs} were dreadful--in the latter she even sang incorrect lyrics.  She just does not have the talent or ability to effectively communicate Dorothy's character, let alone sing her songs right.  I would rate this with ZERO stars if it were at all possible.  However, the two stars are earned by the members of the original cast (especially Mabel King) and one addition: Ms. Lena Calhoune Horne.  She was radiant in voice and appearance and brought the level of inspiration and power up a notch as she belted out \"Believe in Yourself\".  They alone save this movie and album from just being a total misstep.  Yet, we still have Diana Ross here absolutely slaughtering the vocals and pathos of Dorothy, so all-in-all it's just a mess",

When standard tunes from the American Songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public, music that could once be called \"experimental\" or \"avant garde\" necessarily defines the modern mainstream. If there are similarities with early landmark recordings (e.g. Miles Davis' 70s fusion groups),  \"Lawn Chair Society\" would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous, more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears.    Aside from electronics and musical synthesis, three qualities in particular stand out about this music: composition is emphasized above improvisation; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention (both of which require a standard repertoire); tonal colors, dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with Duke Ellington, before the \"bebop revolution.\"    Lest any listeners require the \"jazz\" label to enjoy this music, Kenny Werner has called on the A Team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces. The trumpet of Dave Douglas and bass clarinet of Chris Potter descend on \"Lo's Garden\" like a busy, darting pair of humming birds (joined at the hip, naturally). Soon a more vegetative pace is established by Scott Colley's firmly grounded bass while Brian Blade's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels. Meanwhile, Werner's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound, moving from prepared piano to phased Fender wahs, with a dab of string synth for highlighting.    \"Burble_burble_spleek\" is as onomatopoeic as the title--wind chimes, telephone rings and Douglas playing some of the most vocalized (and intestinal) trumpet sounds this side of Clark Terry and Rex Stewart. \"Uncovered Heart,\" a calming guitar-like ballad in E Major, is soon followed by the ambitious title number-- a collage of funked-up chatter, vocalized demagoguery by each horn player, some thoughtful discourse by Werner on piano, a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns, and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters (certainly not a reference to a familiar White House-Halliburton figure?).  Closure comes not with a bang but with \"Loss,\" essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings, followed by \"Kothbiro,\" an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple African melody.    In conclusion, if \"Kind of Blue\" and Bill Evans' Vanguard Sessions are in your blood, this one is unlikely to replace either one.  All the same, it's well-conceived, smartly-executed, cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz",

Generally, there's a stripped down sensibility musically, and less purely goofy lyrics.    Partly, this is due to the opening \"Who Do You Think We Are,\" which presents a rather oblique look, perhaps, at special forces.  The music is very stripped down--no, extremely stripped down compared to \"Welcome to my Nightmare\" or \"Goes to Hell\" or all of his later metal albums--it's as if Alice is getting in touch with his inner garage here.  Vocally, Alice provides his usual range of dark sneers, wide-eyed irony, and generally witty lyrics.  Certainly a promising start.    \"Seven & Seven Is\" (a cover) rattles along continuously with a snare drum, with jangly distortion guitars, occasional electronic flourishes, and Alice pretty much resorting to straight-up growly voice throughout. Hard though not to like an energetic song that declares, \"Oom Beh Beh Oom Beh Beh yea.\"    \"Prettiest Cop on the Block,\" as the name suggests is a transvestite policeman tale.  Definitely shot through with machismo, this is no limp-wristed rendition.  \"I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock. My kids are confused, and my wife is in shock.\" The vocals are the growls as previously--the I've-been-drinking-and-smoking-too-much gravel kind of voice.  The music is a bit uninspired, particularly the drums. The novelty of the song wears out in fairly short order.    \"Don't Talk Old to Me\" manages to vary things musically, finally. A fairly deft combination of kind of heavy-handed guitar and lyrics set next to a chorus that features keyboards and a number of layered dialoguing vocal lines.  The lyrics, of course, have a certain cleverness as an adult obviously complains about being told to give up all his toys, such as guns and cars.  There are more musical details and variation in this song than the previous ones--the particular combination of comedy and seriousness here is pretty convincing.    \"Generation Landslide `81\" is a reprise of the lyrically excellent tune from \"Billion Dollar Babies\" (the tune, in fact, that gives us the phrase \"billion dollar babies\"). A military-march style snare kicks along, as simple guitar chords back up Alice's cultural rant, and adds a verse or two to the original.  One of the effects of this song is to point out some of the less inspired aspects of the rest of the disc, but that doesn't mean one isn't glad for it being here. Energetic, socially incisive Alice.    \"You Want It, You Got It\" let's out Alice's inner used car salesman, as he vocally sleazes his way through this either brilliant send up of the worst of New Wave music, or a rather unfortunate example of it. Cheesy keyboards and ham-fisted drum machine, many years later this song sounds so dated that it almost ceases to be dated.  If this song really tickles your fancy, then \"Zipper Catches Skin\" will be a treasure trove for you as this is definitely a prequel of that album to come.  Harmless cheese, one may not expect \"cute\" from Alice, but here you are.    \"You Look Good in Rags\" returns to a more traditional rock ensemble, guitar lead and all. This workaday rocker never really quite stands up, even with the semi-barbershop acapella section of \"rags rag rags\" toward the end, clipping scissors effect and all.  The non-stellarness of it does not mean that it's hopelessly boring. It's kind of good, harmless fun--it's just, one doesn't expect this sort of thing from Alice.    \"You're a Movie\" is a ridiculous cheeky monologue by a would be heroic general type. The music is thoroughly 80s, guitar tone and gacky keyboards all.  And, in fact, the chorus that chants, \"You're a movie\" is completely dead and unspirited. So what makes this pure novelty song ever-fresh, ever-delightful and really very funny are Alice's intercut remarks.  They say that in comedy timing is everything, and Alice shows that he's got it in spades here.  Technically a pretty awful song, one cannot help digging the wily wit Alice puts out.    The last track, \"Vicious Rumours\" provides that obligatory Alice song about public perception. The vocals here draw out the snideness more. One wishes (throughout the album) that the drums were set back more in the mix, and the guitars brought forward, but there's more energy in this particular rocker than most of the rest of the album.    So, overall one can hardly recommend this album without qualifications, especially if you are getting here by way of his first band, or by his later work, like \"Brutal Planet\".  As a kind of essay in cheese, and sheer low-fi production goofiness--and particularly of a sound that is glued immovably to the 80s--then you might enjoy this. Again, the import price is awfully steep for such a short disc.  A used copy seems a better way to go.",

Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the \"Jamming With Edward\" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)     Ry said the Stones \"stole\" his sound and riffs. He said \"Honky Tonk Woman\" was an example of this \"ripoff.\" In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.    Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called \"devil\" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered \"satanic.\"    Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.     I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company.",

Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.

When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality",

While Neil has written and recorded a wealth of outstanding material throughout his career, his albums have tended to be a bit uneven.  Perhaps that's why there are so many Neil Diamond compilation albums on the shelf these days.  This collection culls the best selections from his late 60s and early 70s UNI/MCA albums.  In fact, this set is essentially an expanded version of the now out-of-print His 12 Greatest Hits.  And while that album supplanted the studio versions of Sweet Caroline and Holly Holy with strong live versions from Hot August Night, this collection restores the original studio recordings.  Hot August Night, Neil's last MCA album before leaving for Columbia, is represented with the stellar live version of Cherry, Cherry.  But as good as that version is, I would have dropped it (along with the cover of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother) for Cold Water Morning, Glory Road and Two-Bit Manchild.  That's a minor quibble though, as this set does contain all of the essential recordings from the period in breathtakingly pristine sound quality.    Several reviewers have complained about the lack of certain songs (Heartlight, Kentucky Woman, Thank the Lord for the Night Time, etc.).  For the record, this is a compilation of Neil's best work from his UNI/MCA recording era (1968-1972).  The early singles (Thank the Lord for the Night Time, Kentucky Woman, Solitary Man and the original studio version of Cherry, Cherry) were recorded for Bang Records in 1966 and 1967.  The best collection of the early Bang Records material is Classics: The Early Years.  America and Love on the Rocks were recorded for Capitol while most later era songs like September Morn, If You Know What I Mean and Heartlight were recorded for Columbia (beginning with the Jonathan Livingston Seagull album in 1973).  The best single-disc collection of Neil's Columbia material is probably 12 Greatest Hits, Volume II.  Fans interested in purchasing a career spanning retrsopective may be tempted to buy Greatest Hits 1966-1992 or The Essential Neil Diamond but both of those compilations suffer from the inclusion of inferior live versions of in place of the original studio recordings.  The career spanning box set, In My Lifetime, largely avoids the live version replacement issue that plagues other compilations but it suffers from its own share of problems, namely an abundance of mildly interesting (but ultimately unnecessary) rarities.    The most efficient method of compiling your own triple disc, career spanning box set is to purchase these three titles: Classics - The Early Years [Neil's Bang Records recordings from 1966-1967], The Neil Diamond Collection [the UNI/MCA sampler reviewed above], and 12 Greatest Hits Volume II [the best of the Capitol and Columbia years].",

But looking at the songs themselves-- \"The Day The World Went Away\" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  \"Starf***ers, Inc\" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.

The challenge was daunting, being limited to approximately 15 tracks.      Four tracks came from this wonderful CD.  Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, \"Girl In The Red Dress\" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, \"First Flight Home\" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, \"Corner Club\" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, \"Isabella\".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks \"what exactly is smoothjazz?\"  Play \"Isabella\" for them.  They'll understand.

I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:    1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and    2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.    My thoughts on both:    The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.    The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.      All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to \"The Hawk\" just TEARS!!!    I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.    I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.    Take their self titled album (or \"Lysol\" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.    So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like \"A Senile Animal\" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.    So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.    And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.        As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?    Its inhuman",

But I needn't have worried, the sound is great, and the performance is energetic and fun, with a verse in Creole thrown in for good measure.  &quot;This Shirt&quot; is probably my favorite track I was unfamiliar with, but the entire album is quality; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where I can say I enjoyed every song.

Predating the whole pop-metal explosion of the later 80's by a few years, Def Leppard's 1983 masterpiece \"Pyromania\" still is a shining of how metal sensibilities can successfully merge with pop to create something that has integrity, substance and not an inkling of self parody (which Def Leppard would end up falling prety to themselves in a few short years after this album).    I became a Def Leppard fan with their 1981 album High 'n' Dry but Pyromania took things to an entirely different level.    The songwriting in particular stands as some of the best and catchiest of the 80's (or any decade for that matter).  The band never sounded better and this was the last album for a while that drummer Rick Allen would play an acoustic kit on as he hadn't had his tragic 1984 car wreck yet in which he would lose his left arm.    Singer Joe Elliot's voice was its strongest as well displaying a great range throughoug the wide range of songs on this album.  Guitarist Steve Clark along with Pete Willis (who would be sacked shortly before this album was completed) create a great guitar team.  Peter Collen only contributed some solos to this album as he joined really late in the game, but his solo on the track Stagefright (my favorite DL tune of all time BTW) is amazing in both his note choice & chops in addition to his feel.   Bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen create a rock solid rhythm section in the vein of AC/DC and add to the proceedings without drawing too much attention to themselves.    Producer Robert \"Mutt\" Lange would contribue to a co-writer on most tracks in addition to adding a very clean and crips sheen to all of the tracks.  This is one of the most well mixed rock/metal albums ever.    To be honest, there's not much more I can say about how great this album is that other countless reviewers have already stated.    This is Def Leppard at the height of their powers/creativity and unfortunately beginning slightly with Hysteria, the world would see the band crumble into self parody and an endless sea of wretched power ballads.

            "input": "An artist in flux . Precious is an interesting document of a band in flux, searching for a sound. Gnecco's voice is in fine form, but on only his second record, he is repeating himself. The wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again, which begs the question, is there true vocal range here, or a couple of parlor trick notes? We will not be sure until we hear more form OURS. When not in falsetto, Gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery. In addition, the chemistry between the band seems off, making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed, The guitar lines which Milone and Gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes, seem dissonant and unneccessary. This music would be better served by simpler production. Ethan Johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that isn't sure weather it's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff. &quot;Leaves&quot; is the lone high spot for this album, with its catchy Beatles meets U2 progression. The rest of the album, as typified by &quot;Kill the Band&quot; lacks cohesion, hooks, and musical identity. Instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves, it seems like Gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple. Lyrically, Gneeco could use some help, as he is repeating rhymes, and syllabic patterns all over the place. From a standpoint of lyical meaning, the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe. Nothing new here. Maybe just a sophomore jinx. stay tuned",

But unforutunately the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because this soundtrack doesn't have exactly what I saw on stage, and I loved that better. This is an awesome soundtrack though.    When I went to see this musical, only 3 members of the original cast were still on the play: Norbert Leo Butz as \"Freddy,\" Joanna Gleason as \"Muriel,\" and Gregory Jbara as \"Andre.\" But, that night I went to see it, Gergory Jbara was substituted by Dennis Parlato, so I really only saw 2 original cast members.    Normally when you see a musical on stage or on film for the first time, you don't really get the \"entire\" taste of the music part because you have to concentrate on the story, the characters, and what's going on and what you're looking at. Sometimes its even hard to remember the music you heard until you listen to it again without visual aid, unless the performance of the songs were very memorable. And the song that really stuck out here was Norbert's performance of \"Great Big Stuff.\" His physical comedy and every single word rang with crass wit that was over the top and just begs you for more. Norbert Leo Butz plays \"Freddy Benson\" by the way.    When I saw the play, Johnathan Pryce was playing the part of \"Laurence Jameson.\" And Pryce is an actual British person, which kind of made his role more believable. His voice really fit the part. John Lithgow at times appears to lose his accent in the soundtrack. John Lithgow isn't bad for the part though, and when he has to impersonate an Austrian Doctor, he does an over the top job.     Dennis Parlato (Jbara's substitute) I believe did a better job at playing a Frenchman. His accent seemed less forced than Gregory's here. Gregory brings a much more \"snooty\" personality to Andre than Dennis did. Maybe that's what was originally intended perhaps.    Mylinda Hall played Jolene Oaks when I saw it, and in my opinion she did a far more fantastic job than Sara Gettelfinger. Sara sounds a bit too \"mature\" and a little older too. Jolene is supposed to be young, dumb, and full of fun!    Now Sherie Rene Scott does a fantastic job at playing \"Christine Colgate\" and better than Rachel York, the girl I saw. Rachel York was good, but Sherie does a good job at being a ditz, like Christine is supposed to be. She hits those high notes with ease and gives a nice flair of innocence in her role.    \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" is a great musical adaptation to a movie, and I believe that you can buy the soundtrack before seeing the play but vice versa. However, if you are listening to the soundtrack before seeing the play, you better take \"A Message from John Lithgow\" very seriously because you won't enjoy the play as much if you see it after listening to the soundtrack. So do what John Lithgow says!",

Same goes for \"Annie Christian\", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders.

            "input": "Oh, Lord... . I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was \"Grind With Me\" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.    I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond \"Baby Blue\", and Slick -- and I use the term \"rapper\" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single \"Grind With Me\" is really called \"Grind On Me\", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but \"Playhouse\" isn't far behind. And \"Nothing But a Number\" is very, very statutory.    Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like \"If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right\" on \"Grind On Me\", or \"If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'\" on \"Grill `Em\" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like \"FROM THE BACK!\" on \"Get a Little Closer\", and \"Yes, sir!\" on \"Your Body\". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on \"Shorty Be Mine\" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.    Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on \"Never Let You Go\", \"Can't Live Without You\", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs \"Chevy\" and \"Grill `Em\". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of \"Your Body\", dammit, I'll beat it up.    Anthony Ruper",

I was browsing a mom and pop record store looking for hard to find cds and in their new release section I came across \"Pestapokalyspse VI\".  Being a fan of death metal I decided to give it a try.  I'm always looking for new bands to get into.  I am very glad I gave these guys a whirl.   The best way I can describe the sound of this album is that is seems to be a strong combination of Norwegian black metal and death metal.      The heaviest aspect to this record in my opinion is the drums, there are ton of pummeling blast beats that are just relentless from these German dark lords.  As heavy as Belphegor are they also have a strong sense of melody.  After the first two tracks of pummeling death metal the band then slows down a bit with the track \"Angel of Retribution\".  There is some pretty impressive guitar work on this song.  There is also some really dark demonic like chanting on this record which to me Belphegor could write the soundtrack for an Omen film.   In my ignorance I thought this was new band but I believe they have 2 to 3 releases before this one.  After hearing \"PestapokalyseVI\" I would definitely pick up some of there other records.  My suggestion to anyone who is into death and black metal to pick this one up, Belphegor are a great combination of the two styles of extreme metal.  Some of the highlight tracks in my opinion are \"Hell's Amassador\", \"Pest teufel apocalypse\" and \"Seyn todt in Schwartz\".  This is must for any extreme metal head.  A brutal hidden treasure of 2006.",

            "input": "The start of a string of brilliant works . This is, perhaps, The Rolling Stones' masterpiece. After the disaster that was \"His Satanic Majesty's Request\" the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends (and, one might add, following in The Beatles' footsteps).     Brian Jones appears only sporadically, it's his last album with the band. The Stones brought in Jimmy Miller to produce, after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides Mick and Keith at the mixing board. Nicky Hopkins' contribution to this album can't be understated. Rumor has it that Ry Cooder participated in the sessions.    \"Sympathy For The Devil\" kicks things off. For an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see Jean Luc Godard's \"One Plus One\" (aka \"Sympathy For The Devil\"). This song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar. In my opinion this is one of Mick's best lyrics.    \"No Expectations\" is a beautiful song, with lovely piano work by Hopkins. The lyric is a bit trite, but it works. Believe it or not this was the first single - it's perhaps the weakest song on the album.    \"Dear Doctor\" is really, really funny. The Stones were fans of country music, but here they take on the form as a cliche. \"For the gal I'm to marry / Is a bow-legged sow / I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge.\" This is a hoot.    \"Stray Cat Blues\" - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band. Jeez, I hope not! This is very creepy stuff. Mick's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy (\"Yeah, just don't care...\"). He sings this like an utter pervert, which is the point. \"Well I can see that you're 15 years old / But I don't want your ID.\" By now it's obvious to the listener that The Stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from? It's unlike anything we've heard on previous Stones albums.     \"Jigsaw Puzzle\" - many fans don't care for this song. It's a bit of a throwback, somewhat reminiscent of \"Something Happened To Me Yesterday\" and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band. Mick's lyric is a bit overwritten, but the final verse in particular is quite good. The band jams out well here - Keith, Wyman and Hopkins play off one another brilliantly, particularly in the coda. It's a fine side-ender.    \"Street Fighting Man\" - some of this was recorded in a living room. The basic drums are Charlie banging on telephone directory books. Some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck. The sitar is Brian; more amazing Hopkins piano here. This was, I believe, the start of Keith using the famous \"open G\" tuning he has employed since. A solid song, but I've always thought it a bit over-rated.    \"Prodigal Son\" - country blues, based on the Bible story. Mick's lyric is perfect, as is his vocal delivery. No contemporary British band could sound as authentically American when doing this style of blues.    \"Parachute Woman\" - more blues, but now we move from the Delta to the Big City. Bill Wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite Stones track. The sound is (purposefully?) muddy, and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance. This is powerful stuff.      \"Factory Girl\" - an underrated gem. It's a beautiful song with a lilting melody, a fun yet poignant lyric, and a wonderful performance by all. \"Waitin' for a girl who's got stains all down her dress / waitin' for a girl and my feet are gettin' wet / she ain't come out yet / waitin' for a factory girl\" - that's as fine a depiction of working class life as I've yet come across.     \"Salt Of The Earth\" - the first verse is Keith Richard's first lead vocal on record. This is a stirring song, an apt followup to \"Factory Girl.\" I wasn't at all surprised that this was a song Mick and Keith chose to perform at \"The Concert For NYC.\" The vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship.    If one is familiar with The Rolling Stones only as a \"hit\" group, this album could be disappointing - there's no obvious Top Ten hit here. But if you appreciate music, and if you know anything about the history of this group, you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album.     There isn't a bad track here. Each is brilliant in its own way. And, of course, this was the first of five great albums produced by The Stones - \"Beggar's Banquet,\" \"Let It Bleed,\" \"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out,\" \"Sticky Fingers,\" and \"Exile On Main Street.\" They had never before reached these heights - and never would again.    The Rolling Stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of The Beatles and Bob Dylan (\"The Holy Trinity\" of the 60's) on the strength of the five albums noted above. They had a lot of hits before \"Beggar's Banquet,\" but if that was all they'd done they would be regarded as equals to The Animals or The Yardbirds, etal. They became rock royalty when they produced \"Beggar's Banquet.",

I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.    But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each \"song\" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.    This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.   I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.    You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.      Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*..",

The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.    Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.

They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, \"Oh, THIS won't be jazz.\" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found \"Prime\" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the \"smooth jazz\" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts",

Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.      Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros. Waterfall was OK, but it has nothing on &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Bring You Back&quot;, or &quot;I've Got a Big Bowl of Cherries&quot;.      And for the people complaining about Jonathan's death hanging too much over this album, this album was ALL ABOUT Jonathan's death! The whole reason they wrote the thing was part of their grieving process. The album is DEDICATED to him! Get a clue!      To the reviewer ragging on the hidden track: That's deidcated to Trevor Horn, who screwed the girls over when he was producing (or more accurately, supposed to be producing) their album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing.       So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones. Tchad Blake did a great job on production, and the track lineup is varied and engaging. Every song has great depth and excellent melody",

My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner.

            "input": "Z - My Morning Jacket . The quintet, which forms My Morning Jacket, hail from Louisville Ky. The lead singer and band's leader/founder has the unlikely name Jim James. I have to assume that since Jim is the shortened version for James, making his formal name James James, that his mother was drunk when she named him. J.J. founded the band in the late nineties with his cousin, guitarist John John. Gotcha! Just kidding. Cuzz's name was John Quaid. Cuzz along with keyboardist Danny Cash, found the touring too much of a grind and left the band after the release of their third album. In addition to J.J. their current lineup consists of: Two-tone Tommy on Bass, Patrick Hallahan on Drums. Late joiners Bo Koster (keyboards) and Carl Broemel (guitar) replaced Quaid and Cash.    Z    My first impression of `Z' was that it was quite a bit different than my typical choice for aural enjoyment. My second impression was that it was not something for which I would lay down fifteen bucks. My last and continuing impression was that there was, indeed some worthwhile enjoyable music emanating from my CD player.    Trying to categorize the band's music is challenging. I word have to say the overall the band play's an indie sounding pop-rock with forays into progressive, folk and alternative, even psychedelia. Their music tends to be happy and poppy with a lot of variation between songs. The album starts off with a song named \"Wordless,\" which actually reminds me of the song \"Angel\" from the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack but with a mild cha cha style beat. It's probably because of J.J.'s strong singing on the song but for me the similarities are strong. \"It Beats 4 U\" White Stripes beginning doesn't impress me, but picks up in the middle with J.J.'s reverberated vocals, a cello, some whistling, finishing somewhat psychedelic. Track three, \"Gideon,\" has some interesting moments with J.J. sounding like he's singing through a tunnel yet his vocal remain strong. The song has some noticeably good keyboards and the tempo builds ending in a crescendo.    \"What a Wonderful Man,\" is a short mulligan stew style song featuring tavern kind of vocals and a tinny guitar.\" Track five is \"Off the Record.\" I didn't particularly like the beginning but about a third of the way through it becomes a fabulous bluesy, psychedelic instrumental. \"In the Woods\" starts out with a circus Hammond which recurs throughout augmenting an um pah pah circus beat. The seventh song is \"Anytime,\" probably the rockingest if not the catchiest song on the album.    The next song at just over six minutes is the penultimate longest song. Other than some really good piano parts, that seems to be the most memorable part of \"Lay Low.\" The ninth track, \"Knot come loose,\" is a forgettable ballad but the last song \"Dondante is an eight minute masterpiece, by far the best and most refreshing song on the album.\" Beginning inauspiciously with J.J. singing to a slow casual beat and subtle guitar, the song heats up after a slow start, immediately after a nice guitar solo into an explosion of sound, featuring J.J.'s soaring vocals and a whining guitar, ala post rock style, before gradually fading out to obscurity.    Conclusion    I don't think I'd plunk down fifteen bucks for \"Z\" because even though it's a pretty good album, I would seldom if ever be in the mood for this confluence of eclectically influenced music, especially since I tend to gravitate to the heavier variety of music. However, I cannot help but feel that it would appeal to a large segment of the music buying public. Are you one of them?    Final rating 4 stars.",

            "input": "It takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but it's worth it! . Being a fan of The Divine Comedy since they released Casanova in 1996, I was really looking forward to their latest album. Much like a lot of previous releases by The DC, this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it. When I first listened to it, I was disappointed with most of the early tracks and didn't listen beyond track 7. However, repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection. Track-by-track:    1. To Die A Virgin - Amusing lyrics, but the melody doesn't do anything for me. Opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here, this being no exception. It sounds a bit flat to me.    2. Mother Dear - An unusual country track with a catchy melody, but a far too repetitive chorus. Musically it's great, but the constant repetition of \"Mother Dear\" quickly becomes tiresome.    3. Diva Lady - Not bad, but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by Neil Hannon. Annoyingly it sticks in your head - I'd rather it didn't!    4. A Lady Of A Certain Age - Beautiful melodies, wonderful instrumentation, and moving lyrics. I've always liked Hannon's voice, but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to. Stunning.    5. The Light Of Day - A bright, upbeat melody, again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the DC have always done so well.    6. Threesome - A charming 1 minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album.    7. Party Fears Two - Elsewhere I've hear people calling The Plough pompous; if any track sounds pompous, it is this one. I haven't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that isn't all that special. The chorus is better than the verse, but this just sounds out of place here.    8. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World - This one's quite odd. I didn't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you. Great lyrics, a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies. Very well composed indeed.    9. The Plough - As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous. It's an absolute masterpiece. A wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track. A similar feel to The Certainty of Chance or Freedom Road, this is one of the best tracks I have ever heard from the DC.    10. Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont - The opening melody links well from The Plough. Great melodies throughout, an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics, not dissimilar to The Booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over. Very special, and unique!    11. Snowball In Negative - Yet again, the orchestral arrangements are superb. Interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos, showing that Threesome wasn't such an anomaly after all. The ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out, but this track wraps up the album well.    Apart from the first few tracks, this is possibly the best DC album I've ever heard. It's right up there with Promenade and Fin De Siecle and is a welcome reminder that Hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon. Beautiful",

Check out Augustana, without doubt last year's most promising new band, completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that'd be Epic, which has been in a tailspin since Polly Anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist.  Their debut album, the extraordinary All the Stars and Boulevards, was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and, minus even a modicum of press or publicity, got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases; its soaring title track -- one of `05's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy.  So how's this for a dark horse story?  Practically as an afterthought as spring closed, Epic chose as Boulevards' second single the wistful, resplendent \"Boston\" and then sat on their dead, numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band's twenty-one-year-old (!) lead singer Dan Layus (think 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold with a more agile voice, and much much cuter) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily, week on week, against all conventional wisdom which states that summer, with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments, is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex, chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation, and whose back half, in lieu of a repetitive refrain, rockets to a soul-cleansing, cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings.  Now there's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that Epic re-released Boulevards last week with extra tracks, an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me, if for no other reason than I'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin' record, and that's what they count on, but if it helps Augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be, all will be forgiven.",

Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.     Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like \"Terribile lo Sento\", and \"Orribile lo Scempio\", \"GI'otraggi\" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic.",

LOS LONELY BOYS, the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from Texas, is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that's one part rock & roll, one part country, one part Chicano, one part lullaby and 200 parts stone-cold gorgeous.    Because I'm a big hip hop fan who loves Pavoratti, I don't often find myself in this aisle of the music store. (And by the way what aisle is this?) But a friend gave me this CD and after letting it sit, collecting dust for over a year, I popped it into the stereo on a whim.  What a wonderful surprise.    Almost like love at first hear, I found myself bopping along to literally every tune, as though I had grown on this music.      These guys are amazing singers, musicians and song writers.  Bilingual, they often switch back and forth from English lyrics to Spanish ad libs. Plus it contains two versions of More Than Love, one in English and the other in Spanish -- which reminds the listener of their Texican roots.      Double sided, this CD features 12 songs on one side and 8 videos on the other.  Some are acoustic and reveal just how talented (not to mention charming) this band is.    Because I know so little about country, rock & rock and Mexican-twinged music, it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band's sound to anyone else's, but if forced to I'd say Sting.   Not because it sounds like Sting's music, but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you've heard these songs all of your life.  Plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious.    -- Regina McMenami",

Long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la, there are some that would argue that Y2K was really the day the music died. (If not even sooner, but those folks didn't like Nirvana, Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. Go figure.)    Well, anyone who's heard \"Gentlemen\" or \"Congregation\" or any other record by the Afghan Whigs should be yelling \"Rescue me, Dulli!\" And on \"Powder Burns,\" Greg's delivered the goods.    Possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the Whigs' \"Black Love,\" the new Twilight Singers record still shouldn't be construed as an Afghan Whigs album without the name. Despite Dulli wearing lead singer shoes, which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated, tunelessly-endearing sound, the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the Whigs. Sure, it's dirty, dirty, grungy blues-rock, but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there. \"Bonnie Brae\" is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze. Piano and violin pepper tracks like \"There's Been An Accident,\" while rushing, watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there, most obviously on the intro piece \"Toward the Waves\"/\"I'm Ready.\"    Of course to think ahead, people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place. Dulli liked smashing Beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he's taken to purloining lyrics, too, reframing the timeless refrain of \"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah\" with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din (\"Forty Dollars\").    Not every word on \"Powder Burns\" is an homage, however. Lyrically, Dulli has always struck me as a singing Charles Bukowski.

A brilliant work, and no this review isn't of much help really, but I'd like to forward a theory about the guitar solo in the prog rocker Roots of Coincidence: PM had been listening to Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson in the mid 90's as Scott moved away from compositional jazz-fusion toward fearless, bluesy, attitude-driven free-form guitar, decided Scott was having way too much fun at it - and with songs like \"Canine\" on TT's Face First who could argue? - thusly deciding to stake his claim on this invigorating new ground. It's good, interesting, but fleeting and disjointed, and Scott does it better. Still, what PMG here, on Imaginary Day as elsewhere, are able to render as musical generalists, by selecting from the full pallette of sonic colors and using each to maximum effect, ah!

I am also a musician, singer, and writer of a \"country roots\" perspective (who now lives 40 min. outside NYC), who understands how crappy the business can be.     My biggest complaint about Rockie, my fellow Minnesotan, is simply this:  He and his music don't sound like they come from Minnesota, nor Carolina (his birthplace, am I correct?), and lotsa' good country music comes from these two regions.  I mean, this record is produced well and sounds generally good, but he sounds like someone who is taking the advice of all the jackasses from Nashville who say, \"Ya' gotta' sound like this and look like this; 'cause that's what works down here, plain and simple!\"      Well, I think that theory is gonna' die sooner than later.  You gots guys like Djerks Bently and Eric Church who are still not exactly where country needs to be, but they are making a slight dent in the \"soccer-momming\" of country music.      Wanna' hear good country music?  Check out 10 City Run!  They are what CMT should be airing, and they are getting airplay on \"Wide Open Country\" (seriously, check out this band, and my review of them--10 City Run--for they're the real frickin' deal).     So Rockie, my friendly advice would be this: drop the affected, mainstream, country radio accent (don't replace it with a hard-core Minnesota accent, however--Fargoooo--no good), get a band that plays more than one kind of country music, and draw on the great history of music that has come from Minnesota (Jayhawks, Replacements, even Marvin Rainwater, oh, and that Bob Dylan-dude) and Carolina (too many influences to even start!) 'cause that's you, man! That's where you're from! That's how you'll sound genuine (as the one reviewer noticed how at times you seemed to be trying too hard, other times, not hard enough)!

Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  \"Body\" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.

While the idea to make a collection of the fall out of punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s after the great No Thanks box is a really interesting idea yet it proves extremely hard to pull off. Why? Well when punk became new wave and hardcore became alternative, you were left with so many sounds, so many viewpoints. While it totally made the music scene much more interesting compiling it to 4 discs makes it a hard listen sometimes because of that collage of styles. So its a great learning experience for the uninitiated to learn from, and its a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up with this music. For those of us in the middle we are left kinda scratching our chins and flipping over some of the tracks. I must say however that Rhino did choose the prime cuts from each group, and chose the right groups from each scene but thats what Rhino is great at archival material.

THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous \"Pizza boy\" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as \"background music.\"  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.    By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)

            "input": "No more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood, Please! . I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.    I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what \"Dirty Harry\" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?      I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.      I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his \"music\" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.       While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.      I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.    I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.    Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?      Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.    Bryan Arata",

The Orb's \"Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld\" was essentially one of if not THE first ambient house album (it at least inspired other artists and (somewhat) popularized the genre - \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" is a very appealing track). It is, admittedly, a little uneven. If you've only heard the song \"Little Fluffy Clouds\", be prepared for a quick change of pace. The rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental, but for ambient fans and the open-minded it's very interesting stuff to listen to. My personal favorites are the first three tracks, and the rest I don't think are as fun to listen to as a whole (they're definitely very good, though). It's not ambient in a traditional sense - there's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible. What's also great is how you're essentially getting two albums for the price of one (actually more like the price of 1.5 albums)! If it weren't for this fact and its influence on the world of music, I probably would've given it a 4.5. Ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it, though. Even if most people won't like the album as a whole, they'll most likely enjoy \"Little Fluffy Clouds\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album",

            "input": "Magical, if not uneven, Journey . 'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.    To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful \"Fool on the Hill,\" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's \"I am the Walrus\" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  \"Flying\" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, \"Your Mother Should Know,\" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including \"When I'm Sixty Four\" and \"Honey Pie\".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, \"Blue Jay Way\".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.    The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  \"Hello/Goodbye\" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  \"All You Need Is Love\" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  \"Baby You're a Rich Man,\" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.    Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.",

            "input": "Sloppy Mush . This review concentrates on the four live tracks.    By December 1970, Miles Davis' fusion was evolving even beyond the Bitches Brew era. The emphasis was more and more in the rhythm, and less and less on coherent solos. Miles Davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn, getting a sound that was thin, whiny and rather annoying. Keith Jarrett and Michael Henderson joined the band, lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively.     Live Evil basically consists of several edited jams from the Cellar Door recordings of December 1970.     SIVAD:  The recording begins on a high point; vicious funk punctuated by Airto Moreira's squawking Cuica, and stabbed through with Miles Davis' electric trumpet. This is actually a version of \"Directions\" by Joe Zawinul, although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable. The statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade. Miles' horn is electric, and its sound is a mixture of Birth of the Cool and Axis: Bold as Love. Truly strange, and frankly not a very nice sound.    Three and a half minutes in, the groove shifts to \"Honky Tonk\", a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme. The performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune (!) and one studio version! Miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section; and Airto Moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny. Sloppy and shapeless.      WHAT I SAY:  A feature for Jack de Johnette, a terrific drummer. The groove is extremely harsh and energetic, with Miles soloing with an open horn. Unlike the other tracks, this is actually a complete performance (segueing into \"Sanctuary\" at the end) and is quite impressive. I really like Jarret's electric piano/organ solo and Johnette's drum solo!      FUNKY TONK/INAMORATA:  In which Teo Macero goes nuts with the scissors. This is actually one big slab of a performance, cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an LP. And it is not one piece of music, but three:  1. \"Directions\": Yet another performance of Zawinul's piece. Much more conventional than the \"Sivad\" version, though again with all the statements of the theme cut out. Miles soloes with electric trumpet.    2. Then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the Mission Impossible theme! So this is where they got that theme. The name of the tune is sometimes called \"Funky Tonk\", and sometimes \"Inamorata\". A very long, sloppy, shapeless morass of solos. Again, Jarret's solo is most beautiful.    3.Finally the groove shifts to \"It's About That Time\" from \"In a Silent Way\". A performance that does not shift into the second bassline. Halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird, associative poem about the mysteries of Music.   At the fade-out, you can hear the groove shifting to \"Sanctuary...\"    Overall, the album is extremely messy, with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing. Atmospheric and very dense.",

Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused (\"Without a Song\"), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of \"God Bless the Child\") and emotive (\"Where Are You?\").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on \"God Bless the Child\", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.    All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or \"Saxophone Collosus\") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.

Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses annd Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.     The album takes some time to get used to, but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a 16-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me.     The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldy innovative work. Ever.",

Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the \"Gee, that's neat\" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off \"The Audience is Listening\": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem.",

Judging by their latest release \"A Murder of Crows\", Incubus have ditched their funk/Nu-Metal/Progressive/Poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound. And for good reason. The moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out, and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to Nu-Metal usually replicate the Nu-metal bands that came before them. Lets face it, Nu-Metal is dead, and it never really was that great to begin with. Incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated Hip Hop/Funk/Metal/Jazz and a DJ all in one package.  \"Morning View\" sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career. Now in the lime light, with millions of fans, \"Morningview\" does show the band ditching much of their Hip-Hop/Funky roots for more mature production and compostition. The vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat. That is not to say that \"Morninview\" is a less-than-stellar album, on the contrary, it is an album worth owning with much to offer. The musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful.  \"Morninview\" takes time to break into, and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a \"great\" radio friendly album. Just like \"Make Yourself\" I took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song. Under a new light one can easily see that \"Morninview\" is one of the greatest releases of its time",

John Barry's scores to &quot;Dances with Wolves,&quot; &quot;Out of Africa,&quot; and  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (except for the Rachmaninoff), are like that.   James Horner's scores are a little better differentiated.  But the two  best, able to write evocative scores that capture the essence of the film's  story and make us FEEL it--without leaving us thinking we've heard this  before--are Jerry Goldsmith (e.g., &quot;The Sandpebbles&quot;) and John  Williams.  Here, like Goldsmith's score to &quot;The Wind and the  Lion,&quot; Williams is able to take a truly exotic motif--the musical  forms of West Africa--and mix it with truly American, if a little  Copland-esqe-sounding, music.  And that's the whole idea.  People were  violently ripped from their homes and transported to, for them, a place no  less alien and bizarre than Africa was to white Europeans and Americans.   And yet the United States was a place that declared &quot;All men are  created equal.&quot;  The contemplative, high-principle-sounding music to  &quot;Mr. Adams Takes the Case,&quot; is as stirring as the exotic  &quot;Dry Your Tears, Afrika,&quot; but in a completely different way. That  John Williams is able to do that in score after score is what makes him one  of the all-time greatest in a genre that hasn't been around all that long.   My only wish is that film score composers would more often produce true,  symphonic suites from their film scores that can be played by orchestras as  stand-alone, concert pieces.  I hope this music becomes such a suite.  Like  the subject matter of the movie--the eternal human quest for freedom and  equality--it would become timeless",

At   first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got   annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began  to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the  road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage,  everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they  were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them  all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause.  No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats.

I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?      R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.

Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (\"In Search of Peter Pan\", \"In the Warm Room\"), a more pop structure (\"Wow\"), rhythmic shifts (\"Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake\") an almost shuffle (\"Fullhouse\") and a gret rock song (\"Hammer Horror\").

The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing \"Kashka from Baghdad\" can be all that bad, and certainly \"Symphony in Blue\" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.

To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom,   But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring.  It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.      The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all.  But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all.  But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well.    This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect.  This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls.    The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship.  Those are rare commodities in today's music industry.  Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom.",

He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly \"note-for-note\" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close \"pop\" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey \"Masterpiece Theatre\"-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week",

The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease.

I have some sympathy for Ben Fassett's earlier comment.  Those who have heard Antje Duvekot's earlier works (\"Little Peppermints\" and \"Boys, Flowers, Miles\") may be surprised by her sound in this CD.     I was fortunate enough to hear her live in concert the other night, and was completely impressed by her presence and performance.  Her earlier CDs convey the power of her solo performance; think Patty Griffin's \"Living with Ghosts\" as a comparable example.  Paradoxically, less is more.      This CD, on the other hand, adds string arrangements and other instruments to her voice and guitar.  I think that some of the raw emotion and poignancy can get lost in the production, and her voice can occasionally be muted.  In her concert, she performed some of the new songs from this CD, and they were very much in the style of her earlier CDs.    The earlier CDs also reveal her live demeanor which is quite shy, humorous and self-deprecating.  You should really try to see her in person if you have a chance.    On the other hand, this CD represents more Antje Duvekot, and that is never a bad thing.  It is still well worth the purchase, but consider also \"Boys, Flowers, Miles\" to hear the power of her solo voice",

It was recommended to me by a South African, whose ethnic background is Caucasian, that to learn about South Africa's recent history and culture, one should read this book.    This book is truly amazing and very, very informative.  The civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted.  The decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable.    One important point is that many individuals did not share their government's oppressive policies and many, regardless of ethnic background, supported Mr. Mandela.  His ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring.    If one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen, with very restrictive policies in a police state, this book is it.  We in the US are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted.  After reading this book, I am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person's ability to perform, not their ethnic or religious background.

He would apparently refer the knuckle-dragging, amateurish, talentless stylings of the hundreds of bands that play the same three notes a thousand beats per minute while some oaf screams and growls unintelligible garble supposedly using all sorts of elaborate words for 'kill' that neither the band nor the fans know how to use or say properly.  OK, now that I've gotten that rant over with, let me continue on to what you really want to read. This was actually the very first Manowar album I heard. A friend picked it up the day it came out, let me borrow it after he listened to it once, and never got it back (sorry Darren). I was forever hooked. The first half of the album is classic, well produced, straight ahead metal. Fantastic, clear solos on each song. The title track is a classic Manowar anthem. It sums up what they are quite well. 'Blow Your Speakers' is not only another trademark metal anthem, but is also the closest Manowar has gotten to an actual \"hit\" in the U.S. \"Carry On\", one of my instant favorites, is and inspirational rally cry; the kind Manowar is known for, among other things. \"Violence and Bloodshed' is a fast and furious return to the Heavy Metal beginnings and Vietnam theme that hasn't been seen since the first album \"Battle Hymns\". All in all the first half of this album is just in your face heavy metal.   The second half is a return to the days of long, long ago. 'Defender' is one of the last things that the late, great Orson Welles ever did before his passing. I listened to this track at least 200 times in the first week I had this album. It aptly sets the tone for the rest of the record. A rich narrative that opens to a powerful crash of truly heavy metal. From this point on, this album does it all. Beautifully clear and powerful bass lines. Articulate and soaring lead solos. Earth shaking Drums. And the absolute best vocals on any recording of the time. 'Drums of Doom' pounds you into 'Holy War' like a charging team of mammoth beasts which then throws you into the 'Master of Revenge', a mystical segue into 'Black Wind, Fire and Steel' which blinds all with the relentless speed and accuracy of both music and lyrics. All done at a rate that almost defies logic. Manowar have definitely cemented there place as the Kings of Metal with this album forevermore. All those who refuse to believe it can go back their amateurs and goons. Leave us and make room for the true men of heavy metal.",

I must say, witohut a frickin doubt, this is the cheesiest album that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I shelled out 15 bucks for this album and I wish that I saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums, and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it. The band overall has good musicianship, (and their singer is hot), yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes. THe band has potential, and it might help if the f***in music video wasn't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen.

He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass.    Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few.    I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now.     The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too.",

            "input": "Still a Lot of \"Country\" on this Crossover Album . In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill.   Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album \"Faith\" that helped her break into mainstream music.  Surprisingly, while \"Faith\" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album.     By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert.  The nice thing about \"Faith\" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table.   While \"Faith\" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre.   Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album.  Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist.  Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort.  On \"Faith\", this doesn't appear to be a problem.  She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with.  Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product.   The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs.   Therefore she just isn't a \"vocalist for hire\".  She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound.  This is why \"Faith\" is a solid collection.    \"This Kiss\" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene.   This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill.  In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away.   One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a \"pop\" song.  However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan).    This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor.  The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as \"It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment\".  The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor.  This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song).    At first, upon purchasing \"Faith\", I expected it would basically be \"This Kiss\" and not much else.  However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case.   There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection.   The second song \"You Give Me Love\" is also pretty catchy.  This has much more of a country element on this song.  This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan.     Although not as catchy a song, \"Let Me Let Go\" is worth mentioning.  The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill.  Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element.  This song clearly has a Country Element and it works.  This song also features a string section of viola players.  The Country Music element is alive and well in the song \"Better Days\".   This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette.  This song also features Duncan's Fiddle.      The Country Music element is also present in the song \"My Wild Frontier\".   This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie.  Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep.  This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith.    The best song on the album is \"The Secret of Life\".   This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on \"On a Day Like Today\" and his \"Unplugged\" album.   The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what \"the secret of life is\".   No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan.  Simple lyrics like \"The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini\" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or \"The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee\" give this song a very special quality.    Two other country element songs are that are solid are \"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\" and \"The Hard Way\".  In \"Just to Hear You Say You Love Me\", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw.   As for \"The Hard Way\", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics \"I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way\".  Finally, \"Me\" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is.    On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of \"Somebody Stand By Me\".  Not a great song, but worth mentioning.    All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes.  This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans.  Highly Recommended",

Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.    Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.    And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.    Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.    My recommendations are:  The Update,  Futterman's Rule,  Flute Loop,  Sure Shot,  Heart Attack Man,  B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.    Enjoy",

I was very disappointed with the latest album from Bon Jovi, a band that has put out numerous exceptionally high quality albums throughout their career.  Obviously no one still expects them to put out albums today that set the scene of what is cool music wise, that they did back in the 80's and early 90's with the classics such as Slippery When Wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith.  Obviously like everyone else from that era they rely on the next generation to tell them what is the latest rage music wise but this album music wise doesn't seem to fall into the latest style or ignore the latest trends and maintain their classic sound.     The album is like a continuation sound wise of their previous album This Left Feels Right, which was a greatest hits album rerecorded with their classic songs in a way that emphasised their lyrics.  That was great for the classics songs hearing them in a new way but this style for a whole album of new songs really doesn't do anything for me or anyone else I've come across.  Have a Nice Day is catchy and fast enough to be a great live song and it'll be around for a while if not forever but I don't think in five years time any other song from this album, like with other mediocre albums like Crush and Bounce will be played on the radio or at a Bon Jovi concert (and make sure you go to one of these before you or they die as they are the best live band one earth).  I hope that the guys have a few more good albums left in them but this certainly is not an indication that they do.",

Hell, I might even go to church if they sang honest songs about mortality like the chillingly beautiful \"Dirt in the Ground\"!  \"The Ocean Doesn't Want Me\" is his best spoken word piece ever.  \"Jesus Gonna Be Here\" just flat rocks out.

After numerous disses throughout the years when 50 and his clique were in the underground scene til 2003, Ja Rule's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes.

            "input": "RAP CLASSIC . This is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores. The two headed monsta Black C and Mr Cee, along with company, Cellski and Hitman put together pounding beats, sick flows, and sweet hooks. The rhymes are very creative. The highlights of this album be \"Blue Bird\" best track on the LP, \"Bounce to this\" gets your pumped for the album. \"I Got my nine\". \"Niggaz on the jock\" \"M.N.O.H.P\" \"Pass the zig zags\" and \"Dedication\" but all the tracks pound. This gem from RBL Posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan",
