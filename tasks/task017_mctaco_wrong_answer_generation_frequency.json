        "In this task, we ask you to write an implausible answer to a question that involves event \"frequency\", which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. Please try to keep your \"answer\" as simple as possible. Concise and simple \"answer\" is preferred over those complex and verbose ones."
