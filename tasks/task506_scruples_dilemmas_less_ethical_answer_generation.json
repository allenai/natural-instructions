	"Definition": "Given an action statement, generate another action statement which is less ethical, that is, morally less right.",
	"Positive Examples": [
		{
			"input": "starting a fight over pizza",
			"output": "calling my mother a bitch during her birthday party",
			"explanation": "Saying inappropriate things to one's mother on her special occasion is very rude. On the other hand, starting a fight over pizza most of the time is harmless. So the generated statement is less ethical than the given action."
		},
		{
			"input": "not knowing anything about computers",
			"output": "taking my son's PS4 he bought himself",
			"explanation": "taking son's object which he bought himself with his own money is insensitive and might hurt his feelings. On the other hand, not knowing something does not harm others. So the generated statement is less ethical than the given action."
		}
	],
	"Negative Examples": [
		{
			"input": "telling my friends sister that she probably won't get a celebrity to go to prom with her",
			"output": "breaking off a \"friendship\" and leaving it as business only",
			"explanation": "Both the actions are morally wrong and one cannot be differentiated from the other as morally less wrong"
		},
		{
			"input": "telling my manager to call corporate on my coworker because she smells terrible",
			"output": "hiding that I speak another language from my so",
			"explanation": "Complaining to superior about co-worker is often not the right thing to do whereas speaking another language is a skill and hiding that fact does not hurt someone. Hence the answer is not less ethical than the given action."
