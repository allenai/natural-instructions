One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.",

The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn’t working properly.

I haven't used much because they are pretty thick and don't want to stay in my ears. I read the reviews and was worried this might happen so I bought those ear buddy's to go with. But they only helped some. They still want to fall out. So I have only used a few times while at home. But as of the past week I am having a hard time getting the right one to stay on and work. Every video I played was choppy real annoying to listen to. Not sure if I should buy a replacement one or return looks like I only have till February 11th.

I've tried reaching to the seller but they were giving me such a hard time that I honestly dont want to deal with them anymore and just having to return them back to amazon.

Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right. TL; DR: Seller sent a COMPLETELY different item than ordered, the tried to charge me to package/send said 7-8 foot item back to them in order to get a refund. My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake. I strongly caution you against buying anything from this company.",

What you get is hex head bolts without the hex head cores cut Update: I went to Home Depot and after 15 minutes of searching the hardware aisle, found a specialty bolt with fine thread that would do the trick. Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There’s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back. I’ll only be out the cost of gas, a new bolt and way too much of my time.

Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous.

We were scared. Though generator was off... it was leaking few drops where generator usually is. So, we moved 15 ft away and filled into a tall glass and noticed the leak again. We cleaned up carefully, moved further and now, other friends tried... same result. Open/close lid, check twice, try again, same result. We figured this is unusable... Gas leak is Hazardous... fumes themselves are highly flammable. Guess what, returns not accepted on this product because... Gas cans shipping has certain constraints. It is not as simple as put in same box and ship. Safety, liability constraints makes returns more expensive than product itself. When Amazon was not allowing returns online, I could not figure why there is a no-return policy - I thought $ 35+ gone down the drain. However, when I chatted with Amazon.com support - they were understanding and helpful. They explained why shipping is complicated... advised me not to return product, but issued refund.",

And it never fails that when they do they ruin it. (Maybe the issue is that what's \"broken\" is their profit margins.) I had been using this product for maybe 15 years with great success. When I ran out of my last jug, I came here to Amazon to buy another and saw there were some negative reviews about the smell. Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an \"old formula\" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the \"old\" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was \"Washington Blvd Sales\".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the \"old formula\" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume. Thanks, Spectrum Brands. Your \"new formula\" has wasted my money and possibly ruined my couch. :(",

However, we are now promptly returning it and will buy from a different brand. First, the crevice tool was never included in the box. If the vacuum actually worked as described, this would not have been a huge issue. As you can probably already infer, the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment. After using it twice (both times fully charged), we realized that our old, much cheaper handheld still worked better. With the brush or extension tube attachment connected, it seemed essentially worthless with regard to suction. Further, even without an attachment, the vacuum literally had no true suction power. It struggled to pick up even the smallest and lightest weight particles on the floor, stairs, counter, etc. Again, given the positive reviews, we were very hopeful that it would be a great replacement. Unfortunately, it's boxed up and will be dropped off at UPS tomorrow.",

I contacted the seller and I got an email back saying their customer service is closed until Sunday because of Jewish Shabbat. So what am I supposed to give her as a gift now? The extra items I purchased to go with her crossbow, without the actual crossbow?! 'Happy birthday sister, I got you a crossbow, but it was missing items and I had to send it back, so here is the accessories to it.' Yeah, that's going to go over well.

Now it is zero stars, and I can't say I'd take the chance on it (or Vizio as a brand) ever again. Yes, I unplugged everything, and plugged it into a new outlet (which I know works because that outlet was powering my Apple TV before and after troubleshooting with no issues). Yes, I tried the original remote AND the buttons on the top. There is not even the little white LED light that comes on on the left of the sound bar when it turns on. This unit is dead. Apparently the handful of reviews on this which say it will suddenly fail are correct.

I use a MacBook Pro and it immediately was recognized when I plugged it in. That's where any positives end. The hissing sound from the mic port, even when no mic is plugged in, is unbearable with any gain. Without gain, you can't hear or use the mic. The piano was even worse. No hissing sound, but any chord or combination of keys resulted in a terrible distortion, even with the gain at its lowest. Worst of all, even with the volume all the way up, the instruments were too quiet. I miss my Fast Track Pro desperately. Buying something else and hopefully it will work.

The adhesive on the base appears to be good only for one application. This product is really good (fantastic even, for Android users - more on that later.) It has two mounting options out of the box: Dash mount and vent mount. The dash mount option is surprisingly excellent - it comes with a really sticky adhesive that really does grip most dash materials, making for a great alternative to hogging an A/C vent in warmer climates. The clamping solution is great: Its electronic, and thus, automatically opens when your vehicle provides power or when you touch the bottom of the device. It automatically closes when your phone is placed against the back plate, touching the aforementioned bottom piece from within. My only \"complaint\" is that the device doesn't automatically open when power is cut to the mount. When I pull the key out of the ignition, power is cut to the mount, leaving me to have to \"extract\" my phone by \"pushing/sliding\" it up and out of the clamp surface. When power is restored next, the device opens up again.",

I determined the cause to be a necessary software update, which then wouldn't process due to an incompatibility with a new version of iOS. Two weeks later, I got my mug updated and got to use it. My first experience was putting coffee into the mug, lid closed. I kept the liquid under the \"Fill Line\" as instructed, and when my drink reached temperature and I went to open it to drink, the lid \"popped\" violently, and sprayed liquid everywhere. If you travel with this lid and use it in the closed position, expect to have to force the lid open and have liquid spray out in all directions. It's not a rare occurrence with regular use. The experience, upon using the mug, was nothing exceptional. It would keep drinks warm for about two hours, set to a specific temperature. But, unless it's plugged into its charging pad, I've found it will occasionally \"forget\" to keep the drink warm. I'll tap the logo, the mug will light up and inform me my drink has dropped twenty degrees from where I had it set, and it has to try to warm it up. Not quite the experience I expected, but it's not a major issue. Then, the lid broke. The lid is a ring in the center of the mug, and you have to depress it, where it latches and stays open to allow you to drink. My lid broke such that the lid would no longer latch into place, and would rock off to one side or the other, so that I could either get no liquid out at all, if the lid were centered, or I could get a sporadic and slow trickle of liquid out by getting the lid stuck inside itself. I contacted them and was summarily shipped a replacement lid, and I thought perhaps it would be a fluke. I got the lid, and continued as normal. In this time, the mug would often (probably 8 times out of 10) refuse to turn on without first being touched to the charger. Again, not a great experience for a $150 coffee mug. Then, just now, my second lid broke. I'm going to have to contact customer support again, and see if they'll ship me another lid. All this has occurred since September 2017, a five-month period. Not the level of quality I would presume to get from such an expensive luxury product, but I'll have to consider this a lesson learned. I had high hopes for this product, but it would seem the Kickstarter Curse is as present as ever. It has been a considerable waste of money, energy, and time, and I do not recommend anyone buy this product, or any other product from Ember.",

It also appears that one of the ribbon cables was already damaged and attempted to be fixed by being painted over by a Sharpie. Severely disappointed with the quality control of this screen. Full Review: Once I had received this iPhone 6 Replacement Screen, I promptly went to install it on my old cracked iPhone 6. I placed all the ribbon connectors in the correct place, screwed back on the protector plates and attempted to turn the phone on, and all that greeted me was a black screen instead of the Apple Logo. After looking further into it, it seems as though the backlight turns on, but the display doesn't turn on, and attempting to reinstall this occasionally shows the boot-up sequence normally, but attempting to screw back on the protector plates with screws and turning on the phone ends up with the same issue - Backlight turns on but the Display doesn't. Even then, when the display does turn on when the phone boots up, if I was to put the phone to sleep (locking it) and attempting to wake it up just greets me with the black screen again. I tested the connectors on the board with the old, cracked screen and the display still seems to come on 100% of the time, being usable still despite being cracked, and doesn't go to a black screen when attempting to wake it out of sleep mode or attempting to unlock it (or turning it on). After looking closer on the ribbon cables on the screen itself, it looks as though some of the ribbon cables have been shipped already being damaged. What's even more absurd is that the damage on the ribbon cables seems to have been covered by a permanent marker, leaving a shine as you can see on one of the pictures. Provided are also 2 more pictures, the one with the bluish tint on screen is when the screen is \"on,\" only showing the backlight turns on but the display doesn't. The other picture shows when the screen is off, for comparison. Severely disappointed in this product, will definitely be sending it back and asking for a refund.",

Thank goodness I am pretty good at fixing things and devising solutions to problems. Basically, fixing other people's/companies' poor/cheap designs. After figuring out the right way to assemble this pump, I used it on the first new filter. All I got was a lot of air mixed with some water. I thought at first that this was just the air contained in the new filter element that was being \"expelled\" and replaced by water. After a time, I realized this was not right and looked for the problem. About this time, the plastic tube between the plastic filter adapter and the one-way inlet valve came off of the valve and would not reseal. To fix this, I resorted to a small spring clamp, that you operate with pliers, to fit around and seal the tube to the valve. On the next try, I was still sucking air, so I looked for another problem. This time, after completely submerging the filter in water past the plastic adapter, I discovered that it was the adapter leaking air around the threads. No matter how tight I got the fitting, It still sucked air. I solved this by wrapping some teflon tape around the threads on the filter and the problem was solved. My take away....this is a high priced, poorly designed device and Berkey should redesign and upgrade it. How??? Pre-assemble these using longer tubes and spring clamps on the one-way valves.

The blades that come with this razor did not make for a smooth shaven I had bumps and razor burn immediately after shave. My legs and other private areas were not smooth as they usually are with other razors. Even after purchasing a higher quality blade, I could not achieve a close shave. I also tried various creams and lotions and exfoliating prior to my shave, etc. You will cut yourself the first time so be prepared. Unfortunately just as I learned how to use this razor I am outside of the return window and am now stuck with a $40 loss. I wouldnt recommend this over any other safety razor.

It’s light-weight and the material feels rather cheap. The power cord easily disconnects from the clock with every small movement. Also the buttons on mine were misplaced. The “M” button was suppose to be where the “-“ button is. I figured that out after struggling to set up the clock with the directions. The time display is pretty bright, even on the lowest setting so if you prefer sleeping with minimum amounts of light, I would not recommend this clock. The best thing about this clock is the large time display. It's easy to read from far distances. The alarm function wasn’t bad, just your typical alarm beeping sound. The alarm worked fine.

REALLY? Amazon refuses to, on their own, take care of this very evident fire and safety issue where they certainly would have born some responsibility had my house burned down and is forcing me to \"fix\" the problem on my own. Had I purchased this from target or another store I simply would have returned it for a new one, which is exactly what Amazon should be doing right now. The agent clearly did NOT understand what the real issue is and has caused me to rethink every purchase I make through them. I strongly suggest any reader seeing this to do the same. They could care less when they clearly are selling defective merchandise, they take zero responsibility and the consumer is on their own. Buyer beware, your house could easily burn down and they don't care! **UPDATE** I just posted this the day before yesterday and got no help from Amazon at all, and now the kettle won't shut off at all. You have to unplug it to get it to immediately start boiling water, it WILL NOT stop boiling until you unplug this extreme fire hazard.

Anyway, I have waited quite a while before reviewing this product hoping that my problems were just my imagination and that it would eventually work. Alas no. The dongle had issues from the get-go--if I plugged both an audio cable and a power cable into my phone at the same time, it would seem to work for a short while and then the iPhone volume would drop to zero. I could move the volume slider back up, but it would then drop back to zero making it impossible to listen to anything. It works fine if I just use either the power cable side or the audio cable side, but not both at the same time. This kinda defeats the purpose of it. Recently it just stopped working altogether and I would have to unplug the audio cable and plug it back in before it would start again. Recommendation? Do not purchase--save your money.",

The product inside is still amazing, maybe too much garlic now actually, but I love garlic so don't mind that. However there is no way to remove the top without breaking the container. So now I have to buy a spice grinder separate and carefully break this thing as to not fill it with plastic shards or lose half the bottle to transfer it to a new grinder. The only reason I will go through this hassle is the fact that no other spice company compares. I have looked far and wide for a garlic sea salt grinder to replace my empty one from olde Thompson.

They implied that I measured the dog wrong, and then told me to go to the two clip version, which their site says is old but their email says is new. Don't waste your money. I was excited to try this after reading the reviews. It is well-made, seems durable, and is reflective. The sizing chart is awful; i have it cinched ALL the way down small and it's just barely tight enough.

I have a 1.5 year old female boxer mix, about 65lbs. I don't think there's a harness or training technique we haven't tried to get her to behave on a walk. This was no different.

When I work out, I exercise vigorously. I go to the gym to get a good, intense workout in and usually come out sweating. I do both cardio and weights, but this device runs into the most problems when it comes to cardio. The heart rate tracker literally cannot read through my sweat. Yes you read that correctly - A FITNESS TRACKER CANNOT READ YOUR HEART RATE THROUGH SWEAT. How ironic. My heart rate will jump (during intense, steady-state cardio) from 165 to 110 to a blank screen (as you can see in the photo attached) to 150, then 98, etc. I contacted Fitbit customer service and was sent a replacement device. It also didn't work. Then, they sent me a SECOND replacement device. It also fails to accurately track my fitness stats. Given that this is the third device that has failed to record my stats, it clearly is their technology that is faulty. They refuse to reimburse me for their faulty product. If you actually care about exercising and want to do so with anything more than moderate intensity, don't even waste your money on this device. I'd recommend spending the extra $100-$300 on a Polar Watch or Apple Watch to get a product that will actually work for years at a time. I am so incredibly disappointed with this product and the Fitbit customer service team who, despite acknowledging the problem with their faulty technology, refuses to correct the situation with me.",

While using my headset I constantly hear the low battery beep, EVERY 15-30 SECONDS! It is noticeable enough to that using this headset has become such a nuisance. I have read many troubleshooting tips directly from the Logitech forms and they preach to keep your firmware up to date and the beeping will go away- well, that not true at all. I wish Logitech would release a firmware update to fix this problem instead of making me, the consumer, have to constantly update firmware and uninstall/reinstall software. I really would advise you to go with another headset until Logitech fixes errors on their end. This headset seemed great and had all the perks I was looking for, it just fell short with the troubleshooting that is obviously on their end, due to the number of reports I've read of people experiencing this same defect.

It has multiple pockets & all the zippers are functional & roomy. I only wish I could remove the small straps because I really don’t use them.

Why do we need to know that someone's hair looks coarse from across a room? I was surprised that it did not include the fabric content and a link to purchase their clothing as well. Pages of confusion in deciding who's lap Anita should sit on in a vehicle. I found myself constantly skipping ahead to find content that had some actual bearing on the story. It improved slightly after they arrived on the island, but I still found it lacking anything interesting. Anita didn't do anything in this story that a human woman couldn't have done.

It was not very comfortable and the band was very stiff overall (I thought it would get less stiff with time but it broke before I could confirm). Also the pins that latch the wrist band to the watch are not similar to the ones on the wrist bands that come with the Fitbit. They were much longer and I could actually feel them pricking into my wrist. I would recommend the manufacturer try a bit harder to make a product that has specs more similar to the default product at least from a compatibility standpoint if I the comfort of the user isn’t enough of an incentive. I’m too lazy to return this, but if you’re the seller and see this please refund me. --------- Update from 1 to 3 stars: they sent me a new one after this post and it is functioning after a few days. My comment on the pins and need to wear-in still apply. ----- Back to 1 star. I wish there was a zero star. As I took off my backpack the replacement snapped/broke at the same place as the last one without me even noticing. I almost lost my fitbit but someone saw and handed it to me after it fell off. THIS WRISTBAND IS TRASH. I'm surprised that there are this many positive reviews. Probably becase their service is good and they send replacements.

Third step was to add another phone on the USB-A smart port, which I did, and to my surprise the tablet stopped charging...I unplugged the usb-a the tablet started charging again...bottom line the USB-a ports can NOT be used with the usb-c charging port... Bottom line, if you want to buy this charger keep in mind you can only use 2 ports, or the 3 USB-A ports... Buying this for the usb-a ports is not worth the money, buying this for the usb-c and quick charge port, I guess its a good deal, hence the two stars... It also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable which is great, others in this price and even higher, dont.

The plot is filled with clichés about the nerdy high school girl who is bullied and yearns to be popular but is just to damn quirky to fit in including the stupid side kick who is loyal but likewise an outcast. However the thing that bothered me most was the not so subtle occult theme throughout the movie. In the end the girl ends up having essentially the power of a God and she is tasked with saving the planet from the evil scourge of humanity...oh and she's gonna birth the savior as well. I was confused as to whether she was gonna save the planet with her powers or usher in the savior as the prophecy foretold. Whatever, the movie abruptly ends with her declaring she wants to help after resurrecting and healing several friends who had just had an accident. I felt the acting was on par with the budget which wasn't much I'm guessing. Some decent actors who's careers are over and they just don't know it yet lol...There's a whole sequence in there about how evil humans are destroying the planet and global warming and such which was a turn off to me as well.

These methods had previously worked for another Marathon model (slim jumbo wall clock), when it took around 30 minutes to sync (again, after some manual intervention). I’m in the Bay Area, if it helps. Anyway, after all attempts at automatic and manual syncing failed, I was forced to program the clock manually — the process was a bit tedious, if you ask me. Bought it in the white & gold, and it looks and works fine otherwise — as a regular digital desk clock, I mean, just not as an atomic one. And since it was rather cheap, I won’t complain *too* much. I’m actually glad that it’s not constantly backlit (with a bright light), because why would I want my bedroom bathed in neon orange light all night when I’m trying to sleep?! The screen lights up for a few seconds at the touch of a button (on top), so when I do want to tell the time at night, it’s not that complicated a process at all. The numbers are large enough and easy for me to read. The clarity of the numbers does depend on the viewing angle, as some reviewers have mentioned. The size of the clock is appropriate for a desk/alarm clock, IMO. Haven’t used it as an alarm clock, so have no insight to offer in that regard. So, all said and done, my biggest, and *only* grievance is that its absolute *main*, *featured* functionality, is totally non-functional and useless.

After a few more weeks, it started occasionally popping open. I tried adding a link to wear it looser or taking one out to wear it tighter and it happened either way. I wore it like that for a couple years, with it popping open once or twice a day. Since it is still a loop, even open, losing it wasn't an issue.

The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick. If you decide to purchase, don't allow it to get wet!",

I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor … so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as \"cool white\". I'd describe them as \"blue-white\".

I read someone’s review about the same problem before purchasing and had my fingers crossed hoping it wouldn’t happen to me... but it did :/ On the bright side, however, I was able to fit an entire dresser full of clothes into this bag! I had to get rid of my dresser and make more space in my room ASAP and had to purchase something quickly. I only bought one at first because I wanted to make sure I liked the product and also to see how much I could actually fit before getting more. When I first received the bag, I did not like the quality. I wanted to return it but found out returns were not accepted for this item. So I had no choice but to give it a try, and to my surprise, was able to fit all the clothes from my large dresser. I definitely did not expect everything to fit! I thought I would have for sure needed at least two. Anyway, I was very happy with my purchase at that point and didn’t have any problems either, so I ended up purchasing another one even though the price had increased. That, of course, was a mistake as the plastic from second bag tore the moment I lifted it with my clothes to set it aside. I haven’t touched the first bag since I put my clothes in it but I’m pretty sure if I touch it again, it will rip. The bag definitely saves you a ton of space but I would suggest looking elsewhere for a similar product that is better quality. It is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for a stronger quality bag that will last longer. This particular item, on the other hand, is cheaply made and is not worth the price, unless the cost is less than $5. Yes, I was able to fit everything in the bag but what good does that do for me if the bag is ripped up? Keep in my mind the bag is lightweight only because it’s made from very cheap quality.

Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games.

However, I did have a problem with it moving to the right while holding it perfectly still. Time to test the buttons. OK, vol -/+, pg -/+ and mute worked fine but that is all. I have to use a home/menu button in order to use my remote but the Air Remote menu button did nothing. Ok, so I will program it. Followed all directions, repeatedly.

We bought this because the range on our handheld monitor just wasn't far enough to reach the backyard and the battery life was short so we had to bring the plug everywhere. We figured we'd get a camera we could monitor from our phones. This has AMAZING picture quality and I can clearly zoom in and see the baby breathing. However, you can't just leave the sound on all the time so you'd know if baby was crying at night and hear them. You have to physically open the app, make sure the sound is on and then you'd know if they're crying. That's a HUGE flaw for me... I'd prefer it continually run in the background so you can hear sound (don't need the picture all the time, just the sound)... I suppose you could possibly leave your phone on all night long and leave it on for sound but I'm sure that's not good for your phone...",

For JMBamboo shipping in long and plant conditions aren't that great at all due to long shipping time also comparatively bad packaging. My prayer plant took almost a week to arrive. It was in alright condition with tips of all the leaves turned brown due to completely dry soil. I moved it to a small pot 4 inch pot. After few days i decided to move it into a bigger pot. Thats when I realized oh there is a big insect living in the roots of the plant. Thanks of ofcourse the seller. I am glad i decided to repot and found it before it could do more damage to roots of my plant. Also, the soil in which this plant came was not at all good for the plant as it would dry out completely within a day or two whereas this plant needs moist soil not sandy dry soil. I also ordered photos with prayer plant from JMBamboo and when i repotted it, I saw it just had 2 main plant stems with roots rest were just small small cutting stuffed in the soil in the hope that they will propagate.

Mine is clean as shown in the picture and I didn't notice any strong smells,just a faint odor that went away after a day or two. I took a picture after it stopped expanding,and while the covering was slightly loose in one area,the bed looks pretty. I have back problems and this mattress has NOT helped. I purposely waited to write this review after sleeping on it for a week. One review said the bed felt soft and firm at the same time and I wondered how could that be? I don't know but she was right! If you like a firm mattress then you'll probably like this,though some said it gets softer as time goes on. I personally have been having back pain every morning so I will be adding a soft foam topper to put over it! I'm a senior and my daughter and I (mostly my daughter) put this on top of the Xl Twin box springs that came in a King frame I ordered. So after having to get rid of my old bed and all the money I paid for a new King size frame, and new box springs and the bed in a box I was not going to donate it and get a receipt like I've read that Zinus has you do in order to get a refund!!! I read from one review that a guy called Amazon and they helped him so I gave it a shot! I explained that I didn't want to return the bed, but since I was paying for a 12\" bed and my bed is only 10\" that I should get a discount and that's what they did! They adjusted my bill and I am VERY happy with AMAZON! I will update this review after I buy my new topper!",

The legs and lower torso were great, but it’s IMPOSSIBLE to keep the top from rolling down if you don’t have a flat stomach, and if you have a flat stomach you don’t need spanx. The moment the top of them hits a soft spot, they roll down into this right roll that digs in and creates a muffin top mid-torso. Which gives you two rolls instead of nicely and smoothly shaping the ones you already have and bought the torture garment to hide. And it basically feels like a cake wire trying to cut your muffin in half.

Once it warms up (and it takes a while) it is not half bad. But the killer is the trimmer head and trying to restring it. I'm not an angry or violent man, but just yesterday I had to walk away after 20 minutes before I just smashed this thing to pieces. The instructions are completely wrong....there is physically no way to string this thing as they say as the string cannot pass through. The old head was a bit of a pain, but it worked. This you have to take a screwdriver, pry (i.e., bend the heck out of it) to get it apart and then you have to wind both sides (one on top, one on bottom), then pray that you can line it back up and snap it back together. It's probably a two to three person job to be honest. When you get it started and warmed up and it's got a full head it works.

The radio comes on quietly for about 5 seconds and then becomes significantly too loud. When I read the directions, it says that the wake to radio volume setting can't be turned down, because they do not want you to inadvertently set it to no sound at all (and thus not wake you up). I appreciate the need for a minimum sound setting, but it should be one third of what it is now. You must turn off the radio once it wakes you up, because no one would ever want it this loud.

I have a few month old Tesla Model 3 and the TPMS indicated tires were low on pressure. All read about 37 PSI but when I hooked up this unit it read 30 PSI. I was a little skeptical but thought the TPMS sensors could be off. Aired up 2 tires to 42 PSI as indicated on the unit. I think turned on the car and one tire read 49 PSI and the other 46 PSI. I then pulled out the tire pressure gauge and sure enough 49 / 46 PSI when the unit read 42 PSI on both. I then tried another tire subtracting for the 5-7 PSI difference and found when I stopped the PSI on the gauge fluctuated about 2 PSI. This is just not acceptable.

            "input": "The premise of this movie is good enough: it is a redemption story of a spoiled rich kid who has to learn some life lessons to become a better person. In particular, he has to learn there's a lot more to life than money. There are several mini-lessons that the lead character is supposed to learn, and the lessons themselves are in fact good lessons to learn. There's nothing wrong with using a movie format to showcase valid ethical principles. But the writing, acting, directing, storyline, plot devices, dialog, and other aspects of the execution leave a lot to be desired. All aspects of this film betray an amateur level of skill and experience in film-making. That's not a terrible thing, I suppose. If you accept this as an amateur-quality film, you can forgive it for coming across as such. But the whole movie comes across as an extended Christian Facebook meme (probably written in all caps, with a note at the bottom saying something like \"How many of you love God enough to forward this to all your friends?\"), or like one of those contrived emails forwarded (over and over) from your sweet and elderly aunt who wants to remind everyone who deeply she believes Jesus loves them. The lines written for the child, Emily, are meant to be sassy and unexpectedly insightful for a child. She's kind of the all-knowing truth-teller in this story. It's an improbable setup, and unfortunately nothing about this plot device comes across in the least bit believable. They are lines obviously written by an adult, and the acting by the child and others in the scenes simply doesn't work. But again, seen from an amateur perspective, some of that is forgivable. What may bother me most about the movie is that the story arc actually ends up completely undercutting and essentially negating the original moral premise (or what I thought was the original moral premise) by the time the film is over. Rather than concluding with the idea that life can be good and ethical without wealth, it ends up teaching some sort of Prosperity Gospel idea (the idea that \"righteousness\" will be rewarded in measurable worldly gains, i.e. wealth). It turns out that morality of wealth itself is not examined or challenged in this film, despite the many scenes in which wealthy people are painted as superficial, petty, and unethical. The film does not challenge where the wealth came from (oil, in this case, which is dripping in moral dilemmas), and the film does not challenge the idea of so much wealth ending up in so few hands. Wealth itself is an ethical topic worth dissecting, especially in the context of Christianity, which this film does a heavy-handed job of promoting. \"Blessed are the poor,\" said the original Christian, and \"it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" So much for those ideas. The makers of this movie subscribe to a selectively abbreviated version of their own faith tradition.",

The tank is regularly maintained and nothing else in the tank is having the same issue. The other problem I'm experiencing, is that there has been some paint peeling on the inside.

I'm told that outside noise is louder and clearer than I am. I've tried adjusting the position of the buds in as many ways as I can think of, and nothing helps. So if you're looking for clear phone calls where you don't have to raise your voice for people to understand you, look elsewhere. However, hearing other people is no problem. Listening to music is wonderful. If you wear these without active sound playing, you can hear a slight hiss if everything around you is quiet, but it's not really an issue in my opinion. If you're active, they will need constant adjustment. You'll feel then loosening as you move. I luckily caught one of the buds before it fell out of my ear once. I use the medium size earpieces, and tried the large size, which were painful after a while. All in all, they're good for the price if you want them solely for listening at a desk or walking somewhere. For phone calls, working out, and running, look for something else.",

I am not sure if the back up camera module that I got is wrong one but I am 100% sure it is not 1080P. I have attached the pictures of front and back so you can see the difference very clearly the front one is perfect where as the back up one is lot distorted and the pixel are more choppy. Will try to post more photos later..... so if you are in market for a good 1080 P back up camera( which was my primary requirement) please see other products but if you are only interested in front 1080P cam then you can surely go ahead and buy this one.",

The comments tell you to grip the smooth front end with needle-nose pliers and then warns you to be careful not to damage the belt. But since that part is flush with the belt surface, the only way to grip it with needle-nose pliers is to dig into the leather to get the pliers around it. Some damage is almost assured if you do this. Poor design on an otherwise high quality belt. They could easily make the smooth front end with a flathead screwdriver slot just deep enough to get purchase to crack the glue. Then you'd just need two screwdrivers and no damage would occur.

Functionally, the case works well in charging the earbuds. Battery life feels a tad shorter than advertised. The earbuds pair as soon as you take it out of the case. The downfall is that the on earphone controls give you the option of being volume controls OR a pause play button. But not both. The big NO NO for me with these earbuds is that the bluetooth pairs with the right ear and from the right ear to the left, there is a delay in sound, which isn't too noticeable when just listening to music or taking phone calls, but is impossible to ignore when watching a video or making a video call. The sync is off by half a second and it makes videos nearly unwatchable. For me, while I mainly use these buds for music during workouts, I do make video calls and watch an occasional video and even these short stints become disturbing when the sound sync is off.

So, when they eventually broke back in July of this year I was tempted to buy a cheap pair of headphones but ended up deciding to spend the extra money and go with Sony again because of how much I loved the old ones which were now unavailable. These seemed to be the newer version of the old one I had so naturally I was expecting everything the old pair had and maybe even a better feel or sound quality. What I got was extremely disappointing. The Sound: actually a little bit worse than the old ones I had, simply just okay. The Quality/Feel: seemed like they were made extremely cheap and the uncomfortable feel of them showed that. I could maybe only wear these for about 30 minutes before it started hurting my ear and making me extremely uncomfortable. Not only that but now 2 and a half months after buying it the ear pad ripped completely off and (maybe I'm not too experienced with this and there is one) but I cannot figure out a way to put it back in. Overall, I would definitely not recommend these headphones for the price point that they're at. Even if I was given a $100 discount on these I still wouldn't even buy them again.

I had to connect with Google fit which eventually pulled all data from any device into its app. I could NOT download the heart-rate data, but that's typical with Google Fit. BUT, I could not turn off the heart rate monitor. At times I would just see a flashing green light under the watch that would continue for 5-15 minutes while the watch was off. It would happen some time during the day, and then other times after a work-out when I'm trying to shower, I'd take off the watch and it would just do that. Some time when I got back from the shower, it would still be flashing and then I'd put it back on. The battery is the one thing that kills me...when I have it connected to my phone, it will go from 6:30am when I get out till about 2 or 3pm, then I put it in airplane mode to last till about 4 or 5pm, and then the screen goes dark because it's only at like 5% and will only turn on when I push the button. Currently, I can not get it to hold a charge. It says it's charging, but it was like that for 2-days now and so i'm writing this review. Pros: Light weight, loved the white color that I received. No \"flat tire\" display, integrated heart-rate monitor and transfers data to google fit. Received notifications and calls. Cons: Battery drained quickly with my usage...I didn't even answer calls on the watch. Call quality when I did use it was horrible.

If I had worn them longer than an hour, it would hurt my ears. Not enough padding. Mine are now broken. I would say these are the worse headphones I have ever used. Mine are now broken. So the material is not good for the price, at the time I bought these headphones they cost 88 dollars. This is the second sony headphones that have broke on me. I am very cautious, I take good care of my stuff. I think the lifespan of this type of headphones is just 2 years. I don't think the price is reasonable for this type of headphone. I don't know if the best play for headphones is 300 dollars ones, I have never invested that amount of money into headphones. I feel like if headphones are something you use daily, then investing in 300 dollar headphones might be the best bet. If said 300 dollar headphones last longer than at least 5 years. I wouldn't purchase these headphones again. I waited to write the review on these headphones, specifically for this reason. If you are going to buy cheap headphones, don't buy this.

Most times one side gets stuck on the clip in the headliner and you have to hold the clip so that the shade can come down. Also, I'm not sure if the tab on mine was defective or cheap, but it tore right off from the shade. This surprised me because unless its raining or I'm driving at night I leave it alone. I may have put it up and down a total of 10 to 15 times at the most before it broke. Its more of a pain now to bring up, but I never really used the tab to put it down as the shade would always get stuck in a clip. Pros: -Looks great -Easy to install -Blocks the sun, but you can still see Cons: -Durability -difficulty to put the shade down (you will need to use 2 hands, and in my case I have to use 2 hands now to bring it up as well since the tab broke) I'm not exactly sure I would recommend this product. I guess I would ask the buyer if they really cared how easy it was to put up and down and if they cared if they had to use 2 hands to do so.

The lenses are polarized, but it's not the same as what you would find on a nice pair of Ray Bans or Maui Jims. It's very dark and blocks certain colors. The logo on the side of the arm is tacky and immediately noticeable at a glance. They're wide at the eyebrow and had to be bent a bit to make them even. The nose pads are uncomfortable and rigid, so if you wear your sunglasses a little lower than placing the pads directly between your eyes, they're not going to work for you.

After the mirror fell, I examined the bottom of the frame, and the wood was completely split, causing the leg to come off. It's a shame, because the mirror was a centerpiece in my living room. It had such a pretty cherry finish and a \"vintage\" appeal. I agree with another reviewer that said kids and this mirror don't mix. After the mirror fell and was flat on the ground, my 7 year old wasn't looking where he was going and stepped on it, shattering the glass to pieces.

I received the replacement parts rather quickly but they were a different color white than the rest of the bed frame. When I reached out to the company's customer service I was told the colors can vary from batch to batch. Unfortunately this wasn't helpful as I now have a mismatched bed frame that I can't use unless I choose to paint it. I was also told by company customer service that they could send me another bed frame but couldn't guarantee that it would be the whiter white color. Seems like poor quality control.

The second and more concerning issue is the reservoir is easy to overfill as the reservoir design makes it difficult to see the water level. I would suggest measuring the water in the carafe and then pouring it into the reservoir. The concerning thing is my wife filled it using a Britta pitcher and probably put in about 10 cups and when the maker transitioned from heating to brewing the maker kept popping the GFCI outlet. Moved it to a different outlet as I was thinking the outlet might have been overly sensitive. This GFCI outlet blew as well.

Unfortunately, the interface is not the same as the older VIA devices which were the same as the older TomTom GO devices.

The new computer update app seems to forget logins as well as being pseudo-web-based (read as \"unstable\"). When powering on, the new GPS chipset did detect the location in the house, which the old versions could not do. After finally inputting an address with a stylus, it found a route quickly and accurately during setup. At least this version has an SD card slot that support 32GB. It was purchased for my mother and she seems happy with it (surprisingly since she does not like interface changes on Windows, TVs, tablets or phones). I honestly hate the input lag and lack of touchscreen responsiveness, the missing features, and the new interface though... so I averaged her 4 stars with my one star to give two stars. TomTom should also add back all of the BlueTooth phone and music options that it used to have, as many of us do not drive cars with Bluetooth nor even have stereo input options for music devices. When testing it, though the location detection and destination routing were ok, I found it was difficult to change routers or destinations quickly when pulling over to do so and I hated using a stylus... due to this and the loss of features, I guess my next device might be a Garmin instead of the TomTom family I have always used.

They look better than the cheaper knob-based thermostats, but they don't work any better. The units generate enough heat to cause the thermostat to have false readings and the room temp fluctuates in a range of about 10 degrees over a 30 minute period. That's more than enough to go from feeling really cold to really hot. 1) The face plate generates heat, so the temperature is offset slightly. If this was the only problem you could just set the thermostat slightly higher to account for the change. 2) However, when the heaters turn on, the flow of electricity causes the unit to heat up unpredictably because of the variable flow. This makes the temperature reading fluctuate unpredictably and you get wild temperature swings. The actual temperature in my living room swings between 66 and 75 degrees over a 24-hour period when I set the thermostat to 72 degrees.",

Sometimes it disconnects after about 20 minutes, sometimes it's 5 minutes. When it disconnects I need to turn the headphones off, then back on again for them to reconnect. It's very common for me to go through this process about 3-4 times in an hour long meeting. Each cycle of turning my headphones off, then on again takes about 30 seconds. The call doesn't hang up, it just disconnects the headphones from whatever device I'm on and the call continues. Sometimes when i'm talking I don't even realize the headphones disconnected, there's no warning, so one second I'm talking then I go silent to everyone else. I've reached out to support 3 time, finally got a response and they said I needed to send the headphones in for a replacement which will take 6-8 weeks. Having said all the above, take the calling issues out of the equation these are the best headphones I've ever had. If you fly a lot and binge movies these bad boys will last without charge on a long-haul to the other side of the world. I've taken these with me to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and China long-hauls. Adaptive noise cancelling is awesome, although I do find myself always maxing out the noise cancelling. Being able to pull the headphones and having them automatically pause is a nice feature that works great. As an example, if you're sitting on an airplane in the middle of a movie and the flight attendant comes by to give snacks and drinks, or you're sitting in an exit row and they just need to hear you say \"Yes\" the headphones will pause whatever you're watching until you put them back on again. If you're not wanting to make phone calls with these headphones they're 5-start headphones, and as far as I'm concerned the best on the market. If you're needing to make a lot of calls, I'd recommend the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.",

But nonetheless, I went ahead with my build, until at 2am, as I try my first boot and all I get is a light show, no post, no display. While the board looked really nice in my custom PC and offered RGB and two m.2 slots (which I really wanted), sadly it refused to detect my brand new Ryzen 1700 and couldn't post. Interestingly enough, while the system was powered on, the board was able to provide power to the cpu cooler and the DIMMs but did not light up its own rgb areas. In the end I turned to the used Gigabyte B350 board I bought on craigslist for a backup! Buddy of mine said that most x370 boards are over-priced and now I know why. I went back and forth multiple times between boards to test different configurations (i.e. only 1 DIMM, etc.) and ultimately called it quits on this board. Not sure if the malfunction was due to handling, but I doubt it was a QA issue as this board was refurb iirc. Either way this was a headache for my first computer build, but also tested my ability to isolate hardware errors. Pics: 1 - Box, unopened - arrived as pictured, no packing material and with about 1-2 inch extra room on top and sides of the box (too big?) 2 & 3 - Box, opened - Shows small puncture in mobo box as well as a crunched corner (suggesting lots of movement inside of box, possibly previous wear and tear) 4, 5 & 6 - Box unopened - shows extent of wear on outer box, busted tape 7 - The MSI board plugged in with everything else lit up.",

The downside is that your product can very easily be overlooked when you're met with a bad experience from a customer service representative. I called their phone number listed here on Amazon because I had lost a glove earlier this year when I moved and figured I would just ask if it was possible to buy only one. I was expecting a no because I understand the costs and measurements could be different between gloves, as the representative let me know, but I wasn't expecting her to be so rude about it. After I had asked I was met with a strong and loud \"NOPE! Nope!\" in more of a condescending manner as if I was asking for another one for free. Then proceeded to try to inform me in a rude way why they can't do that. I'm saddened by the way this was handled, I wish there were other gloves of this quality on the market for around the same price because I'd rather buy those than from a company that left such a poor taste.",

There are parts in the kit that are not explained in the instructions, but are required for install, and the illustrations do not make it clear where to put the different spacers. Once installed, the wheel carrier impacted the bolt heads holding the 2nd rail brackets, and though the bracket holes are slotted, there are no instructions stating that you need to fully extend the brackets before tightening the bolts. There is no explanation about installing the door stops, so if you just install the stops at the end of the bar, both doors will slide the full extent of the bar, instead of perhaps stopping one door part way so that the 2nd door can bypass it and close the opening. Making an adjustment after the fact requires significant disassembly. Finally, the number of washers provided is insufficient to prevent the end of the bolt on the inboard most rail from extending through the bracket so far that it impacts the slider for the inboard door. This required adding washers and then finding a suitable paint to match them to the rest of the hardware. The ONLY reason that I gave this a 2-star instead of 1 star is because the actual hardware is solid and well-finished.",

They offer great noise control on airplanes, and otherwise sufficiently dull ambient hum and office chatter to allow you to focus (but they do not create \"silence\" or anything near it). The noise canceling is good enough to allow me to listen to podcasts and music while vacuuming. But there are several important issues with the product: 1) There is a subtle popping when used on buses and trains and sometimes when walking (or at least this is the case for my product). I think it has something to do with the noise canceling feature when the product is vibrated or exposed to small pressure changes. I had noticed this once or twice in the first year of use, but it didn't both me since I wasn't using it in those settings. But as my usage increased in these settings it became unbearable. Now I am taking the bus weekly and the product is effectively unusable. The warranty expired before I realized this might be covered, and I resent that Bose offers a default 2-year warranty in Europe but not in the U.S. 2) The ear-cuff material has degraded (cracking, flaking) despite careful use on my part. I take pains to keep the material clean and away from chemicals (always storing in the case when not wearing it), and I am disappointed that it seems this is not a product that will last for a long time after all. 3) The controls and software are clumsy and distracting. The advent of the app has allowed me to turn off the very annoying robot repeatedly listing the devices I am connected to (or not). The beeps however cannot be turned off nor can their volume be adjusted, resulting in loud noises that are unwelcome and frustrating. 4) The microphone design picks up ambient noise and amplifies it for a person on the other end of phone calls. Consequently, distant barking and ambulances can be louder than you to the listener. This is particularly a problem with crinkling sounds, which I have been told are extremely vivid to those on the other end of the line. I have not tried out the Bose competitors, but until these issues are resolved I'm planning to for my next purchase.",

I didn’t notice this until I had worn them for a few hours. :( I don’t know if this is typical or just a fluke that got by Quality Control. If not for that one Con, these would be the perfect flip flops. If you have a foot on the wider side, these will fit you well. EDITED to add: I took these on vacation as my only pair of shoes and they were killing me! The short toe strap dug into my foot requiring a bandaid every day. Also, the edge of the strap on the top of my foot rubbed my foot raw. I have scarred/healed rubbed off skin area on my feet now. Yikes! Too bad because the footbed is incredibly comfortable and the style is cute. I have to change my four star review to 2 stars because I can’t wear them and they gave me broken skin and scars.

As it is, I eat through the batteries faster than they can get any meaningful charge (5 minutes isn't enough for anything) and have to stop mowing to simply allow the batteries to charge. I'd need at least three batteries and two chargers and swap every 10 minutes to work continuously. My suggestion is to stick with gas if you have the type of grass that people compliment. Very disappointed considering the cost. Edit: At the close of the 2019 cutting season, we're still using the mower because I'm too cheap to buy another mower. It's held up well and we can accomplish mowing with two 4ah and a single 2ah battery (normally without charging required). Due to the thickness, it takes almost twice as long as a gas mower simply because it isn't as powerful and will bog down and not cut (note that I came from the gas size they say is equivalent - not at all true). It does a lot better if bagging - just stinks at mulching. Still wish I never made the mower purchase, but the other tools in the line are good. At least it is quiet and doesn't smell while also requiring only blade maintenance. Due to life we've had and maintenance, I added a star back.",

This is fun for 20 seconds, then you are tired from the running. It is not just my opinion, but my kids as well. They play soccer and in good shape, and didn't feel like this product added anything to the training. I think it is a waste of your money to buy this thinking you will get good use out of it in a training session. I rarely put down a product, but it is simply not living up to its claims. Save your money and get something else instead. If you already bought one, try to return it. Otherwise just tie a GI-Joe doll to it (or Barbie) and throw it from a high place for some parachute fun.

            "input": "Pros: Shipped fast Pros: Mounts up on Wall, out of the way. Pros: Nice, long hose Pros: Filter can be cleaned out and reused - saving $$$. Cons: Terrible suction for a brand new vacuum! It picked up dust and what not, but only if you went real slow, and kept the floor attachment tool angled as flat as possible to the surface being vacuumed. If you tilt it up as you moved it back and forth, it just doesn't have much suction to pick up anything - requiring you to go over and over the same area several times. Then you still end up picking up small objects left behind, by hand. This brand- new vacuum would not pick up some small pieces of broken glass; nor even small wood chips; let alone small metal shavings the weight of a paperclip. Note: The suction was poor even even after I emptied, and cleaned the filter. (I went and got my Hoover house vacuum, and found it had no problem picking this glass, wood & metal debris this vacuum couldn't suck up.) Not impressed with suction, and will be contacting Craftsman on this matter. Con's: For a wall mount vacuum, I found it to be a clumsy, poor design - as it required repeatedly removing vacuum off from wall bracket, just to dump out debris into garbage (and clean filter), each & every time it kept losing suction. (Which seemed to happen right away when vacuuming up any fine particle debris. So you either need to just take the vacuum of the wall and drag it behind you - or keep remounting vacuum back onto wall bracket (& plug cord back in) just to use it again. (My intent was to leave the vacuum on the wall, and use it. I had a prior wall mounted vacuum that allowed you to just remove just the dust-bin container that needs dumped - and not have to remove the entire heavy motor assembly.) If you are buying this shop vacuum to drag behind you...and then put back into the wall storage bracket between use, then you may find this design adequate. But, if your intent was to leave the vacuum hanging on the wall, and use the long hose to reach around the entire shop to vacuum - think twice about this product.",

The entire tops of these shoe is a mesh type of material that breaths very well. No soo good when dealing with winter weather though. I love the slip on aspect of the shoe due to the nature of my work. However that backs of the shoe likes to bunch up when putting them on and it's not exactly easy to fix once your foot is in the shoe. You have to take measures to prevent that as your foot slides into the show. This is the reason behind my low rating of these shoes: First off the tread collects everything due to the small gaps in the tread. If you are out in the rain, snow, or mud you will carry that stuff on the bottom of your shoe for a very long time once you come in doors. Water doesn't even clean out very well. So tracking even water becomes an issue. These are also worthless in the snow or ice. Very slick and absolutely no traction. I fell at work due to this problem. Wet floors is even a problem. My biggest issue with these shoes is a manufacturer defect. There is some sort of seam right next to my big toe witch that had caused me to stop wearing the shoes. It hurts and causes me to walk in a way to try and avoid it. This causes a tremendous amount of pain in my feed by the end of the day.
