Also, the context provides more information about the sentence or the character. Your task is to write the character's motivation by doing a specific job, which is given in the sentence. You can use context to find the motivation; however, all the inputs do not provide context. Also, in some inputs, there can be zero motivation; output, 'None' in this case.",
