This is a theft of public resources on a scale unheard of. $21 million daily going down the pipe. SB21 written by oil lawyers and passed by oil employees posing as Legislators has defrauded the people. SB21 must be repealed along with tax credits.

After birth, humans have many years to make a decision as to what their sexuality will be or even may be born understanding what their sexuality will be at sexual maturity. Some may even identify as being a different sex than at birth.

A more clinical curriculum with opportunities to ask real questions and have them answered without shame seems crucial for all young people, not just those lucky enough to grow up with informed and open parents willing to address the issues over the course of a child's development. I'd say the same for immunizations or other public health issues or if families decided that they only wanted their sons and not their daughters educated.
