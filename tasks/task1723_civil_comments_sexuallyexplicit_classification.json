This is a theft of public resources on a scale unheard of. $21 million daily going down the pipe. SB21 written by oil lawyers and passed by oil employees posing as Legislators has defrauded the people. SB21 must be repealed along with tax credits.

After birth, humans have many years to make a decision as to what their sexuality will be or even may be born understanding what their sexuality will be at sexual maturity. Some may even identify as being a different sex than at birth.

Because gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces, it takes truly massive objects to make gravitational waves we can detect.  Everybody expected gravitational waves to exist, the challenge was to make a receiver sensitive enough to detect them.  Basically no practical importance as far as human existence is concerned.

And the lawsuits by Cayetano, Work on rail was never stopped by a court order on any of the lawsuits brought on by Cayetano and company.  What about the delays caused by the city.  Issuing contracts in 2009  yet never got the ok to start construction by the FTA until 2012.  You need to stop blaming others and start putting blame where it belongs.  All delays were fault and caused by the city.  If the city had not rushed this project, and done everything by the book, none of this would have happened.",

I find it odd that you believe that if I have more money than you, that I should have more free speech. This is the fatal flaw in the court decision, that money equates free speech. This is intellectual lunacy. Free speech, the courts have previously ruled must be protected at all costs, especially when the protected free speech is the opinion of the smallest minority. If you have $1000 dollars and I have $10, you have more free speech than me based on the Citizens United decision.
