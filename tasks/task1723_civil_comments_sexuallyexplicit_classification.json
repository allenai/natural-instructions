A lot may have to do with inability of the shift supervisors and their immediate superiors to stand up for the rank and file. Long before Dean Williams was tossing officers under the bus has become a culture for some who wears the stripes and bars. When they change out of the uniform and into a suit, something weird happens. \n\nAlso, and I say this very gently that correctional facilities should be run by former correctional officers.

I immediately felt disgust and anger for Brown. However, after reading how some of the anti-Brown camp has been talking to those who don't agree with them and the negative comments about Brown, I started finding it difficult to completely side with the Hutchinson camp because the energy seems very controlling, angry and aggressive toward different views expressed here. There's this energy of needing to be right. I just don't see how fighting negativity with more negativity is productive. I REALLY understand the pain, anger and feelings of betrayal. But is there not anyone here with a calm, level head that is willing to discuss different views without judging those who seem judgmental? Or someone that has compassion for all parties involved and is looking for the best for everyone thats high vibration? Thank you",

A more clinical curriculum with opportunities to ask real questions and have them answered without shame seems crucial for all young people, not just those lucky enough to grow up with informed and open parents willing to address the issues over the course of a child's development. I'd say the same for immunizations or other public health issues or if families decided that they only wanted their sons and not their daughters educated.
