        "In this task, you are given a text from a post. Your task is to find all of the proper nouns and label them. The labels are <B-PER>, <I-PER> for persons; <B-ORG>, <I-ORG> for organizations; <B-LOC>, <I-LOC> for locations; and <B-MISC>, <I-MISC> for other nouns. The capital 'B' denotes the first word of a proper noun phrase. The capital 'I' denotes all following words of the same noun phrase. If a word is not a part of a proper noun phrase, do not label it."
