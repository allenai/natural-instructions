    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a text from a post. Your task is to find all of the proper nouns and label them. The labels are <B-PER>, <I-PER> for persons; <B-ORG>, <I-ORG> for organizations; <B-LOC>, <I-LOC> for locations; and <B-MISC>, <I-MISC> for other nouns. The capital 'B' denotes the first word of a proper noun phrase. The capital 'I' denotes all following words of the same noun phrase. If a word is not a part of a proper noun phrase, do not label it.",

            "explanation": "This is how the labeling should be. San Diego is the name of a location. In addition, it cannot be separated and is represented by two words. Therefore the labeling is San <B-LOC> Diego <I-LOC>. For the other locations mentioned in this sentence, they are single word locations and are represented with the label <B-LOC>."

            "explanation": "Eli Lilly a two-word representation of a company. Therefore, it gets the label Eli <B-ORG> Lilly <I-ORG>. IVAC is the name of a company. It gets IVAC <B-ORG>.
