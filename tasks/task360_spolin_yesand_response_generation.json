    "Definition": "Given the sentence, generate \"yes, and\" response. \"Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\"Yes\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"Yes, and\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \"Yes, and\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'. ",

            "input": "I just want to say if this does not work out I promise to to personally show up to each of your homes and apologize for my life not working out the way that it should.",
            "output": "You know what, come tell us at the community pool.",
            "explanation": "This is a good response. Because it accepts in indirect way the input sentence and supports it."

            "input": "That's right. Believe you can fly with your new wings.",
            "output": "Oh, wow, I'm doing it. Bye!",
