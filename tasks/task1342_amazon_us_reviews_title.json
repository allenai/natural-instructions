I can tap the sides of both monitors, there is much more &#34;shake&#34; on this new monitor than the older one.<br /><br />It also seems to have a problem &#34;waking up&#34; when the computer has sat for a while.

The lighting is gentle on the eyes and I am no longer struggling to find those seldom used keys on the fringes of the keyboard.  I chose this keyboard over the back lighted gaming keyboard because I wanted a quieter keyboard with less key travel with a feel similar to what I have on the laptop.  Again, this keyboard did not disappoint. For many years I have been using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I was concerned that going back to the standard shaped keyboard would aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome, however the shortened key travel and pressure seems to help mitigate the symptoms.  I highly recommend this keyboard.",

My father in law had one. So I decided to buy it because of the unique setup on the left side of the keyboard. I was not disappointed! This keyboard has not only served me well in World of Warcraft, but also several other games as well. all played Dailey. A few of the keys started sticking last year so I replaced it. However I do think I could fix it and get it back up to running again.<br />  I thought that the Merc Stealth keyboard was no longer in production or I would have bought another one in a heartbeat!!!

The only area that I feel needs clarifying is that the monitor can only display WQHD (1440) graphics on Dual Link DVI graphics interfaces with the Dual Link DVI cable or the Displayport. The VGA and HMDI interfaces cannot  go past HD resolution. This resulted in my needing to get a suitable graphics card and cable. This can be harder than it seems as most DVI are single link.  I found an EVGA card with an Nvidia GeForce GT610 GPU with 1 GB of ram works fabulously with my standard HP Pavillion power supply and delivers excellent performance.

The wireless antenna (located adjacent to the display cable) interferes with the display. The screen flickers all the time. At the begging, it used to go away when I restart the machine so I though it was a software bug. However, it got worse and now every time I connect to 2.4Ghz wireless network it flickers. Look it up in youtube and google (rMBP screen flicker).<br /><br />2 other minor issues:<br /><br />- LG display ghosting problem.<br />- It gets hot.<br /><br />My advise:<br />- Before you buy it, make sure you get the model with the Samsung screen not the LG model. If you get the model with the LG display return it. It will give your hard time.<br /><br />- Get apple care. Aside from the display, the fan seems it's about to fail. So having an applecare will protect your investment. I contacted apple regarding the wirless antenna issues since it's a design issue and my warranty expired.

I have the iPad 2 and the case fits like a glove. All the proper &#34;cut outs&#34; line up fine. I don't really use the camera much on my iPad, but the cutout is perfect in case i do. A HUGE thanks to Sinjon Vision who uploaded the photos. Honestly, those images are what sealed the deal for me. I met someone who had this case in red, which I had considered, but I wanted something a little different. The white stiching is a great contrast to the light brown color. The best part, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the velcro on the bottom of the part that holds the iPad. It's GREAT for positioning the iPad to many different angles, and it actually stays. My previous case (with no keyboard) has grooves to position the iPad but there are only two options and it kept slipping all the time: quite annoying. The ability to move the keyboard out is awesome! it gives you much more flexibilty so that you don't feel too cramped when typing. The keyboard is a little small to me, but that's not a big deal. I have fairly small hands. If you have larger hands, typing may be a little challenging unless you're accustomed to smaller keyboards; but if you really need a larger keyboard, my guess is that you'd be on a desktop or laptop and getting this case would be a moot point.  The only thing that could make this case even better is if the part that holds the iPad would pivot. Currently, the case is designed to hold the iPad in landscape mode only. This is great for typing with the keyboard, but when I read books or magazines, I prefer the portrait mode and it would be great to have the velcro feature in portrait mode. All in all, I love this case! And the price point is excellent. I paid half of the retail price. Can't beat it!",

I use this monitor for work, and it is outstanding for viewing documents and web pages. I have not used it for gaming or watching movies, so I can't comment on the image quality for those uses. I really like the fact that this monitor uses a scant 27 W.    The display's physical housing however, is a major disappointment (1 star for the housing):   - The display is wobbly on the base.   - The tilt adjustment is super stiff. It takes 2 hands and more force than I'd like to apply to the wobbly base to adjust the tilt (one hand to hold the base and one hand to hold the bezel).   - The bezel and base are gloss black, so they show every single fingerprint and smudge. Samsung seems to be aware of this issue because they included a cleaning cloth with the monitor that is NOT for the display area, but for the bezel and base! Hey Samsung, skip the cleaning cloth and use a finish that does not highlight every fingerprint and smudge! Another downside of a gloss black bezel is that it reflects light from adjacent light fixtures and windows, which I find to be a distraction. I have half a mind to get out some 400 grit sand paper and take care of the gloss finish once and for all.  - The base is some stylish post modern curved design that cannot be used to put anything on (e.g. won't hold a pen, a note pad, a paperclip, or my reading glasses), and is therefore a useless waste of my desk space.   - The touch controls on the lower right side are exactly where I grab the monitor to adjust its position. Every time I do this, I accidently shut the monitor off or activate some on-screen adjustment. I prefer buttons in the lower middle to avoid this issue and show deference to our left-handed friends.  - There are no VESA mounts on the back (in case that matters to you).    Finally, the power cord includes a power converter brick in the middle ofthe cord, which is an inconvenience.    So, I love the display image and hate the housing on this monitor, resulting in 3 stars overall. If my complaints about the housing are not things that would bother you, go for it. If you prefer a housing with a stable and useful base, an easy tilt adjustment, a non-reflective bezel, and/or VESA mounts then you should pick a different monitor.",

With the additional cells the battery profile has added about 3/4&#34; to the bottom of my laptop.  This actually works out nicely because it raises the back of the laptop slightly and makes the angle of the keyboard more comfortable (for me) to type on and gives a little more airflow for the fan to ventilate the unit.  The price point for this battery was a significant bonus, as the the HP version (if you can find one) is upwards of $70.

I should start by saying I haven't personally experienced this issues some customers have reported with the Kindle coming free of the case.  The Kindle and case secure to each other magnetically and, at least on the one I got, it's a secure fit.  I also haven't dropped my Kindle, so I can't speak to how well the case would protect the device in a fall, althogh it seems like it would probably be adequate in most cases.<br /><br />Some things I like about the case (in addition to the previously mentioned aesthetics) are the loop for a stylus, and the clever folding back that allows the Kindle to stand either horizontally for media viewing or vertically for reading.  I also like the way the Kindle keyboard fits into the case completing the set.  BUT...<br /><br />The devil's in the details, and some of the details end up being problematic.  The folding stand can't be used whiile the keyboard is in place, which isn't a huge deal, but might be a consideration for some customers.  A larger issue (which I also mentioned in my review of the keyboard itself) is the way in which the keyboard attaches to the case.  In order for the keyboard to magetically lock to the case, it is placed with the keys facing OUT, away from the case.  So, if you're using your Kindle as a reading device, or holding it on a plane, for example, and you have the keyboard attached, the case is folded open in such a way that your fingers are constantly pushing keys on the keyboard.  Naturally, this wakes the keyboard and can cause all sorts of problems.  Since the keyboard can't easily be used while it is in the case  anyway, it's too bad they didn't make it mount (or at least ABLE to mount in a position that would leave the keys inaccessible when it is mounted.<br /><br />That issue asiide, the case looks good, works well and has been a good companion to my Kindle.",

I liked the idea of having multiple positions/angles that it could be propped up at...unfortunately, this case doesn't work well at the steeper angle. If I prop it up it sometimes slips, and it definitely slips if I have it propped up & am using it w/ the stylus or my finger. Otherwise, I can deal with it at the lower angle most of the time...and like I said, when closed it offers good protection for everyday moving around / throwing in my purse, backpack, breifcase, etc. I like the color, and the stylus slides nicely on the outside at the fold...overall decent deal for the price.",

I opened the box, laid out all the gear inside, and began the process of installing the router.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned how easy it is to set up this router and they are correct for those people who are replacing an existing router with the new TP-Link reviewed here.  For those folks new to using a router, TP-Link makes your task easy by providing you with a Resource CD which takes you step by step through the installation process.<br /><br />Even though I have a router already in place, I decided to use the CD just to be sure that I got the maximum benefit from this new router.  I was pleased with the systematic and clear directions given on the installation Wizard.  In about ten minutes or less the Wizard told me installation was complete.<br /><br />Now to test the router, which is located in a third floor office in my home.  I went down to the first floor and turned on a HP Laptop with a Windows 7 operating system.  After initializing the computer to accept the new router, I opened Google first and then AOL.  Both browsers opened quickly, not quite as fast as the desktop computer that I am using to write this review, but fast nonetheless.  Good start.<br /><br />I decided to first bring up a video from YouTube - John Denver playing \\\\\"The Bells of Rhymney.\\\\\"  Perfect picture and excellent sound.  Next I went to NetFlix and clicked on \\\\\"Grand Hotel,\\\\\" a new Spanish film.  Again, excellent picture quality and sound.  The TP-Link works just as advertised.<br /><br />What about customer service?  Often it is difficult or impossible to get anyone on the phone to help if difficulty with new equipment is encountered.  Not so with TP-Link.  I was quickly connected to a tech adviser who talked to me about various features of this router.  He was competent and friendly.  I decided that if I ran into any problems with the router, help would be easily available.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Fast and easy to install, the TP-Link AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router works as advertised.  How will it hold up over time?  I will come back and update this review in a couple of months to discuss reliability issues with Amazon readers./>Bottom line.

            "input": "This kit consists of an indoor camera/transmitter, a USB receiver for your PC and software. I'm a PC expert, but a security system novice. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />Setup requires the following steps:<br />1) Find a place to mount the indoor camera. It must be within 10 feet of a power outlet, no exceptions. Mount the camera, plug it in the wall.<br />2) Load the software on your PC. The PC must be running Windows XP (any variety) or Vista. The installation is relatively painless.<br />3) Plug the receiver module into the wall and connect the receiver to your PC via USB.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />A) The requirement that the camera be within 10 feet of a wall outlet will create issues for some. It certainly did for me: There was no convenient outlet near the front door, which is where I would have preferred to mount the camera. (Remember that even if you have a convenient outlet, the cord is only 10 feet long, and you may not want the cord draped along the floor or whatever). As a result, I mounted the camera on the second floor to look down on the entryway porch--not my favorite choice, but good enough for now.<br />B) Because this system uses power-line ethernet (it uses the power lines in your home to do the networking), it is subject to the standard bugaboos of that approach, namely the connection can become flakey if you use certain appliances on your line (hair dryers are bad, for example), and the quality of the connection can also vary depending on where the transmitter and receiver are relative to the wiring.<br />C) The installation was relatively painless, but does require reboots and downloads to update the software.<br />D) You should plan for the PC to which you attach the receiver to be on 24/7, or at least at any time you want the camera system to work. If you expect to use this as a security monitoring system when you are gone, I would strongly recommend you put your PC on a good quality uninterruptable power supply (note that the receiver unit MUST be plugged directly into the wall, not the UPS, so if your power goes out, you will NOT get any camera feed until power is restored. But at least if your PC is on a UPS, transmission can start up again automatically when the power is restored).<br /><br />Use:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) I was surprised at the good quality image I was getting from the camera, given the inexpensive nature of this kit and the relatively low light in the area to which it was pointed. Thumbs up.<br />2) The control software is relative easy to use. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) This kit promises you can view your camera's output remotely. To me, that was probably the coolest thing. You could be in another city and keep an eye on your home. HOWEVER, it turns out that the only thing you can do without spending more money is watch the camera real-time. You can adjust the camera, and you can't review the video that your camera has captured remotely without paying $80/year to unlock additional features. I hate hidden cost software unlocks that are required to obtain the full usefulness of a product. This, in my opinion, pushes this kit down a full star (at least) in usefulness.<br /><br />2) No sound. I am not sure why I expected this kit to capture sound, and I am not even sure if it matters, but it was disappointing to discover that the camera is video only. I consider this a minor nit.<br /><br />Overall, I found that this kit exceeded my expectations in terms of the quality of the video that it captures, but that the powerline networking (with the limitation of a 10 foot power cord for the camera) and the $80 unlocking fee before remote operation is useful considerably reduce my overall happiness with the device. If they were to introduce a camera that used standard 802.1g wireless networking (either battery operated or capable of using a longer power cord), that would considerably increase the usefulness of the camera. If they would also stop with the $80 fee and just include all the features with the package (even if the package was priced higher), that could address the second issue.hat could address the second issue.",

They can save the pictures to their computer and then organize them by year then month.  Every couple of weeks they plug this drive in a back up their pictures.  While they are not using this drive they should keep it unplugged from their computer and in their safe.  (Another tip I gave them was that every year they should buy a USB thumb drive and save the previous calendar year to it as well).<br /><br />Using this drive in this fashion does not take advantage of any of the software features that it comes with nor does it touch on the life expectancy of it.  What it does though is allow for you to back up a ton of priceless pictures that would be devastating to lose.<br /><br />For us, the cost is great for what you get.  I have used many WD Passports and have never had a problem.<br /><br />-One tip that I will offer and you can take it if you wish...  I would not leave this (or any) USB drive plugged into your computer all of the time.  When you are not using the data that is on it it is best unplug it.  These drives have moving parts in them and the more they are used the more wear they take on.  Doing this will prolong their life.",

I was kind of irked about the fact that the battery life is more like 6 hours than the advertised 8.. I also had to reinstall the Synaptics Mouse driver because after installing my AT&T AirCard the touch pad just crapped out and refused to work. I also had to reinstall The APCI driver (works the keyboard) because the function keys stopped working. Both were easy to fix though.. just went to the Synaptics and the ASUS website and they had repair drivers there and easy to find.  Also, The webcam didn't come with any software? What's with that?      One thing I did really like though is the battery life-- I was going to purchase the same make and model from BestBuy for $299 but it came with 4 hours less of batter life- 4 HOURS!

Better software ... something with greater control of acceleration could certainly help, but I wan't able to do much with Logitech's included application.   I've returned the unit and am looking for a second choice.",

            "input": "I've owned about 3 different ACER laptops. All of them were great, but this one takes it to the next level.<br />------------------------------------<br />Windows 8:<br /><br />This laptop, when I first received it was very good. It worked, keyboard is very accurate, touchpad takes some getting used to. Windows 8 is OKAY. But the changes from windows 7 are a bit disappointing. It just doesn't have that &#34;windows feel&#34; anymore. I think Microsoft should rethink/rework the Windows 8 operating system a bit. It's too much to take in, and quite frankly, I think Microsoft is trying to 'copy' what Apple is doing; they're taking it way too far.<br /><br />Immediately, I was disappointed with Metro. I absolutely cannot manage without the start menu! As well, with this laptop, using metro is kind of difficult. The touch pad is kind of all over the place sometimes, and takes you some place you don't want to go. Basically, I'd just tap the touch pad gently and end up clicking something in metro accidentally. This caused me so much frustration!!!<br /><br />Overall, Windows 8 was just a huge disappointment to me. I don't know about anyone else, but I need more leeway when I use a computer.<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Linux Mint:<br /><br />So after about 2 weeks, I tried Linux. I put Linux Mint on it, and surprisingly, it worked really well!! However, the brightness and touchpad were not working properly. I managed to fix the brightness, but the touchpad was a bit buggy still. The problem with the touchpad was scrolling and right click. Right Click wouldn't work unless you used 'two fingers'. Which meant I had to tap the touch pad with two fingers. It was a minor annoyance. The wireless was another major issue. For some reason in Linux, the wireless card would constantly drop. And it also would take for ever to reconnect. The only way to reconnect fast enough was to restart the whole system.<br /><br />So pretty much, Linux needs a bit of updates for this laptop. The touchpad really works against you and does what ever it wants from time to time in Linux. And the wireless issue was just a huge turn off.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Windows 7 downgrade:<br /><br />And finally, 2 days ago, I downgraded back to windows 7. And guess what? IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY!!! It wasn't an actual downgrade, I had an OEM copy of windows 7 with a key to use. The performance difference between windows 7 and 8 on this laptop are VERY noticeable. Windows 8 kind of lags in desktop mode. But on Windows 7, I get no more lag, and everything runs smoothly.<br /><br />Acer is such a great company when it comes to drivers. Most companies will not provide Windows 7 drivers. The reason for this is because they want to force you to use windows 8. Acer however, understands a users preference, and offers Windows 7 drivers in case you feel uncomfortable with windows 8. SO ACER GETS MY THUMBS UP!<br /><br />All the drivers work, and I find the touch pad responds a lot better in Windows 7, compared to Windows 8 and Linux. Windows 7 works very well on this laptop, and I do recommend it if you want to downgrade to windows 7.<br /><br />All I did was plug in an external USB cd-rom, and installed windows 7 pretty much that way. It's very simple.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />PROS AND CONS<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1)Sleek<br />2)Runs decent<br />3)Intel HD 4000 can actually run some games. I'm not saying on high settings. Played Guild Wars 2, Left 4 dead, Killing Floor, etc; and they all run pretty well on this on low-med settings. But this isn't a gaming laptop, so don't expect anything like eye-candy gaming experience. This laptop serves it's purpose for me quite well.<br />4)i5 processor is SO GOOD!!!<br />5)USB 3, Bluetooth and HDMI<br />6)Overall Sexy silver look<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1)A bit flimsy (try not to rest anything heavy on it)<br />2)Network NIC (not the wireless). For some reason, an RJ45 cable refuses to fit properly in it. Don't know if that is a design flaw, or maybe I need better network cables.<br />3)Keyboard will betray you a few times. But this isn't a major con, it just takes some getting used to if you have big hands.<br />4)Battery could be better<br />5)....Wait stop. There are no more cons!<br /><br />Yeah this laptop is too good for any big cons. It's a very decent semi-Ultra Book.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />One more thing I noticed with this laptop, is it cannot get dirty! I usually leave my work spaces kind of messy after use. But this laptop has such a clean feel to it, you can hardly notice if there is a mess on it. I've had dust, pieces of hair, even some potato chips fall on it. It comes off very easily. Also, the Keyboard is fitted in a way, where it is impossible for any mess to get inside the laptop. Acer designed this so well, it's almost Dirt-Resistant!<br /><br />I don't normally make reviews on Amazon, so please consider getting this laptop. It will not disappoint you, even if you like windows 8!",

It's a flexible system with lots of options. For now I just want top use it for backup, but it can do much more.<br /><br />I finally went with the simplest option to start with, the basic setup with default settings and, for my Mac, a Time Machine backup. Even that had a few wrinkles, such as deciding how much space to allocate for Time Machine. (For those who use Time Machine, ReadyNAS helpfully automatically sets up a portion of the drives of the size the user specifies. By default Time Machine would use all the space available on the drives.)<br /><br />The setup and Time Machine backup went smoothly, no glitches. I needed to consult the ReadyNAS software manual (available online), and in some cases had to hunt a bit for the right button to click next.<br /><br />The fan that operates whenever the unit is on has a soft but quite noticeable sound.<br /><br />The two 1-TB drives that came with this system are [[ASIN:B008LA60NW Toshiba DT01ACA100 7200 RPM drives]] (from November and December 2013). User reviews at Amazon and NewEgg suggest these aren't the ultimate in reliability, though they generally perform well. They make the redundancy of the default X-RAID configuration desirable. (In that configuration, the total data that can be stored on the two 1-TB drives is only 1 TB because of the redundant storage. If one drive fails, all the data can be recovered from the other.)<br /><br />The Toshiba drives are supposed to be energy efficient, which is good, because the ReadyNAS keeps them spinning continually when the unit is on. You can schedule times for the unit to power up and down, and you can remotely shut it down fairly easily. Remotely powering it up is a little trickier, but can be done via Wake on LAN. NetGear says they're working on a disk spindown option for their next software update (6.2.0).<br /><br />Screws are included to mount 2.5\\\\\" drives.<br /><br />The power cord is helpfully long, a little over 11 feet, in two pieces with a power brick in the middle.<br /><br />The construction is solid.working on a disk spindown option for their next software update (6.2.0).<br /><br />Screws are included to mount 2.5\\\\\" drives.<br /><br />The power cord is helpfully long, a little over 11 feet, in two pieces with a power brick in the middle.<br /><br />The construction is solid.",

We had a slight problem with it syncing up to Adobe Flash, but Ugee customer service helped fix it right away, and everything works perfectly.

The G930 would constantly disconnect and reconnect and after normal daily use the mic would physically break at its weak point since half of the mic was made out of hard plastic and the other half soft bendable plastic, boy oh boy that was a huge mistake. The 2100 on the other hand didn't suffer from these connection problems or cheap mic construction, but the sound isolation wasn't as good as the G930's due to the ear cups being made out of cloth instead of leatherette. The 2100 was also less comfortable due to an unusually strong clamping force which never really lessened.<br /><br />I'm incredibly glad to say with the utmost joy that the SteelSeries H Wireless Headset doesn't share ANY of those faults and is the best headset I've ever owned by FAR. Not only is it exempt from those flaws, it outperforms in other areas as well. The sound quality is noticeably better, even only by a little, it is better than either previous headset. In addition, my favorite thing about this headset is the interchangeable battery! I NEVER have to go wired again...

One is a dust removal one and the other is the actual protector. But in reality, you can use the dust removal sheet as an actual protector also, so you're really getting two protector sheets. The thing i liked is that the intended protector sheet as a back peel and a front peel. I like this because i install the back peel on perfectly with no air bubbles. Then instead of peeling off the front one, i just left it on, then like in a couple months when it gets super dirty or something i'll just peel it off, and it'll be the actual protector that is on and be clean all over again. Then if something else goes wrong i'll use the dirt removal one. The protector is not too thin, not too thick, just right.  The only thing bad i have to say about this is that the screen protector is about like 1cm too small, so it doesn't cover the whole screen 100%, but i didn't really care because i think if it did, it would be harder to install because you need absolute perfection, so having that 1cm gives you room to breathe. So although it doesn't 100% of the screen 99% works just fine for me. Overall,i do think this was def worth the buy, but then again, i got mine for 20.00.

The weakest aspect of the device is the screen - it has a very narrow viewing \\\\\"sweet spot.\\\\\" I constantly fidget with the screen to find the right viewing angle. For comparison: my old HP DV9000 from 2007 had a much better viewing angle. Mind you, this isn't a deal breaker. As I said, it gets the job done. Although I'm glad I got it at a substantial discount on Black Friday 2012. I wouldn't pay full retail price, primarily because of the weak screen.  For this reason alone, I've deducted one star. Perhaps for a laptop under $1,000, I was expecting too much?<br />On the plus side, the computer features 2x USB 3.0 ports and 1x USB 2. Despite this, I really wish there were 4 total USB ports. My previous laptop had 4 and I used them all.  I'm not deducting any stars for this. I'm nitpicking.<br />There is a SD card reader, inconveniently placed anterior and underneath the device. In practice you'll likely have to lift the laptop up just to see the slot. Placing it on the side seems more practical. Again I'm not deducting a star, it's nitpicking<br />The computer is sufficiently fast although it's not a gaming laptop.<br />Upon first boot, you'll notice Windows 7 prompting you to burn your own backup disc. While not entirely necessary (a backup partition has this data), it's still a prudent thing to do. I realize ASUS is probably saving money, but I'd really like an official Windows 7 installation disc. You'll need 4 blank DVD's to accomplish the backup.<br />Overall I'm satisfied with this budget-grade laptop.

            "input": "This is my first tablet, so I wasn't really sure what size to get.  I went with the largest one I thought was affordable.  As it turns out, this was more than enough for my 22\\\\\" wide screen monitor(1680x1050 res).  It could easily handle two of my monitors(unless, you're a fan of using really large brush strokes).  When you consider the ability to zoom in and out on your work, it becomes obvious that you can get away with having a much smaller tablet.  Personally, I consider my brush strokes to be about average(though a bit heavy handed, apparently) and I probably only use about roughly 1/4th of my tablet surface at a time when drawing/painting due to zooming in and dragging the image around.  Anyone who's used a laptop touch pad can easily see how little space is needed to mouse around.  In other words, if you don't plan to do any real drawing or painting, you can get away with the smallest tablet you can find.  People who simply want to ditch their mouse can go with a Bamboo but anyone planning to do any type of photo editing or graphic work should stick to the Intuos(for the accuracy).  With all that said, I can easily shrink my tablet in the settings if I wanted to just use part of it instead of the whole thing.  However, I am getting used to taking advantage of the extra space.    It did take me a while to adjust to using the tablet.  I've been using a mouse and keyboard for over a decade.  I didn't really think about the fact I hadn't written or drawn much of anything with a real pen or pencil for so long would cause such a learning curve but it did.  However, I did adjust after about a week of use(I expected it to only take one or two afternoons since I normally adapt quickly).  I have to say, for drawing or working on photos, this is a lot easier.  I still prefer my mouse for everything else though.  This is partially because I can't fit both the tablet and my keyboard on the desk at the same time(I usually hold the tablet in my lap when I use it).    I don'tuse the Express Keys that much but after a little customizing and getting used to it, I'm finding them to be faster than relying on my keyboard.  I figure that with time I'll use my keyboard less and less.  I also spend less time clicking tool buttons and more efficiently spend my time just using express keys.  Being able to switch tools by simply pressing an Express Key really saves a lot of time.  Though, I wish I could find a way to resize the eraser without selecting it first.  From what I've seen of the previous generation Express Keys, I don't see all that much of an advantage to the new ones.  The improvement is nice but seemingly unnecessary.    My actual drawing skill is not that great, yet, so I don't get much use out of the pressure sensitivity.  Instead, I manually control the opacity.  I figure that as my skills develop, I will probably learn to take advantage of the pressure sensitivity.  I'm just not there yet.  That said, even if I'm not using the pressure sensitivity, it's still a lot easier to draw with the tablet than a mouse.  Since I've never tried the Intuos 3, I can't really compare the sensitivity.    I've noticed that the nibs seem to wear down fairly fast.  Also, I hear the surface sheets don't last very long either compared to the previous generation.  I don't know if this was intentional to increase sales of replacement parts or a sacrifice to gain something else.  It does make the Intuos 3 seem more desirable in that sense.    Probably my biggest complaint with the whole thing is the pen itself.  It's just too fat for me.  It makes me feel like I'm using one of those fat pencils from Kindergarten.  I've more or less adjusted to it but I'll probably end up buying that slimmer version that doesn't have the rubber grip.    Ultimately, if I had it to do all over again, I'm not sure whether I'd get a smaller tablet.  I could very easily be happier with a smaller tablet, if for no other reason than being able to fit it on my desk.  However, the extra tablet space makes a dual monitor setup more comfortable.  I normally find the extra screen space unnecessary but when drawing/painting, there's a certain amount of advantage to being able to focus one monitor on just the painting and put everything else aside to the other monitor.  I could have saved money by getting an Intuos 3 but Wacom doesn't really seem to be supporting them anymore.  The advantages of the Intuos 4 over the Intuos 3 just don't seem necessary, this is especially true in the case of someone, like me, who doesn't take full advantage of the pressure sensitivity.",

The G13 gameboard also offers pre-configured settings for many popular games, including World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade, Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and many others.&#34;<br /><br />Nowhere does it say that you need the LGS software to run any of the profiles. It only mentions it when describing how to program your keys.<br /><br />I do have to admit though, everything else on the keypad works flawlessly. The software is very useful and the hardware is up to logitech standards. I just can't believe they advertised this as a portable keypad when you need to install the Logitech Gaming Software to even run it. The worst part is that there are other logitech products such as the G series gaming mice that DO have the ability to use the set profiles without a driver.

Very frustrating, and the wife was not too happy with the situation either.  I was absolutely shocked at how easy it was to set up the Ceton InfiniTV4.  A few things:<br /><br />First - I have Comcast, dont let them charge you to swap out your current equipment, or have a tech come out to do a \\\\\"professional\\\\\" install.  Go to the store PHYSICALLY and get your cable card.  This saves you 50 bucks.<br />Second - MAKE SURE, you upgrade the devices drivers AND FIRMWARE before trying to configure it.  I didn't update the firmware and couldn't get the card to work until I did so.<br />Third - There may be some signal quality issues that weren't previously noticeable with your old receiver box.  In my case the comcast tech had to run a whole new length of cable from my house to the node.<br /><br />After all that - this card is everything I hoped and dreamed my HTPC would be initially.  I also have an xbox that is set up as a media center extender, and I can stream live or recorded TV to that as well (ie. can watch two different channels at the same time on both my HTPC and Xbox).<br /><br />The only issue I've had is that occasionally I get the message \\\\\"No tuners available\\\\\" or \\\\\"All tuners in use\\\\\" in WMC when trying to stream TV.

This means (a) you will not be able to pull the drive caddy out, and (b) there's nothing stopping it from falling out if you give the laptop a good jolt while it was vertical. I solved this problem by dismounting the push-to-eject handle from the DVD unit and attaching it to the new caddy. This has a locking mechanism in it to keep the hard drive locked in and allows me to pull it out. It also leaves the DVD with a small gap that I can grab with my finger to pull the drive out.

The materials are good, and the build quality appears to be a notch about many of the cheap products I've seen.<br /><br />The problem is, it just doesn't fit right. The case appears to be just ever so slightly too narrow. With the iPad fully inserted, the far left edge hangs a bit off the edge into the spine. This causes the top cover not to line up properly. This in turn causes problems with the clips on the cop and bottom of the case that are meant to clip onto the iPad and hold the cover in place. The bottom clip will snap in eastily, but the top clip absolutely will not snap into place unless you forcibly bend and contort it into place.<br /><br />I've contacted Marware support about the issue, and hope to hear back soon. I'll update when I do, but, for now, I would avoid this case if you have a 4th generation iPad.<br /><br />Update 12/12/12: I did get a response from Marware. They claimed that my issue wasn't a known problem, but agreed to send out a new cover.<br /><br />In the interim, I noticed that my existing cover was beginning to loosen up a bit. After a few days, the pressure needed to close the case had diminished greatly. I did finally receive the replacement, and it does seem to fit marginally better than my original did out of the box. Unfortunately, the replacement has other build issues that the first did not. The replacement has a great deal of extra material sticking out around the stitching. It makes the cover feel very poorly built. In the end I decided to keep my original cover. The stitching on it is much cleaner, and it has loosened up enough that I don't have issues opening and closing it now as I did initially.<br /><br />I will say that I do like the case. It is light, looks good,  and provides very good protection. It's unfortunate that build quality does seem to be a bit of an issue. I'm raising my initial 2 star review to a 3 star, which is probably more like 3.5 stars. The truth is, even with the Marware case's flaws, I've not found an iPad case that I like any better.",

I'm using it exclusively as an HTPC, hooked up to a Pioneer A/V receiver and an old 60\\\\\" LG plasma TV. It plays all audio and video files I tried (of course, this depends on the software used). 4K videos works well on my monitor but the TV can't handle it reliably (TV is not 4K). Noise is a non-issue. The VESA mount works well for hiding it behind the monitor/TV. From my router in the living room at the rear of the house to my home office at the front is 55 feet and I'm getting 5-bar WIFI signal strength. If your expectation is realistic, it should work well for you. It's a good HTPC or secondary desktop PC.<br /><br />One serious Issue:<br /><br />At first I could not update to Windows 8.1. It got stuck on downloading loops with each loop lasted about one hour, then it started over without actually downloading anything. I tried several times on different days with the same result, so I decided to forget about it. Then a week later it updated to Windows 8.1 automatically.  However, after the update LAN ports and WLAN were dead. Lenovo tech support did not help at all. Since Windows troubleshooting indicated it was having problems with the drivers, I went to Lenovo web site and downloaded the Windows 8.1 LAN and WLAN driver files and installed. Still didn't work. I decided to start clean and uninstalled the drivers, downloaded the Windows 8.0 files and installed. To my delight, LAN and WIFI worked with 8.0 driver files. Out of curiosity, I installed 8.1 files again. And yes LAN and WIFI were dead again!  Finally, I uninstalled and reinstalled 8.0 files and left it at that. Bottom line: DO NOT use the Windows 8.1 driver files; you need the 8.0 files.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />I don't like or care for included funky remote. I'm using the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800 and mouse combo, which works very well from a distance of 12 feet. It still works at 14 feet but becomes a little jumpy.<br /><br />It becomes warm to the touch after running for a while. Exhaust feels hot but it's nothing to be alarmed.

Yes, it nearly doubles the weight of the kindle package, but that's still pretty light. For ease of using the Kindle while in the case it's excellent.  All the controls are quite reachable and audio books are still quite audible, though perhaps the sound is a little blurred.  I haven't tested the splashproofness, but I think I'd be confident to read in the bath with the KlearKase on.<br /><br />My gripes with it are all small things.  The biggest would be that it's far more reflective than the kindle screen.  Considering the non-reflectivity is a major advantage of the kindle, this is the big thing that makes me less inclined to keep the kindle in the KlearKase all the time.  That said, it's see-through enough that it doesn't detract from visibility any more than reading a book through a glass window does.  The other three small disadvantages are a) I think the surface might scratch quite easily, eventually resulting in a less clear viewing, b) you need a quarter (or a 10c piece if you're Australian) to be able to open the case and take the kindle out, which can be a bit tedious, and c) the silicone sections pick up dust and hairs really easily, which means I had to put in-take out-put in-take out-put in just to get the inner side of the silicone parts hair-free (I have a fluffy cat at home).<br /><br />Overall, it's like Mary Poppins - \\\\\"practically perfect in every way\\\\\" :-)",

Because it was intended to match the right hand (second) monitor it needed to be 20\\\\\" and due to the Ergotron mount, it needed to be light.<br /><br />Before purchasing this monitor, please note that there are no VESA mounts on the back. You must use the stand that comes with it and that stand elevates the screen just under three inches. This is going to be a very important consideration for a lot of people.<br /><br />As a monitor, the unit performs as expected. Color reproduction runs a little heavy into the blue spectrum and will need to be calibrated if you are a graphic designer... wait hang on. Why are you looking at a 20\\\\\" screen, designer? Moving on. The back light isn't especially bright and the menu has four default settings (movie, photo, gaming, text) in addition to \\\\\"custom\\\\\". After a couple of hours, I'm finding the monitor a bit hard to look at due to the fact the anti-aliasing on fonts looks terrible. At this point, I've further reduced the brightness to level 25/100 to deal with it.<br /><br />Finally, the power cable is non-standard. If your power conversion box goes, you'll have to buy a new one. While it's not likely to happen, it does represent an extra part to lose or break. On the other hand, if you haven't lost or broken the charger attachment for your phone, printer, tablet, or... well you get the idea. People who take good care of their things will probably be fine. People who don't may not want the extra part attached.<br /><br />In short, the monitor that came with this Gateway vastly out-performs the HP monitor that arrived at the office this morning.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Price is right<br />+ Slim, light,<br />+ Shiny finish, modern looking case<br />+ Energy efficient<br /><br />Cons:<br />+ Limited brightness & color adjustment<br />+ No mounting bracket<br />+ Very short non-adjustable stand<br />+ Non-standard power input<br />+ Shiny surface will scratch easily<br />+ Not as bright as expected from an LED screen<br />+ Gamma is heavily blue, even in warm light mode (cheap LED backlight)<br />+ Poor anti-aliasing, especially on fonts.

Unfortunately, many of the changes made in design aren't necessarily better, just different.    The increase in screen resolution is a very welcome change.  Simple diagrams that were illegible on the K1 are just fine on the K2.  As I'm finding though, progress on the Kindles does not come without some negative, in this case the screen contrast on the K2 seems a little lower then on the K1.  Also, I think they got that page turning speed up by hobbling the screen refresh: when taking the K2 out of sleep, ghosting from whatever picture was on the splash is clearly visible and doesn't go away until doing an <alt-g>.    The buttons.  We've all heard more then we care to about the buttons.  Again, I have to go back to the two steps forward one step back kindle design.  Yes, the big, easy press buttons on the K1 could be a pain and the inward pressing buttons were a great solution to the perceived problem.  Unfortunately, they went too far by making the edge buttons so much smaller.  Long reading sessions can now become uncomfortable for those with large hands as you tend to place your thumb either right on or next to the next page button (basically, holding the Kindle by its very edge).  This certainly cramps my thumb up.    The memory and battery changes are a mixed bag I guess; I'm not a fan of the changes but certainly don't consider them deal breakers, either.  The first charge on my K2 was no better than the K1 though that seems to have improved with use.    One last point that's more a publisher gripe then Amazon gripe is the tendency to offer ebooks based on trade paperbacks, pricing them at $9.99 and still claiming a discount.  If a book's been out for a few years, there's no reason for the ebook to cost $9.99.  Reevaluating that policy would be good for everyone involved.    Overall I'd call the K2 a good purchase but as an upgrade to the K1, not so much.  If you think aK2's right for you, it probably is.  Whispernet alone puts the Kindle beyond all other readers (if you're in a coverage area).",

I downloaded over 100 free out-of-copy-write titles the day I got my Kindle - amazing works of literature for free! My only complaint is that more titles aren't available as Kindle editions, but I feel this is more a sign of the times and not any reflection on Amazon - I suspect Nook and other comparable e-readers have similar availability limitations. The Amazon site allows you to request publishers make certain titles available on Kindle, so they obviously recognize this limitation on the e-reader market. Hopefully most publishers will soon embrace the future. I know I for one have repurchased several titles I already owned just to have them on Kindle where I can have quick and easy access to them, so I'm confident the future will be rich with e-books!",

Regardless of how it works, I still enjoy using it, playing games on it, and am planning on replacing this for my phone since there are apps you can download to use it exactly as a phone.<br /><br />On the same day I received it, I decided to order two more for my sisters' birthday (black A13 and Blue A13 Dragon touch). It got to my house two days later, but when I was trying to charge them, the slots were too loose or too small and the charger would not even go in. I thought it was the charger's fault but then I tried it on my white tablet and the chargers worked fine. I am in the process of returning them and getting a refund because 200 dollars for two broken tablets did not make me happy.<br /><br />After this incident, I PROBABLY won't order any more of these tablets because I will probably have the same problem again. But I do think it's worth the price if your tablet gets to your house and works and do recommend it to people who does not want to pay for an iPad or other expensive tablets. What I don't understand though, is why was the first one I ordered working but not the two that came after? Like everyone says, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________<br />UPDATE-<br /><br />I sucked up and decided to order another one. This time, the tablet came messed up again, but I kept it because even though the charger slot was too small, all I needed to do was plug in the keyboard cord and the holes were evened out. The tablets still works the same, kind of slow, freezes often, and used up all the 6gb that were available since the tablet came with installed apps. The battery life is horrible, lasts me 30 mins - 1 hour since I use the tablet often. -You get what you pay for.<br /><br />After two months, the laptop screens cracked, and when they cracked, they broke like taped plastic.

The main issue with setting up the VPN was finding a protocol that both the router and the SnapGear had in common.  The EnGenius router has several different protocols to choose from and not being a true network guru it took a few minutes to go through them.    On the local network I have a consistent 1 Gbps connection.  There is no lag when streaming from my computer to my PS3 or XBOX.  I also stream straight from the internet and have never had a problem.  I also learned that you need all 8 wires to get 1 Gbps.  I had split my cat 5 into 2 connections using 4 wires each and could not get 1 Gbps connections.  Once I \\\\\"unsplit\\\\\" the connection it worked like a charm.  I was using a Linksys VPN router before and if I had the log file option turned on it would crash when hitting web sites like Amazon (google Amazon crash Linksys) and Fandango.  This router has no issue when any websites that I have found.    The wireless does work well.  I have the router in the basement and had an 80% signal when upstairs and 50-60 feet away.    I really only have had one issue with the router and that is the DNS relay.  After a reboot of the router I was not able to access the internet.  DHCP was assigning the router's IP as my DNS server but it was not working.  I set the router to assign a DNS server from my ISP and everything worked again.  The interface is different from other routers as well and takes a minute to find what you are looking for.  Also, when assigning a static IP via DHCP there is not a comment section only a MAC and IP field.  This isn't a big deal but it would be nice to have a comment field saying 00:00:00:00:00 192.168.1.50 Office, or something to that affect.  These are minor issues and nothing that I care greatly about.    Overall I do love this router it is exponentially better than routers that cost 2 or 3times as much.  Being an unknown brand, at least to me, I was a little concerned.  It has proven to be a great router and I'm very happy with it.  I would recommend this router for anyone needing a VPN router.",

Before I got the kindle I swore I would never get one because I saw it as an assault on my much loved paper books. The portability of this thing, the e-ink and the instant access to free books (more on that in a minute) really won me over though. Reading text on a regular screen makes my eyes tired and I usually just don't prefer to do it, but reading the kindle feels just like reading words on paper. And being able to carry the contents of huge books with me without the bulk of an actual book which may be 100's of pages long means I can find time to do a lot more reading.   That all being said, my kindle contains mostly free downloads and just a few books that were on the cheaper side. I'm not super fond of the idea that I could purchase an e-book (which sometimes is more expensive than an actual paper book) and then I'm limited with what I can do with it.  When I'm done with the book, why can't I give my digital copy away to someone else? If I can sell or give away my regular books why shouldn't I be able to do the same with my e-books? Just like if I can lend regular books to my friends and let them keep them for more than two weeks, why can we only lend out kindle books for two weeks? Some people are busy and two weeks isn't enough time.  Reading free books though has let me find some really good new authors who self-published. And being able to download books whenever I want is convenient for those instances where I find myself with some free time but the library isn't open, or just enough time that I'd like to read something but not enough time to get to the library even if it is open. I took my Kindle with me when I went on vacation to Europe and was able to use WiFi at the hostel to download the next book in a series so that I'd have something to read on a train ride. And again, being that the Kindle is so small bringing it with me on a trip whereI only had one small carry on sized suitcase and a backpack (for a two week trip) was not a problem.",

Being a voracious - some may say obsessive! - reader since I was just a young tot, I got used to making room for yet another bookcase as my collection continued to grow.  I'd been eying the Kindle and other ebook readers as they've entered the market over the last few years but held off on buying one; I wasn't sure that the reading experience could be comparable.    That all changed several months ago when I saw someone reading a Kindle at a restaurant.  She gladly gave me a brief 'demo,' and once I spent a couple minutes trying it out I knew that I'd sure like to have one of my own.  Come Christmas morning - there it was.  My very own Kindle!    It was simple to get started from zero, so to speak.  Within a few minutes I'd downloaded a book I'd been wanting to read, and very quickly I added a number of 'classics' and other public domain books.  My Kindle's been within arm's reach ever since.    The long battery life has been the biggest surprise; even with heavy use I've only had to charge it once so far.  Another surprise came as I read and read and read - the eInk screen has been much easier on my eyes than a paper book.  I'm not as young as I used to be, and in recent years I've been distressed to find myself with eyestrain after a couple hours of reading a paper book.  That just isn't happening on the Kindle and I couldn't be happier about it!      I'll never give up my paper books.  Some books just won't 'translate' quite as well to the Kindle - my cookbooks, for example, with their full color photos, are definitely paper book only material.  The Kindle renders black & white photos quite well, but I wouldn't want to use it to read/view any book that's richly illustrated.    For my everyday reading habits, however, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Kindle.",

In any case, I must say that this new My Book Elite is my new favorite of the hard drives at least.  Much like others like it, it is a separate memory bank from your computer or laptop so that should your pc fry, you can still have your files safely tucked away.<br /><br />As some of you know, your external hard drive can also fry, so it's good to have a backup of the backup (hence I have 4 laying about) but they're still very handy.  Unlike others, however, the My Book does a few other nifty things its competition can't.  For example, it comes with software that easily backs up your computer files without your having to hunt for you and even categorizes them by type (Pictures, music, movies, etc).  It also allows password protection which makes my privacy needs happy, and has a view screen that lets you know how much memory is remaining and a title if you wish.  For example, if you had 6 of these guys you could name one \\\\\"Home Videos - 2001\\\\\" or something so you don't have to put masking tape on it or something as a label.  It also comes with a 3 year warranty which is much more than my other hard drives.<br /><br />Overall - External Hard Drives are kind of tricky.  They all run the risk of breaking and they all typically do the same thing.  I was more impressed with the My Book than others because of its extra goodies and extended warranty, but it also came in a cheaper container - plastic, instead of some which are rock-hard metal.  It's a little more expensive, too, but it also runs absolutely silent whereas some of the others are about as annoying as a snoring spouse.  Personally, as long as you don't expect the guy to undergo some kind of mega damage that might crack it's plastic coat, I think it's worth the few extra bucks to have the software and extra warranty.<br /><br />PS: If you are simply wondering whether or not you need an external hard drive - YOU DO.  With laptops that burn out all the time, you need a safer spot to store your precious memories and files.  I recommend this one more than any other, but if you don't like the look or whatever, still buy an external hard drive.  They make your computer run so much faster and makes everything so much cleaner and nicer.  They're like super massive usb drives!ve - YOU DO.

One draw back<br />is that there is no backup software. You will have to drag and drop all your files initially<br />and subsequently whenever you update any of those files. Nothing is automatic.<br /><br />In the box is the hard drive, a USB 2.0 cable, a AC adapter power cable and set-up<br />instructions. This drive is designed to turn on and off with your computer as well.<br />Set-up is very simple with plug-and-play technology: plug in to power strip, plug the<br />USB cable into a receptacle on your computer. Your computer will recognize your external<br />hard drive and assign it a letter. You are all set to drag and drop your precious files.<br /><br />I have had this model for three years and If I had my druthers I would have spent the<br />extra money and gotten the WD hard drive with the automatic backup software. I<br />purchased one for a friend and set it up and it works like a dream. The only time it<br />took was to initialize the first backup onto the hard drive. After that it only adds what<br />it needs to do update the backup. Simple.<br /><br />Some people would say, why not use the backup software that comes with your Windows 7<br />operating system. I did. I don't like it. It was not as simple to set up and maintain as the<br />WD HD; and not as efficient.  Why? Because every time my Windows 7 backup program<br />backs up, it back up the whole computer hard drive, again. It is much simpler to buy<br />the external hard drive with the dedicated backup software.<br /><br />After 3 years I have had absolutely no problems with this passive Western Digital hard<br />drive. So I can absolutely recommend buying it, but with one caveat; get the model with<br />the back up software. Your life will be easier and more secure with auto back up.

I was very familiar with many of the common problems people deal with when setting up a blu-ray for their machine, but I felt that my technical skills would help me surpass these issues. I knew that the firmware would need to be updated and that window did not support blu-ray playback and thus I would have to use a 3rd party software to actually watch blu-rays. After reading a few of the other reviews I saw that this unit came with software and I figured that although I am not a fan of cyberlink software, I could deal with it if it would work. As it turns out my specific set-up does not work with the provided Cyberlink software and like many other reviewers I would need to purchase the latest Cyberlink DVD 12 software for eighty bucks. To hell with that i said and decided to do some research on freeware that would allow one to view blu-rays without having to pay for the software. After exhaustive research I was able to configure my computer with the aid of 4 different software 1 to enable to codec, 1 to play it, 1 to remove copy protection, and 1 to configure all of the micro settings between the various programs. When all is said and done the blu-ray's play but will skip and sometimes audio/video will de-sync. Now considering the number of solutions required to get the blu-ray to play its difficult to say if the problem is software or Hardware(my machine was top of the line 4 years ago so it might not be powerful enough to decode a 1080p image properly).<br /><br />To sum it up, the drive appears to be excellent.

Gave up my Windows laptop for this Chromebook.  I love it.  It is light, typing is great, normal... no issues with keyboard.  Feels high quality to me.  I don't quite like the exterior but I don't see it when I am working on the laptop.  My daughter thought that I had bought a Mac Book Air.   The screen is beautiful.  I guess the 1080 doesn't scale so there is tiny tiny font.  Was an adjustment after the BIG BEAUTIFUL screen on my Chromebase, but I am getting used to it.  I have read there are ways to increase the font but I haven't figured all of that out; it's legible though. I am good for now especially just zooming in.  Processing speed seems fine to me. I do everything on the net... banking, remote desktop to my work computer, email, you tube, etc. I am not a power user, so I never stream 10 things with 20 tabs open.  I might have 5 tabs max and maybe music, but rarely.  Works perfectly fine for my use.   Sound is nice.  Sounds better than the big LG Chromebase (but I still love the Chromebase.)  Has all the necessary ports.  Also it is LIGHT. My goodness.  My hubby just a bought an Windows 8 laptop that is beautiful (but heavy), but boy I can log on soooo much faster.  He hates when his laptop powers all the down.  This thing is quick!   Oh, it does get warm.  Not as bad as my old Windows Thinkpad, but it is certainly noticeable on my lap when I am wearing shorts. The warmth and the tiny font are why I am giving this 4 stars. It's not perfect.  But, it is good enough... certainly for the price!  My hubby's Windows 8 laptop cost more than 2x as much.  10/14/15 UPDATE.  Had this a year now.  Was great.  Loved it. But NO LONGER!!!!  Hate it.  The screen stopped working.  It see gray lines when I open it up.  Lasts for about 5 minutes, then it slowly fades to normal. I moved the few things off the hard drive that I had there incase I totally lose the screen which I expect to happen at any moment.  Also,  occasionally, the colors start to change, bright pink, fuzzy, shadows, etc.  It's annoying and weird.  I am currently searching for a new chrome laptop.  I see other reviews here with screen problems, so be careful.  I bought mine right after they came out so I could not have known about the screen issue.  Now YOU know. DO NOT BUY IT.  Getting only one year of use out of it is unacceptable.",

The back cover many pick up some lint depending on where it's placed but that's easily remedied with a quick swipe of a damp cloth. Overall a great inexpensive option. I had the red and white Paris cover for my previous ipad gen 3 and loved it as well. I can't speak to how well it protects the iPad from a fall as it's never fallen, but it's a good sturdy cover that completely covers the ipad and all corners and closes securely with the magnets.

I will say, much like the Asus internal Wireless AC adapter I have on another computer, it's important to use the antenna extender if you want full speed.  If you move the adapter around a little, the speed can change significantly.  However, I should also say that when the adapter is plugged directly into the computer (as you might do on a laptop) it's still getting a least 300 mbs - and since my fastest Comcast speed is 55 mbs, that's more than enough for surfing the web or downloading video.<br /><br />I use apple TV (I have 5) to stream from a server, and I can use this adapter to turn my iTunes (on this computer) into an apple TV.<br /><br />Very pleased.

I just now ordered an 8GB unit because it's only $19.97 with prime shipping - cheaper than the 4GB right now which is still at $39.99 - go figure.  MAIN SELLING POINT:  If this drive were to drop out of your pocket or purse, etc. onto the sidewalk (scenarios), or be burglarized from your house, the finder/stealer cannot see your data even though he/she has physical possession of the drive.  They could reformat the drive and use it for other purposes but they would NOT get access to your data.  After 10 failed login attempts the drive is programmed to lock out any access attempts and MUST be reformatted.  (Kingston has a built-in process that forces you to choose a decently complex password so bad guy is never going to guess your password in 10 tries.)  These have worked for me on both Windows 7 and the dreaded Windows Vista (I got rid of my one Vista PC about 6 months ago).  I now have Windows 7 on all PCs.  I have turned off autorun for security reasons.  Instead, I trudge down through Windows Explorer to find the DTPrivacy launcher file on the drive in the file tree.  It works, it's just some extra effort that's all.  I only dock this drive when I need to.  If it's not plugged in, it's less likely to be hacked.  Common sense.  Some people ( a few) might run into issues with the E: drive being blocked or in use because Explorer shows the E: drive letter is taken up by the CD/DVD optical drive (which is common).  It is not hard to get around this.  Either try taking the disk out of the Optical drive unit or you could go to Computer, Manager, Disk Management (IF you know what you're doing, be careful here) and reassign the drive letter of the Optical drive to a &#34;higher&#34; letter to remove the conflict.  ADDENDUM / OBSERVATIONS: I find that while doing a file save of CHANGES to a 28Megabyte using Microsoft Word to the Kingston drive of a particular .RTF file with a lot of mixed tables, graphics, custom text formatting can be dog slow (like 45 seconds to 1 minute) .  The hourglass for that save process takes over the entire computer.  Fortunately, I don't have to save that file very often.  I'm just used to it.  Yes I have tons of space  remaining (over a Gigabyte or more) on my Kingston drive and hard drives - that's not what's causing this.  I'm not worried about it.  I figure it's encryption processing that is parsing the entire content of the file for changes.  Just a guess.  My Text file and PDF file saves go quickly.  Years ago, in the early XP days, I did own an earlier 1GB gray colored predecessor of this drive which - it was eventually discovered - had a security flaw intrinsic to the firmware of that particular earlier series.  Kingston was aware of the flaw and discontinued that series long ago.  Back then these were like (trying to remember) $80 dollars(?) for 1GB.  I have deliberately passed on Windows version 8.X up till now so can't speak to usability.  I wasn't up for the aggravation although I'm told it runs faster.  Microsoft has recently announced (April 2014) that they will finally &#34;fix&#34; Windows 8.1 usability issues in two separate passes.  When they will drop the shoe on part 2 of the fix, I don't know.  I just know it's been announced.  In the meantime, I'm happy with Windows 7.  While I would be disappointed if my current blue DataTraveler drives didn't work in the revised Windows 8.X (or even future Windows 9), it wouldn't break my heart.  To have simple, reliable, off-line, self-contained security ( I leave one of these at work in case my home had a catastrophe) is a small price to pay for the peace of mind these relatively cheap backups bring.  If worst comes to worst I'll purchase the new iteration and be out max $80 - $100 for 4 drives that work with the latest greatest.  I doubt if it will come to that but if it does, no big deal.  ____________________________  UPDATE  Jan 2016  - none of these have ever failed me.   They also work fine with Windows 10 - no hassles or needed updates.  Can still recommend highly.",

Cons:  * it's big big big big big.  Because it takes up three expansion slots, if you are using two of these together, you need a really big motherboard that can fit them both properly and get them into the right slots.  Know your case.  Know your motherboard.  * it's long long long long long - In my Antec 1200 case (a large, 12-bay case) I can't fit a standard 3.5&#34; HDD (non-solid-state drive) in front of the card (in a straight line with the card basically) and still use the Antec HDD cage with the built-in fan.  Just make SURE you have the space in your case, and room for the expansion slots on your motherboard, before you buy this card!!!  Measure!  It is long!  Details: The Antec 1200 comes with three, 3-drive cages, and then three empty slots for DVD drives.  Because there is a fan in front of the drives, the drives are moved closer to the video card than they would be if there was no fan.  So, I moved my DVD drive down from the top bay so that it is in-line with the card (since it is not as deep as a HDD), and moved the middle HDD cage to the top.  A bit of wiring to move around, but not the end of the world.  * Kind of expensive relative to the 4GB version of the GTX 670.  The 670 4GB (the one made by Gigabyte) is the same size, and has the same awesome three-fan cooling setup, but costs a lot less.  If you are OK with slightly lower performance of the 670 spec vs 680 spec, the 670 is a LOT better value.  2015 UPDATE: Retiring this card after years of faithful service, upgrading to a Gigabyte GTX 980 TI of similar design.  The three-fan setup rules them all.  Still highly recommended if you find one used.  Great card.",

It seems to be good protection for the Paperwhite when carried in something like a laptop bag, which is my primary consideration.  I also believe it will provide adequate protection against dropping (although I hope not to find out).  When reading, it's a very comfortable size, and best of all, the cover folds all the way back very easily - it's not stiff, and you don't feel like you're damaging the cover by folding it all the way back to read.<br /><br />I bought the Amazon leather cover for my Kindle Keyboard, but preferred to use a Timbuk2 sleeve instead.  The cover for the KK was bigger than I liked, and difficult to fold back when reading.  I preferred to read without a cover on the KK, but the Paperwhite is enough smaller that reading with the cover is actually more comfortable than reading without it.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about the price of this cover, particularly when thinking I'd want a sleeve as well. Now that I've tried this one, it'll be the only cover I need.  Still, it seems to me that it should be $10 cheaper.",

You also get true digital quality and a noise-canceling technology to filter out unwanted background noise and deliver better voice recognition, better voice command, better voice recording, and more. Sleek, compact, and attractive, the itself is black, but on the pictures it looked like a very dark grey, and the base itself sliver. Nice...but I wished it would of been a all black color! Its also not built cheaply either, it is perfect for any desktop. This has got to be the best microphone I've ever owned. I'm thinging about getting my mom and younger brother one too! Note: You have be like a half foot away from the microphone, or you'll get distorted speech. For very cheap people this microphone isn't for you, because it cost almost 20 bucks! But I'm telling you it's worth it! Their is a 3.5mm version for 9.99 with 4.99 sh, links are below.   [...]    Pros:  Advanced digital USB provides superior clarity, The simplicity of a single plug-and-play connection, Noise-canceling microphone filters out unwanted background noise, Power switch illuminates when microphone is active, Microphone pivots on weighted, stable base to hold preferred position, 8 ft shielded cord with USB connector, offers convenience and flexibility around your desktop, Mute switch on base for easy control, Weighted base for stability.

            "input": "These are a great set of derive enclosures. Please be careful when reading the reviews since the product page allows you to choose from 5 different models. And those models may change over time. Yet all the same reviews show for all the models with the same value for the &#34;This review is from&#34; line above the review. Also, I've noticed that some of the specifications people are stating in their reviews completely contradict the information in the product description and from the manufacturers website. This is likely due to newer models coming out since they did their review. For example, at the time I am wiring this, the most useful review states as a con that it &#34;doesn't fit drives with &#62; 9.5mm height&#34;. Well... that's only true for the models that specific say &#34;fits drive up 9.5mm&#34; or &#34;fits drive up to 7mm&#34;. It's certainly not true for the model that &#34;fits drives up to 12.5mm&#34;. So that review is for a very specific review. The same review also lists a lack of SATA-III (6GB) as a con. Yet when I went to the manufacture's site, all the drives list SATA I, II, and III support. That review is a year old at this time, so SATA III support may have been added (and the model number may or may not have changed) since that person wrote the review.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that potential buyers rely on the product specifications from the description and from the manufacturers website rather than those in the reviews to ensure accurate and up to date information. After you chose the size and interface options, scroll down to the Product Details and take a look at the Item model number and then visit the manufacture's website (the address is in their name) to get up to date product specifications. At the time of this review (Sept 2014) the following options are available:<br />USB 3.0 With UASP<br />up to 7mm  S2510BPU337  Amazon ASIN:  B00JQJURMM<br />up to 9.5mm  S2510BMU33  Amazon ASIN:  B00E1JAB3M<br />up to 12.5mm  S2510SM12U33  Amazon ASIN:  B00GYR75GK<br />USB 3.0<br />up to 9.5mm  SAT2510BU32  Amazon ASIN:  B007019HJW<br />up to 12.5mm  SAT2510B12U3  Amazon ASIN:  B005G2JFFI<br /><br />I personally purchased the model S2510SM12U33 - 12.5mm USB 3.0 With UASP.  My review will focus on that enclosure, but I will also talk about all the enclosures in general. I'll be sure to highlight when talking about a feature specific to the model I purchased.<br /><br />When choosing one of these enclosures, the first choice is whether to get one of the USB 3.0 or the USB3.0 with UASP enclosures. In general, I'd recommend people purchase one of the the UASP (USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Protocol). Even if your control USB 3.0 does not have UASP support or your OS does not support it, the enclosure will still work as a standard USB 3.0 enclosure (which is backwards compatible with USB 2 but at a reduced speed.) But you will have a more future proof enclosure for when you do get a UASP compatible system (or use if you use the portable drive with one &#34;out on the road&#34;). UASP can provide a significant improvement in read/write speeds while reducing CPU utilization. And it does not add much to the cost of the enclosure.<br /><br />The next choice is maximum height of the drive. However, I personally recommend you look at the other features between the differnt enclosures since the difference is not merely in the maximum drive height. For example, the 12.5mm w/UASP (S2510SM12U33) that I bought is an all aluminum enclosure that uses the ASMedia 1053E chipset  where as the 9.5mm w/UASP (S2510BMU33) is an Aluminum & Plastic enclosure that uses the ASMedia 1053 (rather than the 1053E) chipset. And the smallest of the three, the 7mm w/UASP (S2510BPU337) is an all plastic case (also with the ASMedia 1053 chipset).<br /><br />The smaller 7m (S2510BPU337) is also a tool-less installation design. While some might consider that a plus, I see it as a negative. The reason being is the tool-less design relies on afoam pad to be attached to the end of the drive with sticky tape for installation. This limits the ability to swap drives out in the future. Also I just like the security that my hard drive is security attached in the case. I do not consider having to tighten 6 to 8 small screws a major hassle. It literally took me 3 minutes to install my drive and assembly the case.  Thus, I do not think it is worth sacrificing security, durability, and (long term) re-usability in order to save a minute or two in installation.<br /><br />Another factor to look at is the placement of the led power and activity light. For example, on the 9.5mm w/UASP (S2510BMU33) drive, the LED is on the same end that the cable attaches. This assumes you are using a USB port on the front of your PC and thus both the cable port and the LED will point towards you when you place the enclosure on the top of your PC. However, if like me, you use a cable attached to the rear of your PC, this would make seeing the LED difficult. Granted you do not need to look at it often. But when you do, it's nice to be able to just glance at it. For the 12.5mm w/UASP (S2510SM12U33) model that I purchased, it is on the top of the case.<br /><br />Here's how I selected the model I ended up getting: I knew I wanted UASP support, so that left me with 3 of the 5 options. I ruled out the 7mm since it was tool-less installation for the reasons I described above. Plus, why limit to such a small drive. An extra 9mm in overall enclosure height is not a big deal. I liked that the 12.5mm was all aluminum, that it had the LED on top, that it used the slightly better 1053E chipset, it gave me the space to hold a 12.5 mm drive if I ever needed to, and as a bonus, it has an external DC power connector. All of these enclosures will get enough power via the USB 3 channel. But having the power connector is a nice &#34;just in case&#34; bonus. (Sometimes you get a system that either does not deliver the power is should over the USB bus, orits over taxed with a million things plugged into it.)<br /><br />I've used a number of different drive enclosures over the years. (I carry a portable drive between home and work.) This is my first StarTech enclosure. But I've used a number of StarTech add-on cards (and cables) over the years and have always been happy with their products. When looking for a USB 3.0 enclosure, I decided I wanted to get one with UASP. Many of the other USB 3.0 enclosures out there by other manufacturers  do not have the UASP support. And I also wanted one of decent quality. There are a lot of portable drive enclosures out there. You'll see many are aimed at the magic ten, fifteen or twenty dollar price points. But to hit that, something has to give. I've always found the good 2.5&#34; portable enclosures are in the twenty-five to thirty-five dollar range. These enclosures hit that tier and are of nice quality. I am very happy with the build quality and performance of the enclosure I got.<br /><br />I used mine to hold a brand new 1TB Samsung 850 Pro SSD drive. It fit in to the case without any hassles. (As I said, total install was under 3 minutes). Everything worked fine the first time I connected it, and has every time since. Overall, you can't go wrong with one of these StarTech enclosures, especially the 12.5 mm w/UASP (S2510SM12U33) model.",

I think the only problem with it is Windows XP, which doesn't include Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc. I've used it as a DVD player and I've attempted to burn a CD with it too.<br />It has a built in wireless card, so access to the internet at home and at my middle school is very easy and without cables. The large 60GB hard drive is wonderful to have and the multiple USB ports are helpful. The mouse pad can be turned on and off and it also has a scroll bar on the mouse pad. I haven't had any problems with the amount of sound it makes, for it only is loud on the first few seconds of start up. It also stays fairly cool for it has quite a few vents on it.<br />There are a few problems though. This is a thicker computer then most new ones, which is because it has a Floppy Disk drive, which most newer laptops don't have. Also, it is quite heavy, heavier then my older 1212CL model. I also very much dislike Windows XP. I even set my laptop's toolbar and such back to the basic windows style. I'd much rather have Windows ME, like my other computer.<br />Overall this is a great computer for a decent price. I recommend getting an extended warrenty on it though.

I did very thorough research for an iPad stand before making a purchase. (It seems many people have purchased several different stands because they end up being poor quality, not what they thought it was and or it breaks. I literally read hundreds of reviews about dozens of stands and decided on this one because of the great reviews.  It may seem pricey but it is well made and works perfectly.  I love that I can prop my iPad horizontally or vertically. The iPad does not lock into place (I don't jump up from sitting position without holding in anyway) but after reading reviews for ones that did, I determined that those seem poorly made and the locking mechanisms were breaking.  Since it doesn't have clips it is more versatile for other e-readers.  My son has a kindle and I borrow that to take advantage of Prime's free monthly books.<br />If you are looking for a way to prop your iPad (or kindle/nook/etc) on your lap while being a couch potato or lounging in bed this is perfect for that! You can adjust to the perfect angle and relax without getting cramps in your hands while holding it! (My husband is jealous and wants one too so I will be ordering a second one soon!)  I'm actually thinking these would make excellent gift ideas for my extended family.  (Now I'm off to mark the reviews about this as helpful!)",

I'd like to offer a review somewhat different than what you've read before.  It's a long one so if you're looking for something quick, you may want to stop here.  Otherwise hopefully you'll enjoy the perspective.  My thanks go out to those who let us know who you are and what you do in your review, and how you use the system, it really makes a difference.  It's important to know the story behind why someone is buying something and what they are looking to do, otherwise you get mismatched needs and solutions.  My story begins during the first month of 2008, when I got myself  into a bit of a speaker craze while searching for a sound solution for every room of my house.  Three years ago I put my life's music collection in digital format on iTunes to the tune of over 5000 songs with perhaps the widest array of music than anyone else I know: Jazz, Hip-hop, R&B, trip hop, electronica, techno, country, audio books, Tony Robbins, metal, rock, dub, enigma type stuff, lounge, new-aje, world music, caribbean, Latin and on the list goes.  So, when I say I've tested these speakers over a wide variety of music, you can take my word for it.<br /><br />My demographic: Male, business owner (custom Italian leather journals, guest books and photo albums: see epica . com ) and hip-hop dancer choreographer, 30 years old, Southern California.  Creative, very into pleasing the senses.<br /><br />After growing up with stereo systems that catered to more bass than clarity, my initial goal was to discover what would be the most clear, best, space filling rich sound I could in each room of the house while still being incredibly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive at the best price.  I wanted to turn up the volume and be amazed at what I heard without any distortion and I wanted to be thrilled at the lowest volumes as well. I wanted to feel like I was there, to have a music experience every time I turned something on.  The best price part went out the door rather quickly.<br /><br />So here's what I did:  Apple sells a device called an Airport Express that among other things such as being a wireless router, also allows you to stream iTunes music to it wirelessly.  All you have to do is plug in a stereo mini plug to one end and an audio source to another.  Give it a name like living room and it appears in iTunes. you can have several of these devices all over the house.  In the past I have always hooked up big stereos or shelf systems to it for sound but now in the age of tiny computer speakers and iPod doc systems, I've realized you can connect anything to it and have taken the experience to a whole new level.  There are now 4 airport expresses in the house in different rooms along with an apple TV which also features this Airtunes feature in the living room,  bedroom, second bedroom, kitchen and hallway... yes the hallway.<br /><br />After having spent hours in the Apple Store and Best Buy listening to different sound docks and speakers with my iPhone and collection of music, I just decided to purchase and used every single unit that caught my interest with the decision that those which didn't give me everything I was looking for, I'd just return. (The manufacturers must love me.)  Because what can you really tell about a speaker or sound system in a 30,000 foot warehouse with sound and people all around you?  Are you kidding? Nothing. You've really got to setup these systems in your environment.<br /><br />It's also important that you test your purchase in different places and positions all throughout your house. You won't believe the difference in sound from having  say, a SounDock in your bathroom vs. a bedroom.  Move the subwoofer around, adjust the bass on it, move the speakers, be creative. you'll surprise yourself.<br /><br />Finally, a word about Bose.  Of all the sound companies that I read reviews for, and I read about 400 before making a purchase, I have never seen such a contrasting fan base.  You've got people who detest anything Bose and people who would buy it without listening to anything else. For the record I am neither of these people.  I have owned Bose products in the past and enjoyed them as I have with other companies but was not biased towards or against them prior to purchase.<br /><br />The Systems:<br /><br />The Klipsch Prop-Media 2.1 speakers were my purchase. I was attracted to what I knew about the Brand, the subwoofer control on the actual satellite speaker and the $150 price point.  I got them home and aesthetically I was just never really attracted to the speaker.  My place has a very Asian-Zen and modern feel and these just kind of stood out in the wrong way wherever I placed them.  But we're talking about sound so I looked past that. It's got a pretty large subwoofer, and the satellites where small enough to go anywhere. Klipsch does a great job with their horn tweeters and it really let's the highs soar.  I tried them in my home office and bedroom for a week before I returned them.  Why?<br />I loved that they were THX, which means there was no hissing whatsoever and they were dead quiet when music was shut off.  I was also pleased and could not  believe the power. These speakers have so much gain and get so loud, that I don't think full volume would even be tolerable to the human ear. But that was the thing. They seemed to distort at the higher volumes I tend to enjoy and didn't seem to fill a room at low volumes. The subwoofer is recommended to be set at 8 o'clock (very low) and if you adjust that any higher the bass is quite over powering.  The sound coming from the Klipsch speakers was not a bad or poor sound, it was great, it was ridiculously powerful but it just wasn't the best sound I had heard for music. They ultimately went back to the store,  and I give them a 4 star rating, but I'd be open to trying them in again in a different setting.  I think I found them to be to cumbersome as well.<br /><br />To their credit, RoomGroove wireless for $300, is their latest version of what I am doing with the airport express where you can link multiple room grooves up and they'll wireless send sound to each other. Points to them for finally getting something like this on the market.<br /><br />Logitech Z-2300 THX: WOW.  I was a little biased at first because I thought, Logitech? Really? The people who shine at making wireless mice and keyboards? How can they compare to these other big sound companies? What can they possibly bring to the table?  Five stars no question. Here I had nothing to go on other than the $150 price point. I brought them home and unpacked. Ok, the subwoofer with this speaker set is not for the faint of heart. It is absolutely enormous and well suited for a larger office or larger room.  It's got two attractive enough (without the grills) aluminum speakers, and a similar wired remote to the Bose only this has the subwoofer control on it (fortunately) and a headphone jack. (no external auxiliary mini plug)<br /><br />Where to begin. This system has started off in and remains to this day in my office.  At low volumes it is rich, deep, clear, and not overpowering in any respect. The music soars no matter what you're listening to.  It's an absolute pleasure to sit before these speakers and  I should start leaving them playing some sort of music more often because it really really sounds tremendous.  And that's only the beginning.<br /><br />Once the staff goes home and I can crank these up, every wall in the building shakes.  The other bathrooms sound as though there is an earthquake and we should evacuate the building. I know it sounds like I'm a big bass person but this is the least of my desires. The clarity, much like the companion 5's just keeps getting richer and richer as you turn the volume up. Artist's vocals scream out at you and this system is the loudest of any I have heard. Interestingly it's also the most tolerable at high volume that I have heard as well.<br /><br />I love the fact that it's got RCA jacks for speaker cables which allow you to easily extend them if you want them more than a few inches apart or want to place the subwoofer farther away than right at your feet.  I love the power and clarity of these speakers, I love that the remote has the bass on the module and you don't have to adjust it behind the subwoofer.  Five golden stars are easily awarded. Go Logitech.<br /><br />Altec Lansing T-612 and Bose SounDock Portable:<br />Having tested the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks, JBL On Stage, Klipsch iGroove, the Zeppelin monster, iHome, logitech pure fi and many others, these are the two I wound up bringing home.<br /><br />Technology is great. We give birth to new ideas which create new ways we listen to music like iPods and iTunes, and that stimulates thought to a new level and we create devices made especially just for these things like the wide array of docking stations, something we had no need for in the past, and then we give birth to new ideas again and say wouldn't it be great to have our music collection on our phone and eliminate devices, and that get's created, and one company wins out over all the others and soon that creates a new problem: cell phone interference and shielding and that gives birth to the first of a new line of products: the iPhone safe Altec T-612.  The first docking station to not be affected by sound interference from cell phones.<br /><br />It worked well. I give it 5 stars for innovation, sound, it's own bass and treble controls on the unit that can be controlled by the remote control, size and a pretty unique look. (Which I am personally not attracted to) This purchase lasted 24 hours before it was returned. It was going to be used as a hallway speaker and so probably would not get much use out of the iPod Dock.  It goes for $200 which seems reasonable.  Ultimately though it did not have the fullness and richness, or spaciousness that the Bose did, and the bass cracked on several songs.  This is perfect for a teen, or college person or someone who just listens to music here and threre at reasonable volumes in the kitchen or around the house.<br /><br />Bose SounDock Portable.  FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS, and no sale or special pricing. Certainly you have to have a unique perspective on money to purchase one of these for yourself.  One now resides in my bedroom and another in the hallway so certainly I'll share mine.  Are there alternatives on the market that you will be happy with? Absolutely.  $400 is a lot of money to spend on a device like this. Or is it?  I sell a $10,000 journal on the Epica website,  I have seen $12,000 pens, $400,000 automobiles, $200 for torn up jeans (and that's just a normal brand), $12 to see a movie, $50 for a tank of gas, $4000 for a high end washer and dryer... look at the world we live in.  Certainly dollar for dollar you are not paying for the product itself or the metal, cotton or components, EVER, but the value it brings to you. The features and luxuries and benefits it brings.  The feeling. And that always has a price.<br /><br />How many times have you shopped for the best deal on something, bought it, and then later wished you had purchased the better version, or gotten the special optional features, or wish you had just splurged after the fact. How many times have you not been able to do it like when you purchase a car? I have just gotten myself used to two things. One: happiness comes from your thoughts and your ability to keep your mind and focus on things that please you, not from objects you buy, and two, the fact that if contrast has caused me to give birth to a desire for wanting something, and I think in the obtaining of it I will be more pleased in owning it than the less expensive version,  I am going to buy the one that brings me the most pleasure and gives me personally, the best feeling.<br /><br />Need, purpose, design, size and functionality all coalesced with the SounDock and so I spent 200 more dollars after I returned the Lansing for something that would be kept in my hallway which pointed into the bathroom.  But it was more discreet, it had a revolving iPod dock that I could hide from view when not using it, a remote control that let me change my playlists (that most remotes do not do), a look that was much more attractive and streamline, and a sound that was just richer and fuller.<br /><br />And while it pains me immensely to know that I took the two-hundred heart pounding watts of Klipsch out of my bedroom, the amazing, clear, spacious and dynamic sound of the Bose Companion 3s out of my bedroom and now have replaced those with another SounDock, portable, it certainly does create magic in the bedroom.  Aside from two lamps, it is the ONLY other wire in the room. It's small, and doubles as my alarm clock. I LOVE the  fact that I can wake up to any song or play list in the world.  using an iPod  (I am very put off by Apple's decision to not have a snooze button on iPod alarm, while it is on the iPhone, however on the iPhone you can only wake up to a ringtone! Silly)  I love how it fills a room and how if you're not in the room you hear it loud and clear and would have no idea something so small is producing all that sound.<br /><br />I have really come to appreciate Bose. They create the best sound they can possibly engineer by pouring 100% of their profits back into research and deliver the best product they can that generally takes years to release. They think their sound sounds best flat, with no adjustment. That's what the EQ is for on the iPod or iTunes or whatever source you're using. They realize you shouldn't have to tweak all the treble and bass if the sound is just amazing to begin with.  It's all about the feeling you get when you listen to it.  The SounDock does not sound as good as a system like the Companion  3's or any other subwoofer driven device but you have to look at it's purpose and size.<br /><br />SounDock gets five stars for listening to customer requests and making their successful SounDock portable even better by adding the aux in port so I can hear music wirelessly, a great remote with lots of functionality, discreet touch volume buttons,  a hideaway revolving dock door to make it look even cleaner than it already does, a great room filling sound, a battery that lasts, a slimmer design, a power cord that wraps around the transformer and an overall sound that makes you feel very good when listening to it.  Try placing one of these things in your kitchen, hall, bathroom, closet or smaller room and listen to the rumble and sound. Amazing.<br /><br />Bose Companion 3's: When I first set these up in my office I was absolutely amazed by the quality and quantity of sound coming out of these speakers.  They are gorgeous, discrete and fit the bill for big sound.  I was impressed by the fact that I could turn them up to full volume, with any kind of music and here no distortion of any kind. That one fact is so rare, that made them a winner for me right there.  When listening to Diana Krall, I felt as though her lips where inches from my ear as she sang only to me.  These speakers really sing out.<br />For some reason when I tried watching movies on them, the volume decreased significantly and so even at full blast the sound was not that loud. Over time these speakers have moved from office to bedroom to ultimately being returned to the store but not  because I was dissatisfied. I kept these things in my closet for 3 weeks because I didn't want to return them, I wanted to find a use for them or somewhere to enjoy them.  They went back because I didn't want 5 cords in my bedroom and a subwoofer at the foot of my bed.<br /><br />Like the companion 5's, I like the puck volume control  (would be nice if it was wireless, wouldn't it? Especially if everything else on your desk is).  It's very sensitive and feels good to touch. One gentle tap and sound is muted, another and it comes back on.  It's also nice to be able to increase or decrease the bass that pours out of these units on the back of the subwoofer by virtually a full 360 degrees.  I am also pleased with the RCA jacks used to connect each speaker. Initially I was put off and wondered why they did it but when I realized how EFFORTLESS (one of my favorite words) it was to extend the speaker cable, i.e.  just plug in another video cable, I was thrilled.  Five stars to the Companion 3s<br /><br />Bose Companion 5's: It's funny how when you don't know what you're missing, you don't miss it.  I tell people that in my business that when you buy this $185 journal and you haven't seen the $265 version, you think you're in heaven. It's perfection.  Then you see the top of the line and you just can't imagine it gets any better. The Companion 5's are nearly triple the size of the Companion 3's (Yet still rather small and attractive), look absolutely gorgeous next to my iMac, have the same puck with mute, headphones, volume up and down and auxiliary input just like the Companion 3's (which will play something at simultaneously as what you have going on your computer).<br /><br />BUT there are two major differences in these speakers vs anything else I have heard, ever. One is it connects to your USB port, not your stereo mini plug in port which requires 2 minutes of configuring, and two, the sound that comes out of these speakers is the most delicious, exquisite, full, wide, spacious, rich, detailed sound I have EVER heard come out of speakers in this class.  Anyone I have shared them with leaves with their jaw on the floor. As I turn up the volume we just stare at the computer and say WOW.  It just sucks you in. Where  before I did not enjoy spending time in front of the computer for very long, I can literally spend hours in front of this one or in the room where the Companion 5's are playing. The sound is that unbelievable.  The cables as of this writing are proprietary and cannot be extended, however for the `surround effect' it's not recommended that you extend them anyway.<br /><br />I enjoy barely audible volume levels in the morning but come nighttime, I love to crank up the sound and  speakers can take it at a volume so loud you can only take it for a short period. It's as though with each increment you raise the volume, you experience a new dimension to sound.  The Bose Companion 5's for this purpose get 5 stars, 10 if I could, for looks, size and for a sound like no other.<br /><br />Finally, don't be led astray by the Bose advertising. These speakers are marketed towards people who like to watch movies in front of their computer, something that, after spending all day in front of a computer, is the last thing I want to do.  I've tried it and yes it's a great experience but if you never watch a video clip with these speakers it will still be the  best investment you make for music and any other sound that comes out of them.  The Bose experts will also tell you that these speakers should not be more than 24 inches apart because they are specifically engineered for you to sit right in front of them. When I heard that I also thought the sound quality would decrease if I stepped away, or perhaps it wouldn't fill a room the way I want.  Not the case. Inches away or across the room, I cannot say enough about this virtual surround sound speaker.<br /><br />So hopefully that gives you a little more insight into what these speakers can do for you, how they can be used, what I was looking for in particular and what the actual experience was.  If you made it this far, your a trooper.  I hope you found the review useful and if you wanted to contact me with questions we actually sell on the Amazon site.  Just do a search for Epica journal and you can write in.

I've tried it and yes it's a great experience but if you never watch a video clip with these speakers it will still be the  best investment you make for music and any other sound that comes out of them.  The Bose experts will also tell you that these speakers should not be more than 24 inches apart because they are specifically engineered for you to sit right in front of them. When I heard that I also thought the sound quality would decrease if I stepped away, or perhaps it wouldn't fill a room the way I want.  Not the case. Inches away or across the room, I cannot say enough about this virtual surround sound speaker.      So hopefully that gives you a little more insight into what these speakers can do for you, how they can be used, what I was looking for in particular and what the actual experience was.  If you made it this far, your a trooper.  I hope you found the review useful and if you wanted to contact me with questions we actually sell on the Amazon site.  Just do a search for Epica journal and you can write in. Thanks! - Written over three hours near Los Angeles in the company of Bose Companion 5's.",

After reading some of the reviews I was a little hesitant to get it, but it seemed overall to be the best drive available.  My initial backup was rather disappointing.  It took 24 hours to backup 29G/163K files.  I was starting to think about returning it. Then, the admin control panel for the drive indicated there was a driver update available.    After getting the driver update things have been much better.  That same backup now takes about an hour, using the included software (Genie Backup Manager Pro). I am not using file compression because I want to be able to use the standard explorer to get any needed files when the time comes. I am running a 100M Ethernet and have seen the backup use 90+% of the net capacity while transfering files. The PC is a new i7 processor, so it is quick.  There are lull periods during the backup; I assume while the software is determining what to backup next.    My only complaint is with the backup software. Comparing it with the software that came with my older backup drive; it is harder to find a backed-up file if I need to. I have not tried the restore features of Genie Backup Manager; so, this complaint may be addressed there.  My older backup drive's software organized the backup in latest, 2nd oldest, and so on directories so it was easy to find the first, second and 3rd oldest version of a specific file.  Genie Backup Pro just makes a copy, organized by the date of the backup. So, if I want something that I changed a while ago, I have to search all the backups until I find it.  Someday, I may try the restore capabilities of the software and see how they handle this.  For now, it is not a priority.",

The other one snapped in my computer bag and one earpiece was left dangling. That was kinda' my fault but I'm guessing more sturdily constructed earphones might've held up. If you'll follow my advice, you'll get a headset with a case.    If you're debating it, spend $30 dollars more and get a good wireless headset. You won't miss the dangling cord for one thing and you won't be tethered to your computer whenever you have to dial out from your PC. I got a pair from ASUS for $50 bucks and I'm thrilled so far.

Starting with the i5 processor at 2.6 Ghz is more than I could have asked for at the price point. Coupled with an outstanding, new laptop graphics card in the 730m can handle most/all games on medium to high settings at a decent fps(60). Games such as Battlefield 3 will not even be at 60 at the low/medium settings, but that is to be expected; this is not a gaming laptop. I know that this sounds like a advertisement for the product, but the laptop exceeded my expectations immensely, and you will find if you read on.<br /><br />Along the the great CPU and GPU comes a whopping 8GB of RAM, which is more than the average consumer will need, and more than I need for gaming. A 750GB HDD can store all your music, videos, movies, and anything else you desire without running out of room. Speaking of not running out of room, this laptop packs a 17 inch screen! The brightness is well scaled and the colors are well saturated, albeit a touch washed out. Moving on from the specs, the computer itself does not work up a heat at all, even when gaming. Compared to my previous laptop, a 2011 Macbook Pro, this is the North Pole. The keyboard is better than a Macbook Pro, in my opinion. It gives you a lot more room to type, and includes an numbered keypad. The laptop is also very lightweight, which surprised me due to its large frame. The black finish and top cover are very stylish, with a simple \\\\\"acer\\\\\" brand on the top.<br /><br />Now, on to the cons. The battery life definitely leaves something to be desired,it will barely last 2 hours unplugged. This isn't a problem for me however, as I keep mine plugged in 90% of the time. I imagine this wont be much of a con for other users either, as this laptop is not designed with portability in mind.<br />The 2nd problem that I have encountered is the laptop sometimes fails to charge when launching a game.This has happened once to me.  It switches from chargingto not charging without me doing anything, and the brightness flickers due to the apparent unplugging and plugging in of the laptop. However, this can be solved with a simple restart, but I wanted to put this in my review.<br /><br />No other laptop that I have owned has delivered these specs at under $1000, while performing this well with a 17inch screen. I would have given this 5 stars if the battery life had been improved, but some nitpicks can be expected with a sub-$800 laptop.

I do most of my computer work on the other monitor so that if I want to I can switch this one to HD TV via my cable tuner.      That all works more or less, but a big problem is that when my two monitors are coming out of screen saver mode, the other monitor comes out almost immediately and this T240HD takes up to a minute.  That's a really long time to wait.  If it was my primary monitor or only monitor on my computer that would be a huge problem.  I'm using the DVI connector and a digital connection to my video card.  I don't know if the problem also exists in VGA mode as I haven't bothered to try that.    The screen also though very nice doesn't have as much viewing angle as my other monitor.  Probably a good compromise to save on manufacturing cost- this unit is cheap for what it does.  Still, when I buy my next monitor some day, I won't buy one of these due to that big fat delay.",

I had to experiment a bit to get a good position in the Jetta's close quarters, but finally I placed it so the display is in front of the vents above the radio.  When the AC is on, the display can be moved out to allow air movement. It is closer to the steering wheel, but not too close for comfort.  When the AC is off, the display is snug against the vents and easy to see. It fit well in the Ranger with little experimentation.<br /><br />Initially I had a problem with the display vibrating. Tightening 4 set screws on the extension resolved the issue.<br /><br />The mount seems to be made with quality materials, suitable for the application.  The suction cup is very good, and I've had to carefully insert a thin knife blade to release the vacuum. The instructions warn about breaking the glass.<br /><br />Bottom line: it works well and I'd buy it again.",

He listens to music and watches videos on his laptop all the time, so he was thrilled when I hooked these up so he could have better audio. Everything sounds so much clearer and music played from them sounds tons better.<br /><br />They were really easy to set up. The cables come already connected to the speakers. So all you have to do is plug in the USB cable to the computer (powers the speakers), then plug the auxiliary cable into the earphone jack on the computer (when using with a laptop). Corded speakers like this are especially handy for young users like my son, because he doesn't need to go into the computer's control panel to set it up (which he would if they were cordless/Bluetooth). Computers automatically switch to playing the audio through the earphone jack when they sense something has been connected. So as soon as he plugs the cable in, his laptop automatically starts playing the audio through them. No need to change the computer's speaker settings in the control panel. With a desktop, they plug in on the port in the back designated for use with speakers.<br /><br />These speakers sound even better than I had hoped for. And their small size and very simple set up makes them perfect for using with a laptop. There is a volume nob on the back of one of the speakers, so you can turn it one way or the other to adjust the volume. The cables have plenty of length to them, so they can be set up on a desk and spread apart quite a bit.They come in a bunch of fun colors too. The blue us a great looking shiny royal blue.

The first thing that caught my attention about the G35 set is the red light on the mic to let you know it is muted, and the 7.1 virtual sound, so I figured I would take a shot.    Pros:  - They sound good  - The volume roller is easy to use and is software based so you are actually adjusting Windows volume level.  - The mute button is easy to get to (and the already mentioned red light on the mic)  - The mic pics up sound very well  - The bass is a little stronger than DSP500's, but only slightly.    Cons:  - Logitech decided to use their braided cord that will FOREVER hold bends and will never just hang loose  - Ear sweat...  these things do not breathe (if you like ear sweat, put this in the pros column)  - The \\\\\"pad\\\\\" that rests on top of your head is not soft at all, and the 2 additional ones they provide are just bigger than the first  - Massive, you can't just slide these on, they take both hands to pry open   - Skull crushing, they basically rely on squeezing your head to fit properly  - Lack of audio controls, you get bass and treble, that is it  - They are more effective than ear plugs, you could be run over by a train and never know it (this may be a pro for some people)    The reason I kept my DSP500's for so long is because I could wear them for hours and hours and completely forget I was wearing them.  They also did not block any of the outside noise so I could easily talk to someone or listen for something while wearing them.  I can wear the G35's for about 2 hours before my ears feel gross, and the pressure starts to bother me.  I have to wonder if they are not a danger to little kids with soft skulls...  you might end up with a conehead kid if they wear these a lot.    I honestly can't tell you what other headset you should get, but for the price of these G35's I would recommend getting something else.  With the G35 you are paying for gimmick and look, not for quality sound hardware.      UPDATE:  After having this headset for a while there are a few more bad things unfortunately.  The material covering the ear pads will start to peel off after a while, mine are almost completely gone.  It starts with the material cracking and breaking off (looks like they used the wrong glue) and you will be left with chunks of black material on your neck and clothes.    I still use mine, but only because of the excellent sound and bass they produce, as well as the lit mute indicator and mute button.

It would automatically fit all the text on one page and adjust fonts (size) accordingly.<br />Home screen - I would rather have an Android or iPad look to it. With dedicated icons for each app and a background screen you can customize<br />Touchscreen - Not as smooth and sensitive as my iPad or even my Evo 4g Android. I'm hoping this could be tweaked with a software update.<br />Apps - There will be more, but at the moment it's pretty sparse. It should also have a dedicated Facebook and Twitter app. Not a link to the web version.<br />Email - Unless I missed it.

I don't know what went wrong and lost couple of disks because of this. Another reason I gave only 4 stars is that the backup software (not related to DVD conversion) does not seem to work well with 1.1 USB ports.  <br /> <br />The installation instructions could have been better.  <br /> <br />Another reviewer mentioned that they had problems with no video signal after a couple of conversions.

By far, this is the absolute best Kindle or e-Reader I've ever owned or used. The lighting is absolutely helpful in the best ways ever and not intrusive or irritable in any way. My apartment has a low lighting and it's perfect for it. I've also used it outside and had no issues seeing the screen and in bed with all the lights off. I've read about shadowing from the lighting but mine doesn't really have it. If it does, I haven't noticed it. While I liked playing games or looking at magazines on the iPad & Fire --- I never could enjoy reading books. I always got headaches from using them.  The Paperwhite is the best e-Reader for books and heavy readers. Obviously, the $119 price tag isn't good for someone who will read one or two books. The design is the best yet. It's small and compact and like holding an extremely thin paperback book. The touch screen is amazing and I love the sort of scratchy surface rather than the slick ones of the Fire & iPad, etc.  My favorite thing is the built in dictionary. You just press down on a word and it immediately shows you the definition. I haven't hit a word that wasn't available yet. As for the battery life; I've charged it one time and have read three entire 300+ page books on the device. Speaks for itself. Awesome. I can't rave it enough, it's changed my life! Haha. My only negative complaint is that new novels in the Kindle store are not much different than the price of a hardcover book and range from $9.99 - $14.99. Seems kind of steep for a digital experience. Either way, I'll never use another device but the Kindle Paperwhite.

This has more activity switches than its 3500 brother -- tilt switches on the wheel and an extra thumb-operated switch on the left side.  All of these are rather inconvenient to use.  The tilt switches (and now the wheel switch itself) requires a determined push and the thumb switch is located rather inconveniently, though I suppose that this was done to minimize the chance of inadvertent operation.  The latest mouse software offers quite an array of button programming options, including a very useful macro function.  This is a significant upgrade from the 3500.  Microsoft's new post-Intellipoint driver software is a worthwhile upgrade.  I like the R and L button click feel a lot, but especially like the high-resolution smooth-scroll wheel.  That alone makes this a \\\\\"must\\\\\" upgrade from the 3500.  If you're patient, you can find these occasionally at the same low promotional price as the 3500, which is a good time to grab a couple of them.<br /><br />It has the usual stowable micro R/T.  There's not much to say about this as it seems to work fine without any discernible temperature rise as some of the older ones had.  I can't comment on range because the mouse and receiver are separated by only a few inches where I use them.<br /><br />On the down side, the battery consumption of this is every bit as miserable as the 3500: -1 star.  It will chew through an ordinary alkaline AA in two or three weeks.  Having learned my lesson a long time ago, I use NiMH rechargeables and have a few charged cells handy everywhere one of these critters is in use.  What has always puzzled me about this is that the older version with the typical flash-drive-sized receiver (WMM-3000 typically) would run for months on one rechargeable NiMH AA.  Months.  Without ever turning it off.  So Microsoft...  why did you screwthis up?  The blue LED?<br /><br />I still can't figure out the \\\\\"pink\\\\\" part of the color description.  The one I got is a very attractive medium dark metallic red. IOW nothing that would threaten anyone's manhood if caught using it.<br /><br />Bottom line: They're a great buy on sale.

The battery life seems to be fairly good -- unlike some of the older Android 2.x tablets that I've had, the Premium 7se with ICS 4.0 seems to do a good job of conserving battery life if you forget to shut it off and just let it go into standby mode on its own.  I left mine on last night when I went to bed, and when I went to turn it on this morning it came on immediately as it came out of \\\\\"sleep\\\\\" mode (the boot-up is quick, but not as fast as \\\\\"waking up\\\\\") -- I expected the battery to be pretty well drained, but I was very surprised to find it still had about three \\\\\"bars\\\\\" left on the battery.<br /><br />The wireless functionality seemed to be a big drain on most of my previous tablets as well, but even with the wireless on constantly, the battery doesn't seem to drain faster than when I've got the wireless disabled.<br /><br />For me, this tablet does everything I need -- it's NOT an iPad, and it's not a Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire, but the display is sharp, it runs all the apps I need it to run, it's great for casual web browsing, and honestly, it's the best Android device I've had to date.<br /><br />One helpful tip -- the form factor (height and width, anyway) seems to be an almost exact match for the Kindle Fire.  This is important, because that means that cases designed for the Kindle Fire WILL work well with the NextBook Premium 7se.<br /><br />I purchased a ([[ASIN:B007V9O2FC YooMee Black Amazon Kindle Fire 7 Inch Android Tablet Leather Case Cover Folio with Multi-Angle Stand and Hand Strap (Black)(NOT Compatible with Fire HD)]]) and it's a PERFECT fit for the Premium 7se.  This is the best tablet case I've found -- it's exactly what I was looking for, in fact, and it does a great job of protecting my Premium 7se.<br /><br />If you want a solid Android tablet with the latest OS but don't have the money to spend on a Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire, the E FUN NextBook Premium 7se is DEFINITELY worth looking at -- and I think it's the best value you can find right now in terms of the current crop of 7\\\\\" Android tablets.",

Fortunately, they're only on the lock screen and if I choose I can pay the $20 one time to have them go away forever.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% convinced that the Wi-Fi was the right choice, since part of the point of a Kindle (for me) is the ability to get a new book the second I'm done with the one I'm reading. However, there is Wi-Fi almost everywhere. So far it hasn't come up.<br /><br />The device itself is very nice, with a more crisp page than my Kindle Keyboard. The light feature is the sole reason I decided to upgrade, but it was well worth it. The only thing that I'm still having a hard time getting used to a month after purchase is the lack of back/forward buttons. The Kindle Keyboard was a little easier to use one-handed since it had a &#34;page forward&#34; and &#34;page back&#34; button along either edge. With the Paperwhite, if I'm holding the book in my right hand I cannot go backwards with one hand. If I am holding the book in my left hand (which is most common for me, since I'm right hand dominant and typically using that hand to eat, cook, etc. as I read) I have to stretch my left hand uncomfortably to change the page. (Please note, this may not be an issue for all users. I have carpal tunnel in my hands and have a more restricted range of motion as a result)<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing device which I heartily recommend.

The goal was to bridge a network where the EOC-5611 and it's predecessor, the now discontinued EOC-5610, were 240 feet apart. With direct unobstructed line-of-sight, mounted atop a 25' mast, and fitted with high-quality ethernet cable, the signal began to fade at 100 feet and was completely degraded by 150 feet, regardless of band or antenna type used. The unit likewise performed as poorly when used as an access point. A good signal could be achieved between 80-100 feet, but dropped so significantly that a connection could not be made past 150 feet.    In my tests, this unit failed to produce more than 10mW using the internal panel antenna and no more than 13mW using a 9dBi external omni-directional antenna for both the 802.11a and 802.11b/g bands - nowhere near the company's 600mW claim and more akin to consumer-grade indoor access points in the sub-$50 price range offered by LinkSys, NetGear, or Belkin.    Interestingly, phone conversations with the technical support personnel at EnGenius revealed that the unit, when fitted with the external omni antenna mentioned above, could expect to reach only a maximum of 400mW and that the internal antenna was only for the 802.11a band... that an external antenna was necessary if one wished to use the 802.11b/g band. They suggested that I spend hundreds more per unit for a parabolic, yagi, or patch directional antenna to achieve a strong signal for the 240' distance I required. Amazing... the advertising boasts that this unit is \\\\\"high-power\\\\\" commercial-grade client premises equipment, easily capable of 1-30kmtransmission range. Yet, in reality, I can throw a baseball a greater distance than this unit can transmit a wireless signal!    Based on the information presented here, at Amazon, and information and data sheets obtained at the EnGenius web site, I recommended this product to a client with a low-budget for the client/bridge solution. What should have been a quick and easy install resulted in many hours of on-site configuration and troubleshooting, and ultimately caused a strained client relationship. Although I salvaged the client, it cost me an additional $1300 to replace these units with a pair of D-Link DWL-2700AP's to do so. They work flawlessly and I have never looked back.    If I could give Zero stars for this product, I would. Unless you love headaches, frustration, and losing clients... run away, run far away from the EOC-5610/EOC-5611.",

Even when I'm on the computer that is in the same room as the router, which is the only time I can use the 5 GHZ signal, it seems sluggish and takes a long time to boot up just simple you tube videos. I never had a problem streaming netflix to multiple devices in the past, but now if one person is using it, the other person's device is greatly affected.<br /><br />My husband has an app on his phone that tells you what the internet speed is and we were surprised to find it running at less than 1 MBPS; we had between 3 and 4 before. When we click the wifi off and go on cellular, it shoots back up to 4 mbps. Now, I guess it's possible that there's some magical setting that I need to tinker with, or change the IP address or whatever, but I really really hate having to jump through hoops to get things to work the way they are supposed to.

I was worried first when I tried to read it via my card reader attached to my computer and the computer said it needed to be formatted that it was unreadable as it was.  (I always check for bonus software installed on memory cards before I format them for use.)  I didn't think much about it but then tried to format it in the camera but the camera couldn't format it.  I went back to my computer to format it there and see if that might fix things but the computer said it couldn't format it and the card was not usable.<br /><br />The price was astoundingly good for an 800X (120 Mbps) card.  The SanDisk at 400X (60 Mbps) costs more than this one at 800X. Maybe that should have been a clue.  Another clue that I chose to ignore was that I noticed reviews had consistently higher ratings on SanDisk over Lexar and some even mentioned that the Lexar didn't work but when a SanDisk was used the problem went away.<br /><br />Thankfully, the Amazon return process is so easy.  I have a SanDisk replacement on order.  Sadly, it will be the 60 Mbps version but a slower-working card is better than one that doesn't work at all.",

Since I work in an office where I keep the lights turned off (fluorescent lighting tied into another larger room my office is built off of) I like having the illuminated keyboard.<br /><br />I had tried another earlier this week, and it was horrible.  It felt bad, there was a really useless raised palmrest part in front that was NOT removable, and every time I hit the space bar with my thumb, the joint hit that raised part and after just a few sentences, started to feel annoyingly sore, so I returned it ASAP.<br /><br />This one looks decent, but the keys are just a bit less responsive than I prefer as a fast touch typist.  That's why I dinged a star.  I do like the rheostat for volume, as opposed to just up/down keys, but I feel they missed a chance to have a push to click on it as well for an instant mute.  But it works well for volume, and was one of the things that made me pick this keyboard.<br /><br />I wish there were selectable colors, since the blue is a bit subdued, and like right now in my office, with some light coming through the open door from the tech area outside, some keys are more readily visible than others.  Some of the letters and numbers look really striated, so there's lines and bits of them that don't light up well, so it's totally inconsistent.<br /><br />I also see that the day the keyboard arrived, the price suddenly jumped up about 16 dollars.  If it was still at the higher price, I'd say it's not worth it, but I got it for under twenty five, and for that price, the imperfections and mushy feel are expected and acceptable.<br /><br />The feet raise the tilt angle slightly, and I like the fact that I can keep the palm rest off.  I won't use the windows key lock feature, since on Windows 8 and Windows 10 I use that quite a bit since that's how I start my searches for files or programs, but I know some people who would love to have that option.<br /><br />All told, for an inexpensive keyboard, it feels inexpensive, but it has at least a modicum of backlight (on/off options only though, no intensity) and for the cost I paid, it was worth it.how I start my searches for files or programs, but I know some people who would love to have that option.<br /><br />All told, for an inexpensive keyboard, it feels inexpensive, but it has at least a modicum of backlight (on/off options only though, no intensity) and for the cost I paid, it was worth it.",

As a new builder you might think &#34;Hmm for $80 which is a decent amount of money, this is probably a decent power supply, especially because it comes from Corsair, a reputable hardware company.&#34; I hate to say it but that is WRONG. Corsair makes fantastic cases, fans, cooling solutions, and RAM, but they do NOT make great power supply units. Even their top tier units are not fantastic, and this CX series is the lowest of the low tier. This power supply created huge amount of coil whine when used with two different 970 graphics cards. I returned this power supply and purchased a EVGA 850W G2 to replace it and surpise surprise i now hear ZERO noise. If you are planning on doing nothing but browsing this internet this power supply might work out for you, but beware it has a combination of Japanese and Taiwanese capacitors, instead of all Japanese which are far higher quality. Also note that this is a bronze rated power supply, and for only a little bit more money you can get a gold or platinum rated power supply that will be much more reliable. This PSU is a ticking time bomb waiting to take our your entire build. I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this unit, and instead opt for a much much better quality PSU like the EVGA G2 series such as the 750W G2 or 850W G2.",

Forza 5 excels in several ways and has miner setbacks that seem to cripple the game outweighing the fun factor. As sad as I am by this I will say the game is a blast to play! Starts you off like most racers and you build your way up by either buying more cars or upgrading your initial car. The graphical improvements are a huge leap forward from the previous forza games thus the background and foreground are immaculate. The new rumble triggers is a excellent idea that will allow you to hit a rumble strip on either side of the car and not only visually see the impact but feel it as well. The cars have a large improvement on physics; that when you turn in a car with under steer it will in fact feel like one and over steer it will truly feel as such. Every single car in the game has its only forza vista to were you can be informed every single thing about the car of your choosing. All of the tracks have had major overhauls to the graphics. I often find myself doing a solo race and just slowly drive admire ring the sear detail of the tracks. The AI improvement (driveatar) is one of the best improvements to a racing game in history of racing games. Having players around the world determine the driving path of ai in your race...Simply amazing.<br /><br /> All of the above might sound like a perfect game however it has some setbacks that should be addressed. First and foremost the number of tracks and cars have been cut in &#34;half&#34; or more than literal half its more like cut down to a 3rd. The overhaul to graphics and physics and forza vista is great but I found the vista type part of the game to be a complete waste on some cars. If I wanted to learn about a 83 beetle I would go buy one with a handful of cents. (figuratively speaking) I found after around 10hours of racing that the tracks already are becoming a repetitive annoyance. Some of my favorite tracks have been removed for unknown reasons to the community thus far. And after my experience with forza 5 the lack of in game funding makes racing not really worth doing career. If I put all settings off and expert difficulty racing exotic cars for a full season 10races of ranging laps from 3-4 and my payout for each race in 1st 8-10k seems less worth it to try and get gold on every race. Some of these cars will not be attained till most if not all seasons are completed. Lotus f1 is 6mill after each season I find myself at around 200-300k and it takes about 1 hour to complete a full season. At this point in my playing in I'm not sure if new seasons overlap the current completed ones. So far no new seasons have popped up leading me to believe that you are forced to reset the season after completing it. And forced to re-do the 10 tracks over and over again.<br /><br />In summary forza 5 is a excellent game for launch of a new system. However I think in the next few months to come they will release updates to address issues players are having with the game so far. Expect to pay for the new tracks and new cars that are to come in time.",

Don't know how long it will last, but it is recognized and charging at the moment.  I should also add that the rubber feet on battery, which keep it from scratching the table beneath them, came off within the first 3 days of use.  Clearly shoddy glue used.  So, add $2.50 for some superglue, which has kept them attached since.<br /><br />Leaving the review at one star for now.  If I'm still using the battery in a month--and my house hasn't burned down--I'll upgrade it to two stars.",

I didn't do a lot of research on this Alfa WiFi Adapter prior to buying this...so trying to install it was a hassle.  The CD that this product came with was USELESS.  So i had to go online to the ALFA Website to get the current Driver to install it onto my Mac.  The site only offered 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 versions...NO 10.7 (OSX Lion)!!! WHAT THE F***!  Well DO NOT WORRY!  I went ahead and downloaded 10.6 and everything worked out fine! I'll show you how to do that next....<br /><br />First download version 10.6 driver for mac.  Second,  you are going to have to go on YouTube and click this link and watch the video...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Next, open up the \\\\\"Terminal\\\\\" in your Mac.  You have to input this command into the Terminal \\\\\"sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\\\\\" (To set Lion in 32bits mode), reboot, install the' driver (For 10.6 on alpha website), reboot again, and tadaaaaa :D<br /><br />If you follow every step in the video, you will have no issues! I only had one proble with this though, but nothing big. Everytime I unplugged my Adapter, I would have to input this command into the Terminal everytime I used it.  \\\\\"sudo kextutil -t -v [...]\\\\\"  it is the code to run the Realtek program.<br /><br />Trust me this does work!  It would be so much easier if Alfa just had an updated driver!  Other than that, this product is great for long ranges!  I would recommend getting a USB 2.0 Extension / Repeater cable Male to Female.  Hope this helped out!",

Everyone in the call could hear even background sounds that weren't even that loud such as wind from outside and rain, both things that never caused issues with previous headsets.

There's nothing that holds the lid to the rest of the case, so you have to hold it yourself.  So why even have the handle???  I like that the tablet is held in by a velcro tab, but I had originally though the velcro had something to do with holding the case open.  So that's disappointing but I guess at least the tablet isn't sliding out.  The part that goes around the screen is awkward for me personally.  All ports and buttons ARE accessible, even the sd slot area which often isn't, but it's not easy with the edge hanging over to push the power button.  I can't just push it, I have to feel around and then the case itself gets in the way of me being able to actually push it down easily at first.  This closes nice and flat though, and the magnet to auto sleep/wake works. Lastly, the case was dirty when I got it, dark smudges on the inside etc.  The whole thing looks like it was rubbing against something dark that stained it.

Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.<br /><br />Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba.

I'm glad I tried one more time! One of the most helpful features that sets this netbook apart from others, are the \\\\\"chicklet\\\\\" keys. They help you type so much more easily in the smaller space of netbooks. I also love the matte finish, because it doesn't show fingerprints and random dirt as easily as a lot of the shiny, plastic finishes that a lot of the other netbooks have. I installed the extra 1gb of ram myself, and I'm no techie. You just buy a 2gb pc2-5300 cls 200 sodimm card, and watch the youtube video on how to put it in. Easy. This little netbook is fast, holds all of the files, pics, and music from my old laptop, and has tons of memory to spare. It's easy to surf the web on, connects to wireless from anywhere, and... best of all... it fits in my purse to take to work, and lasts all day without having to bring a charger with me! Everyone said that I wouldn't be happy with a netbook, because they are too small, but the resolution on this one is higher than on most netbooks, and this screen is crisp, clear, and easy to read. I got a program that let me work around the windows starter version, because it doesn't let you set your own photos on the desktop, etc. Once I downloaded a little free program I got by searching google, I was instantly able to set whatever photos I wanted as a background without buying the full windows 7. I've got the adobe c5s master collection (dreamweaver, flash editor, photoshop, & more) and the whole microsoft office 2007 suite(word, publisher, access, excel, powerpoint, outlook, infopoint), Sibeleus, Picasa, and iTunes installed on it, and they run flawlessly with multiple windows open at once. I don't think there are many things this little netbook won't do. The only complaint I have is that the internal speakers are a little soft. I just have to get some external speakers for it.",

It took less than 3 minutes to get a tech on chat. He actually helped me get the drive working wirelessly with BOTH devices in a reasonable amount of time. All it took was a firmware update.<br /><br />My experience out-of-the-box I would put at two stars. It's just frustrating for it to ship non-functional. HOWEVER, because of the customer service, and my working with the drive since, I have to rate it top notch.

I purchased the SATA III version in anticipation of a future laptop upgrade,the 2008 Macbook I currently own only supports SATA II,but SATA III is backwards compatible so no problem there. I proceeded to remove my DVD drive and install the new SSD,my plan was to also keep my existing hard drive in the primary HDD slot.I then booted up the computer and attempted to partition the drive,so I can install a fresh copy of Lion on it and begin using it.The Mac OS X Disk Utility beachballed for around 3 minutes,which I thought was odd, and then displayed the list of drives,the SSD drive being one of them. The partitioning and formatting process took about 30 minutes,which I also thought was very odd. Once the formatting process completed I tried to copy a 3.8GB iso file onto the SSD to test it's functionality,the first 150MB copied and then it stopped copying and went once again to bechballing. I was unable to un-freeze the system without holding down the power button. I went to the manufacturer's website to see if there are any known issues with this drive in OS X,I was able to find a problem where the drive negotiates a link of 1.5Gbps rather than 3 ,along with a bootable iso image that applied a fix.Well I had just removed the DVD drive from the laptop,so I took the drive back out,put it in the main hard drive slot next to the battery,put the DVD drive back in and proceeded to apply the fix. Once the fix was applied , I took the DVD drive back out ,put my original hard drive back in,and proceeded to boot up OS X and see if the link speed issue had been resolved.Sure enough,the link was now showing 3Gbps. The SSD drive was still refusing to work properly though,I once again tried copying a file , no luck there,also a disk benchmarking utility I got from the app store,which just froze completely.I then thought I would see if maybemy Mac OS installation was somehow corrupted and booted up Windows 7 via Boot Camp. The SSD drive showed up in the list of drives,and after re-formatting as FAT32 I once again tried copying a  file onto it. This also resulted in a complete computer freeze , and had to hold down the power button to completely reset the system.All in all I probably had to hard reset my laptop around 30 times in my attempt to get this drive working.I have gone back to the manufacturer's suport forums to look for further solutions and posts about the freezing issue in Macbook Pros seemed to keep  popping up like mushrooms after a rain. After failing to get this drive working(and believe me I tried hard,I was very excited about having the SSD),the drive is going back to Amazon and will be replaced by a Samsung SSD,which will hopefully work out a lot better.If you are thinking of purchasing and installing this in your Macbook Pro,be prepared for frustration.Your Macbook may work fine,mine didn't(version 5,1),and I saw tens of other posts on their Mac and Linux support forums reporting the freezing issue.If you are still going to purchase this drive,the following advice may save you a lot of time and frustration:   - Go to the OCZ support forums and see if anyone with your model Macbook is reporting issues.   - Download and burn the iso containing the 1.5/3 Gbps fix for Macbook Pro users BEFORE you remove the DVD drive.You will need it afterwards as this seems to be a common issue with these drives.   - If you are going to have two hard drives in your laptop,install the other drive in the DVD slot,and not the SSD,chances are you will need to take it out and send it back,and you don't want to keep having to take your laptop apart.  - After moving your existing drive to the DVD slot,don't screw everything back together completely.Plug in the SSD and boot up to see if it's negotiating a 3 Gbps link.If not,remove the HDD caddy and plug your DVD drive back in so you can boot off the CD you burned and apply the manufacturer's fix.  - After putting the laptop back together, test your SSD drive to make sure you can copy a large file off of your existing drive.  - If all is working well for you,consider yourself lucky.",

Kind of annoying.  <br />2) The keyboard and mouse take some time to \\\\\"wake up\\\\\" after being left alone.  <br />3) It's BIG. When did keyboards become huge behemoths with tons of useless buttons? Small bluetooth keyboards unfortunately seem to be hard to find though so I settled for this, (the logitech was more expensive at the time and seemed flimsy at the store) but if I could do it all over again I'd look a bit harder and find something smaller.  <br />4) I had to disable the scroll wheel on the mouse because it went haywire. Web pages would suddenly constantly scroll up and down or the volume would suddenly go up and down wildly. I haven't re-activated it. Also the left mouse button became suddenly reassigned for no reason one time, I had to change it back to single click.  <br /> <br />Battery life: I've had it now for about 4 months and I've changed the batteries on the keyboard around 3 times and the mouse around 4 or 5. There needs to be a way to turn off the mouse as is always on, this would save battery life. <br /> <br />I'd rate it a 3: If you need a setup for long distance it works, but the keyboard and mouse issues make it annoying and it might be too big for a home theater setup.

Cons:  no documentation in the box and no dedicated audio out at all (not even an analog audio out).  Not much product-specific info on the website.      I wanted to use this card for video only, and continue using my existing audio setup.  But when I installed this the sound on my HP a1640n stopped working.  I tried every fix I could think of -- re-installing drivers, disabling them, etc.  I thought the geForce card' software had overwritten or corrupted my motherboard's audio drivers.  After reading many online posts I decided I had to re-install windows and start all over.  I spent a weekend backing up files and re-installing.  It still didn't work.  Eventually I went back to the EVGA site and found a tech support number (blame myself for not doing this *much* earlier).    EVGA has 24/7 free tech support!  After registering the card on the website (required) my call was answered immediately at 10 pm on Sunday night by a knowledgeable person who wasn't just reading a script.  (I think I talked to Doug?  Best tech support call I've had in years).  Problem solved in about 90 seconds (I had to re-boot, go into the BIOS, and set the on-board audio to \\\\\"on\\\\\" (options are off, auto and on).      Had I found the tech support number earlier I would have saved myself a lot of grief.      Bottom line, if you aren't reasonably comfortable mucking around with PC/Windows settings and/or prepared to take a risk, don't try to upgrade a PC with on-board graphics and audio (most mainline consumer PCs fall into this category).  If you are reasonably comfortable, go for it -- but call the company's tech support line if you have any problems.",

The BIGGEST negative is that the rubber on both sides of the case is VERY slick, your expensive new iPad Air could very easily slip out of your hand.

The specs on the single instructions sheet says the AC adapter is rated 22W maximum output, so my guess, as a layperson, is that the speakers output no more than 22W combined.  My old Logitech speaker bar for laptops is rated at 20W, but this Bose set definitely sounds more powerful than the Logitech.<br /><br />There is no lack of volume on these speakers. The instructions recommend you set your PC's volume to 75%; I set the volume on my Toshiba laptop to 50% since this particular model, A665, has a high-quality audio chip. Even when the Bose's volume knob is set to the middle, I get enough sound to fill both my dining room, where I keep the Toshiba, and the adjacent living room!  Pretty impressive.  Of course, these speakers are not small, and they actually feel heavy when I move them around.<br /><br />What I don't quite like is these speakers output too much bass.  It's interesting to note that the first thing you'll see upon opening the box is a small sheet advising you that Bose, founded by an Indian engineer named Bose, does not jack up bass or treble like \\\\\"other speakers.\\\\\" Well, my Logitech has a very neutral sound quality, which makes it suitable for all kinds of audio programs as well as tweaking if I so choose. The Bose, to my ears, has too much bass and forces me to tone down the bass via Windows settings, something I shouldn't have had to do. My husband and I tested the Bose over a large variety of music ranging from classical to heavy metal to Bollywood... Yes, I'm a fan of Bollywood films and music... :) We both agreed there was too much bass...  This can readily cause a headache when you sit so close to the computer and hence these speakers!  My solution is to put them further away from my PC, that option is limited cuz the speaker cords are not too long.  And it definitely does not sound (no pun intended) like Bose putmuch thought into producing a neutral sound like my Logitech or a very compact Sony set, contrary to its marketing claims.<br /><br />Conclusion: this is a good set of PC speakers with tons of volume. If you love bass or are half deaf due to years of listening to loud music, you'll love this set. If you want the best quality of sound, these are not what you're looking for.",

I really didn't want a generic Belkin. On the other hand, I didn't want something clever like a case that looks like an old book. So after reading the reviews and swallowing hard, I plunked down $45 for the case, half of what I paid for a mint HDX (the person did a poor job listing it).<br /><br />I was a little dubious as reviews seemed to be 50-50.<br /><br />I am quite happy with it. The magnets held the HDX right in place and it is great in both horizontal and vertical modes. If I were to have a complaint, and it is picayune, is it doesn't stand well on the glass dining room table. But putting a paper towel under it fixes the problem. The front cover panel itself sticks well, also with magnets. At first you think it is flimsy, but it is quite strong. The origami is clever and once you &#34;get it&#34; (read the insert that says &#34;read first&#34;), you are fine. I am pretty careful with my HDX, though I fling it onto my bed. No problems. I am sure one of these days I will drop it and I am sure it will be fine.<br /><br />You are in for $40 no matter what you do if you get an HDX. I think this product is either up your alley or not at all. No in between. Though I don't know if it is a production error or what, but the people who say the Kindle pops out baffle me. You have to have to strength of Samson to pull it out once it is in.<br /><br />I like mine. Do I recommend it? Well, there aren't too many options out there. Of the choices, I like this best.",

I went all over the net looking for reviews that were not written by the company that made it. After reading about a lot of routers and taking price into consideration, this looked like the best bang for the buck.<br /><br />Once installed I went to several internet speed test sites to try it out. I have Cox as my ISP. I didn\u2019t use the Cox Site for obvious reasons. I did make tests at cox in the past year and my upload was around 12Mbps. Download around 80Mbps. The download speed is not too shabby. Of course I am paying a Premium to get that speed.<br /><br />Now for the Archer C5 tests. I went to three different sites and the results surprised me.<br />Upload averaged around 11Mbps. No surprise there. Download speeds averaged 115Mbps! Now that is fast!  I feel I bought the best router I could in the $75.00 range.<br /><br />The installation was difficult for me. I puttered around for a long time and stopped to read the installation instructions and got lost several times. The install sheet lead me to believe that I had to connect an Ethernet cord from the router to my laptop during install. There are a couple of ways to do the installation and one involved using a mini disk. I have noticed many posts that have a person doing the whole install in 15 minutes! It took me that long to open the box and lay everything out and do an initial read of the instructions. 15 minutes? Yah sure.<br /><br />You won\u2019t be sorry after buying this router.",

There are some drawbacks, however. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the bass isn't very good and it can sound a little tinny, but hey, only 20 bucks, right? It would also be nice if it came with some kind of carrying case, and the suction, while a nice function, won't stick to every kind of phone case, and it's quite likely you'll just pick up your phone to change songs anyway.

The person even sitting next to me in public transportation cannot see what I am viewing.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The product didn't quite fit my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1\\\\\".  I had to cut 3/16\\\\\" of an inch on two sides in order to fit properly and the camera hole to match.  So, if you buy this for the same Samsung tablet, you might want to consider getting your razor blade and straight edge ready.  Perhaps they will correct this since the tablet is a new model that is somewhat recently released (hopefully).<br /><br />The instructions said to peel back a couple of inches of the backing and the start from one end, pushing out all of the bubbles along the way.  The first try was NOT good.  A part of the sheet that you peel off ended up sticking to the screen, although I was careful.  Well, I couldn't have a 1/2\\\\\" area with a bump in the middle of my screen, so I took it off and under the sink and ran some warm water over it and gently scraped it off.  The second try wasn't good either.  Lots of bubbles that seemed next to impossible to get completely out.  The third try, I tried a different application process.  After again thoroughly washing with dish soap and warm water, I kept the soapy water on the adhesive side.  Gently, I positioned the screen on my tablet at the correct location.  Then, going from the center outward, I used my credit card from my wallet (there was no squeegee card included) wrapped it in their soft cloth (included), and pushed the bubbles out.  This worked SO much better.  The bubbles came out much easier and the results were much, much better.<br /><br />My advice to someone who purchases this product to NOT follow their directions as they say.  Just peel off the backing (gently) and try the soapy water trick.  If you don't succeed, you can remove it and try again.  Make sure the tablet is COMPLETELY free from ANY link or dust of any kind.<br /><br />I purchased this product mostly for the privacy feature.  This part works great.  3M claims that it reduces fingerprints.  My opinion is that it doesn't help reduce fingerprints much at all. Perhaps it makes it easier to wipe off, but they will still collect as before.  I think a big part of that is the high gloss texture of the screen.  As far as cutting the glare from the LCD, it works great.  Much less eye strain.<br /><br />As it stands now, my biggest complaint is that I had to cut it in order to fit my particular tablet.  In the end, it all worked out, though.",

Just five bucks that could probably have been refunded if it didn't work. But, surprisingly, it did. I was really quite surprised and quite pleased. I got the adapter just a day before I went backpacking in Europe and I didn't have much faith in it. Go figure, just a few weeks later I was sitting in a bunk in my hut in the Alps uploading and editing photographs with ease. This little device worked perfectly. Well, maybe not perfectly. Often times it says that it's not connected to the iPad when it actually is working just fine. And the construction itself is a little on the cheap side. I'm always afraid of breaking it. But I haven't so far and after a few months of use it's still trucking along. I know some people have given it a 1-star rating but if you approach with this item with the low expectations a five dollar piece of third-party equipment deserves you'll be surprised.

            "input": "I'm an enthusiastic camper and backpacker who loves making campfires, and I also have a wood burning fireplace that I use a lot.<br />Lately I've been looking for a really good 'upgrade' axe or hatchet, both for camping and for splitting smaller logs up to 12-18&#34; for the home fireplace.<br /><br />After a lot of research, I settled on two FISKARS products, this X7 Hatchet and the 28-inch F25 axe. I'm totally pleased. They've exceeded al expectations, and I'm going to review each of them.<br />Other than size, their designs are identical, so everything I'm about to say applies to both the X7 Hatchet and the X25 Axe equally.<br /><br />Long story short, these Fiskars' are really excellent. This is easily the best hatchet I've ever owned, including my Estwing all-steel hatchet and a number of very good vintage hickory-handle hatchets from Plumb and other USA makers.<br />Those are all great cutting tools, but this Fiskars is on a whole different level.<br />It's like comparing a modern Glock polymer .40 semiauto to a 1917 Colt .38 revolver. Both are great, but the newer design clearly outperforms.<br /><br />The Fiskars has a completely hollow handle, which is a huge weight savings. That fiberglass handle is virtually indestructible; the Fiskars website shows a video of a big truck rolling over those handles without any damage.<br />So unlike wooden handles, this one won't break. It's totally immune to understrikes. It's amazing, and if I didn't own these I would have found it hard to believe.<br /><br />And if you do somehow manage to break it, Fiskars has a lifetime warranty. If your Fiskars ever breaks, just email them a photo of the broken tool and they will ship you a replacement for free.<br /><br />Fiskars' blade shape is like a splitting wedge, which is why it splits so well. The angle of the wedge on the hatchet is the same exact angle as on my 28&#34; Fiskars axe.<br />By contrast, most other hatchets (and most axes) use a more knife-like shape which slices in, but does not wedge wood apart very well.<br />The Fiskars does both. It also arrives VERY sharp out of the box, unlike many other brands of hatchet/axe.<br /><br />There are many homemade owner videos and reviews on youTube showing the Fiskars products slicing and splitting BIG logs, often with a single strike. It looks too good to be true, but these are not faked videos. I know because my Fiskars gives the same performance. I'd say 60-70% of the time I can split with one good strike. It's rare to take more than two strikes.<br />The design of the Fiskars is that ergonomic and the wedge shaped blade is that effective.<br /><br />Fiskars uses a relatively soft steel, which means it is more prone to dent or roll on the edge. On the other hand, it's very unlikely to chip.<br />So plan on sharpening your Fiskars periodically, but that should only take a couple of minutes.<br />Fiskars makes a $10 sharpener specifically for their axes and hatchets. I don't own it yet but there are rave reviews on all the blade forums and websites.<br /><br />About the sheath: The Fiskars do not come with traditional sheaths. (I wish they did). Instead they come with a lightweight plastic snap-in holder which protects the blade, but is not designed for belt carry.<br />There's a clever youTube video in which an owner shows his modifications of the factory Fiskars sheath.<br />Basically he cuts off the useless plastic loop at top and drilled 2 sets of 2 holes (4 total), then runs Paracord through the 2 sets of holes to make Paracord belt loops.<br />You could also just cut off that top loop and use the holder as is, either lashed to our pack or inside it.<br /><br />Both the 28&#34; X25 Axe and the 14&#34; X7 hatchet are totally outstanding. There's also a F11 &#34;splitting hatchet&#34; and an F27 36&#34; long &#34;splitting axe&#34; with even more effective wedge shaped blades. I don't own either of these, but the video reviews are impressive and I would recommend checking these out. I chose the X7 for backpacking and light weight, but if weight did not matter and I wanted a 'car camping' or base camp/cabin hatchet, I would have chosen the F11 instead.<br />I found my X25 axe for a giveaway price at a garage sale, but if I were going to buy it again at full retail I would spend the few extra dollars for the 36&#34; F27, even though the X25 I found performs great and does a great job.<br />The 28&#34; X25 works so well I'll probably never be able to justify buying the longer 36&#34; X27.<br /><br />Outstanding products. I totally recommend these, and the price on Amazon (around $25 for the X7 hatchet, around $45 for the X25 axe) is a steal for the quality you get. The X7 hatchet is also available at a lot of Wal-Marts in the camping department, and some WalMarts and all Home Depot's carry the X25 axe at around $45-50. These sometimes go on seasonal sales as well. So there's no need to overpay online.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy trails and safe chopping, everybody.ut.

CMSS 3D beats SRS Circle Surround 2 upsampling (which only provides a mono signal to the surround speakers) easily, and is very competitive (although quite different!) with Dolby Pro Logic II upsampling.<br />However, I have several issues/problems.<br />1) The Audigy doesn't remember the mixer volume settings (eg Master and Wave) across a power up/down cycle of the Audigy hardware.  I really hate having to go in and reset the volume every time I turn the system on.<br />2) I would like to apply CMSS 3D to my radio and other analog signals, but cannot because CMSS 3D does not get applied to &quot;line in&quot; signals, only to Wave signals.<br />3) There is no way to set the speaker distance to compensate for speakers that are at differing distances from the listening position.  Competitor products like the M-Audio Sonica Theatre and stereo receivers have this capability.<br />4) There is no speaker size setting (eg small, medium, large) to ensure proper bass management.  If the surround speakers are small, bass going to them should be routed to the front speakers or subwoofer (if present).  Again, the M-Audio Sonica Theatre has this capability, as do stereo receivers.<br />5) It would be really useful to have VU meters for input and output (all channels) built into the driver.

Apps is pretty decent although it does not offer as much as Apple or Android  it is still a great selection but does not seem to update to new apps very often, reading books is great, Comics even better. Watching a video on here is stunning with the quality of the graphics and the amazing sound and no problems with lagging, I love it overall.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like is the Amazon Prime I have a membership since I am a student it is discounted or I probably would have cancled it by now. It seems as they never add very many new movies or tv shows and when they do they are way outdated every once in a while they load some great ones on the Prime but do not expect to be amazed by the selection of movies or tv shows especially after you have watched the majority of them and are left with the really bad ones that put you to sleep in 10 minuets.<br /><br />The lending library is awesome I enjoy the ability to borrow one book each month the selection is great and you do not return until you are done with it! This is the best part of the Prime membership. I am a simple person and this is a great device for me, not complicated but advanced enough to keep you intrested.<br /><br />The battery does not last as long as they say it does unless you keep it in sleep mode and barely use it but it still has an amazing battery life I cannot complain about it at all, turn the brightness down your eyes will adjust and you will save some battery and also kill your apps when not in use to help extend the battery.<br /><br />The internet browser (Silk I think it is called) Is amazingly fast in speed, but you cannot watch allot of video content on websites which is a downfall. But definetly faster than most browsers out there.<br /><br />Well I don't know anything else to say except for the price I do not think you can beat the Kindle Fire HD. It was actually a gift so even better for me! I would recomend this product I believe you will enjoy it very much. Some reason people think it is not bluetooth compatable which is false for mine anyway it does have bluetooth so you can use a wireless keyboard on it.<br /><br />Oh and the antiglare is ok but if the sun comes through a window when watching a movie you will probably have to move if you want to enjoy the movie. Okay I think I am done now so the only downfall I really have is not with the device but with them not adding very much to the Prime movies hopefully it will get better.<br /><br />I am no expert on reviews or testing devices I just thought I would recomend this after using it since Christmas being very impressed by it overall.",

There is a push button switch (N/O) for taking stills that can be snipped off as well.  Keep in mind that it is a 5 volt Cam and exceeding that will fry this Cam!  The little fold out ring on the base allows you to hang the Cam on the top of your monitor. Some reviewers seemed to wish that this unit had IR LED's thankfully that is not the case since this unit is to be pointed at your face. Recent research has shown that IR light directed into the eyes can lead to cataracts!

Going to attempt RMA and ask for newer revision and, if that won't fly, going to consider something from Plantronics, Astro or Sennheiser.  In Skyrim, Counter Strike, Metro: Last Light and Battlefield 3, after a period ranging from fifteen minutes to several hours, the sound channels just suddenly reverse.  Everything's fine... then boom, jacked.  Sounds from the left are now in my right ear and vice-versa.  Corsair has no idea what causes this (it's C-Media software or on-board USB soundcard, my guess), there is no fix (last C-Media update is several YEARS old), but hey, the warranty is good so I appreciate that from them.<br /><br />This sucks, really, because Corsair is a respectable corp. with tons of goodwill from gamers and has other product lines which are somewhat strong.  I really wanted to like these and do enjoy the larger speaker drivers (not to be confused with software), comfort and build quality.  This issue, though, strikes many users, without warning, and it's not an issue with USB or Windows.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />I'll update here with a status on RMA.",

In fact, he tried to reach me earlier, but I did not check the feedback box when I placed my order to permit this. So, he sent an email to everyone from the last thirty days with my posting name hoping he would obtain the purchase information. Once I responded, he then called me almost immediately. Rick strongly expressed his regret that I had a bad experience, but stated that because the case is hand stitched, the magnets were probably placed slightly out of position. Plus, he said this was only the second time a defect of this type occurred in the history of the product. Since we talked on a Friday evening, he then told me a new case would be shipped via overnight delivery the following Monday. After receiving it and examining all of the features, I now love it. The fit and appearance are great, it functions as advertised, so now I would highly recommend buying this case.<br /><br />To say I was impressed with Rick and the manner in which the situation was rectified to my complete satisfaction is an understatement.

The Sandy bridge second generation Intel I5 quadcore processor is very impressive and i'm also running 16gb of ram so it's very fast. The 1.5TB hardrive is just overkill for me considering i already have a 3TB external drive, but it's a good overkill, it gives me more space than i know what to do with because the 1.5TB alone is massive. The hardrive speed isn't the quickest but it's no where near slow enough to even notice or complain about because it works great. There's enough PCI-E slots to allow upgrades to make up for anything this computer lacks. Although this thing is covered in usb 2.0's, there are no 3.0's, which would have been a problem but i picked up a PCI-E card to fix that. It could also have a Blu-Ray drive but it's really not a big deal and if you want one you can add it whenever. There is a tray on the top of the computer which is awesome if you have ipods, phones, or any other accessories plugged in on a regular basis as they just sit on top along with their usb ports. When this computer is turned on it really shines, no pun intended. The outline of the computer lights up with a bright aesthetic glow which surprised me because aside from powerful i didn't expect this computer to look half as good as it does. Don't worry though, the lights can be turned off via a button on top. The disc tray opens from a button on the right side of the computer so don't freak out and think the disc tray is broken, it's just too rad to comprehend, like the rest of this computer. The motherboard reads Acer for all of those who hate Gateways. Gateway is now Acer. So basically you get the awesome Gateway logo lighten up (which was always the best part of Gateway) with Acer power. If you want to do high graphic gaming, i would get a Video card, but you will be limited as the power supply for this computer isn't too large. Honestly though, the onboard HD graphics are awesome and can run any game i've played thus far on high graphics. Age of Empires 3 for example, runs great on high graphics! So unless you're some hardcore gaming maniac (if which case you shouldn't even be reading this because it's under 10 billion dollars and probably only a little worse than a what you're looking for anyway) you should be fine. There's also HDMI, and you can run HDMI and VGA to have dual-monitors, which is what i do. In conclusion, this computer is a very cheap way of bringing yourself into the next generation of computing. Great purchase.he onboard HD graphics are awesome and can run any game i've played thus far on high graphics. Age of Empires 3 for example, runs great on high graphics!

I had recently decommissioned a Compaq laptop that I had been delighted with. It lasted six years. I had used other HP products and was a loyal customer, based on their performance.     The desktop was trouble from the start. I complained to customer service the day the warrantee ran out, and they would not honor it.     Soon thereafter, the machine became too slow to use despite Norton's then version of what is currently 360. HP customer service was extremely polite but totally incompetent. It was mostly Indian in India, but the problem wasn't language. They didn't know what they were doing. slowness was maddening. Their highest level tech told me to recover the main drive. I had backed up the drive using the HP utility, according to instructions. Although I am no geek, it appeared they had superimposed their logo on IBM's backup system. After recovery, the backup restoration did not work due to some problem with their software. With the help of an outside vendor recommended by HP, Omnitech, which charged me $200 for a year's service, I was able to get access to my files, although the directory structure and access had been damaged by the HP backup/restore system.     The slowness crept back after the year, during which Omnitech personnel had regular access to my commputer to keep it running at a reasonable speed. This invasion of privacy at a yearly cost 30% of the computer was not welcome, though necessary.     After the contract ran out, the slowness returned. I complained to HP and pushed it up the corporate ladder. Eventually, I reached the CHIEF of the pc division, who told me that since the unit was out of warrantee, he would do nothing to help me.     I resolved at that moment never, ever to purchase another HP product again. I am writing this review to notify potential victims of their customer service that if service is an important factor in your purchase, you ought to consider another company on that basis.",

As a gamer, I demand a lot out of my hardware, and this CPU has never failed to meet those demands.  I upgraded from a dual core 3.4ghz Intel, and although this runs at 3.2, loosing the front side bus was totally worth it.  My former CPU transferred data between cores at 800mhz, so no matter how fast I clocked it, there was latency built into the chip.  By building the host memory controller for the cores into the CPU, Intel was able to speed up performance significantly.  I went from a barley playable flight simulator x to one that ran smooth.  Although there are few programs that utilize four cores, having them available insures that computing will remain smooth for a while to come.  The CPU will shut down inactive cores, and boost the remaining cores internally by a percentage.  It will also ramp down the CPU if the needs are fewer than that available.  Having the Extreme version of this chip, means the core multiplier is unlocked, and the speed is really only held back by the available power, and cooling in the computer.  I have overclocked my machine to 4ghz stable.  I would recommend purchasing a third party cooler, and getting good thermal paste when purchasing this CPU as it runs hot.  I use the Chilltec thermal-electric cooler.  It combines a heat pipe, and pellitier solution that is better than most water systems, without introducing water into the case.

Called Amazon yesterday, filed an A to Z claim (basically an investigation on Amazons end), JUST got an email from the seller saying they were out of stock due to Christmas orders, they apologized and refunded my money... I'm now sitting here, awaiting a refund and still no case. My big thing is now is if you had run out of stock, jump on your website and update it! Don't pull a bait and switch! Obviously they KNEW they were out, still proceeded to take my money, give me a FAKE tracking number, and led me on until AFTER the holidays. So like I had promised, I will NOT be removing my bad review. Once again, avoid business with these fakes!",

This was not case with desktops or with the Lenovo 410 laptop I tested with the docking station, so I believe it is just a quirk with the laptop (or even Windows 8) and not a problem with the UD-3900. I have the UD-3900 output (2 USB ports and the DVI port) connected to a USB-based KVM, and it works perfectly.

The UD-3900 is compact and looks sleek is sitting neatly on the corner of my desk. Using it takes up less space than my two old docking stations made for my laptop models. I compared a lot of features among several universal docking stations and opted to purchase the UD-3900 although it was not the cheapest vs. a couple others, but I can tell you it is worth every penny. The UD-3900 is easy to setup and use with any system that has a USB 3.0 port available to connect up to the UD-3900. It does not make any noise and does not appear to produce any heat.

Not to mention there was no programming involved.<br /><br />TLDR; pros: it's a great kit for getting started; one of the less expensive starter kits with a lot of value; up and running in minutes<br />cons: the book is too small for reading (I think there's a pdf on the disc but I don't have an optical drive; the company website doesn't exist; you'll lose a lot of sleep tinkering with circuits<br /><br />I've heard good things about the Arduino as a great tool for learning electronics and finally decided to jump on the bandwagon when my daughters expressed interest in learning how to program. I want to make it fun for them and fun for me at the same time. I did research on Arduino vs Raspberry PI and came to the conclusion that while the Raspberry PI is a very interesting device, it's higher level than where I wanted to start. So I look through several offerings and land on the Sunfounder Super Starter Kit Uno (in retrospect I should have gotten the Mega but I didn't realize what the difference between the two are).<br /><br />When the package came in the mail, I couldn't wait to get home and try it out. I also purchased [[ASIN:&#34;1118549368&#34; Exploring Arduino]] as a learning guide. After going through the first three chapters of the book and making the projects, I looked at the clock and realized it was 3AM.<br /><br />From making the onboard LED blink to creating my first circuit to make an led on a breadboard blink, I came to the realization that electronics isn't the boogie man I've made it out to be in my mind. In fact as a programmer, I have a leg up. I'm used to working with components that when I send it input X, I get result y. Now instead of just being confined to the digital world, I can make software that controls physical objects.<br /><br />And there are so many physical objects to control. You can buy a touch sensitive screen for 35 dollars and build your own digital universal remote. Or get a bluetooth module for 15 and communicate with your smart phone.

            "input": "In a nutshell:  A cheap, competent wireless keyboard that excels in HTPC work.  Some quibbles and questionable build quality hold it back.<br /><br />Background:  I have come across this keyboard multiple times.  I initially bought the keyboard for the home HTPC, which played nicely with the computer it was hooked up to.  After that, we decided to roll it out to the use for a startup company I am working for.<br /><br />What it is:  It's a tenkeyless (meaning, no number pads on right side of keyboard) keyboard, with touchpad on the right side of the keyboard, all the function keys are small, and some additional keys on the top left corner.  On the very top left is the secondary left mouse button; it comes in surprisingly handy.  The keys are slightly smaller than your regular keyboard--think Eee PC (netbook) keyboards.<br /><br />Pros:  Logitech hit the sweet spot for the no-frills HTPC keyboard.  Using the touchpad while holding it with your hand is as natural as you can make it; you move your cursor with the right thumb, while left clicking with your left thumb over the secondary left click button.  It's light.  Keeping multiple keyboards of the same kind in relative proximity is no problem, as well; they don't seem to interfere each other's signals.  They keystroke is adequate, although it's no mechanical keyboard.  Think budget laptop keyboard.  On/off toggle is present and relatively easy to find.  The keyboard regularly hits $29.99 or less; great value for money.<br /><br />Cons:  Right shift key has shrunk (which is no problem on its own) and was placed on the right side of the up key.  That makes it very hard to type naturally.  Shrunk keyboard takes some getting used to for typing quickly.  The lightness of the keyboard actually gets in the way for typing from the lap.  There's no backlight--but you shouldn't expect it with a budget HTPC keyboard.  Lack of right mouse button on the upper left corner of the keyboard is a missed chance; it would have been infinitely more convenient with it.  Build quality is questionable; it flexes very easily.<br /><br />In conclusion:  It's no home run, but it's probably the best HTPC keyboard I have used so far.  Just don't try to do heavy typing work on it.",

            "input": "I've always been a desktop type person. I few months back I tried an Asus 15.6 laptop with an Intel Celeron 1007u, 4 GB memory, and 320 GB HD. I returned that device and didn't think of getting another laptop. I then saw this and was interested on purchasing it for it's low price($299.99 at Best Buy). Some of my comments will be comparing it to that Asus.<br /><br />Here are some of my comments:<br />- The build quality is pretty decent. When I first got it, the lid would occasionally creak as I opened it. It seems to have gone away now. The keyboard area is also very sturdy. This area doesn't bend as you type as you might find on other cheap laptops. The lid seems to be a huge dust magnet though for some reason.<br /><br />- The screen is ok. It could be better. The viewing angles are ok, much better than the Asus'. In a room with a window on the ceiling, the screen was very hard to see even on maximum brightness. I could only see the screen if I went to a darker part of the room.<br /><br />- Processor = It's meant for battery life(it's supposed to be a tablet processor). It could handle most things without a problem. Videos were not playable while on AMD's Power Save Mode(which makes it run at about .6 GHz per core). With the base clock of about 1 GHz, videos loaded ok, but were sometimes jumpy. I could play games such as World of Wacraft and Simcity on lower settings and low fps. WOW had FPS of about 15-30 with 1366x768 resolution and just a few settings above the lowest. This processor features Turbo Dock mode. Turbo Dock is meant to activate when you put a tablet onto its dock. Since this is a laptop, it only activates when plugged in unless I'm doing something wrong. Turbo dock makes the max clock at 1.4 GHz and the power save clock at maybe .7 GHz(can't remember the exact number). This makes video playback a lot smoother.<br /><br />- Memory = Good enough for basic things. The system only uses about 1.8 GB in most cases.<br /><br />- Fan = This thing is pretty loud. It's dead silent usually when the processor is clocked lower, but when watching video on basic clock speeds, it'll get a little loud.<br /><br />- Hard Drive = Mine came with a Western Digital Blue drive. It's not the fastest out there, but it gets the job done. I must say though, this drive is incredibly quite. I can barely hear it and it's only a small sound when under full loud. The fan usually drowns out the hard drive sound.<br /><br />- Graphics = See processor.<br /><br />- Keyboard = Going from a full size desktop keyboard to a keyboard of a 11.6 laptop is rough. I think the keys were pretty comfortable though and are decent enough.<br /><br />- Trackpad = Here is where it goes bad. The trackpad randomly becomes possessed. It will once and awhile refuse to tap click anything unless you tap it rapidly. It will also go all over the place as you try to move around. This is supposedly common across all forms of this laptop and there's a large thread about it(I think on the Dell forums). There doesn't seem to be a fix yet. It can be fine for hours and then one minute later go crazy. However, it's a smooth surface to rest your fingers on.<br /><br />- Touchscreen = Very responsive and doesn't commonly miss any touches. I usually end up using it whenever the trackpad decides to not work right.<br /><br />- Speakers = I don't know much about how loud laptops get, but this gets pretty loud in my opinion. It can get a little distorted near higher volumes. Music sounds good, but watching any videos with just regular talking sound a little odd off the laptop's speakers. They sound a little echo-y.<br /><br />- Battery = The battery + the processor equals long battery life. Depending on the settings and what I'm doing I can get about 6-12 hours off a charge. The 3 cell 50 WHr battery is pretty big compared to what you usually find on 11.6 budget laptops. Charges up pretty quickly.<br /><br />Update:<br />- I forgot to talk about the webcam. I haven't used it much at all, but it's \\\\\"ok\\\\\" and it's as expected on a budget laptop.<br />- I also forgot to mention how this laptop comes with a low amount of bloatware. It only contains dell specific software from what I saw.<br /><br />Feel free to comment on anything I may have missed or any questions you may have that I might be able to answer.",

Currently, I am using an EA3500 which was installed on Jan 28, 2014.  It worked well for about three months and then it started having the same problem as the prior three routers.  It starts dropping you and at first, you reboot your PC and it works again (for a while).  Start a spreadsheet of the date, time, what YOU did to correct it, whether you called Linksys, Name or ID of whom you spoke to at Linksys - add a column for what THEY had you do to resolve it.  Once you realize you are doing this on a every other or daily basis you call Linksys.  First they tell you it must be your ISP - Internet Services Provider (Cox, Verizon, AT&T, etc.), so you hang up and call your cable or other provider and if they don't tell you - ask them how many days your internet has been connected in a row.  You call Linksys back and they tell you that you need to have a computer directly connected to it with a RJ-45 or Ethernet cord. (so much for owning a laptop to use wirelessly).  You connect your PC to the router so now you should be able to get onto the internet.  They immediately tell you that your software must need an update.  They get you signed into their Smart WiFi site and they run an update for the software even if you don't need it.  You will Never see them run the  &#34;is my software up to date&#34;  button because then they might have to look further and do more than an update.  After they run the software they always changed the channels your router is using and tell you that will fix it.  And it does, for about a week. When it starts again, you think about having to bring your PC to where your router is located and sitting there while they try to correct the problem. So - you Google the problem - and you discover that Windows 8 has a new piece of software that resets your router adapter for you which corrects the problem.  You start using this nifty tool andyou think, this isn't so bad, at least I have a network connection.  After a while you realize the problem is persisting and your little fix isn't working all the time.  That is when you start going to the router and unplugging it and plugging it back in again.  Add every little thing you do to your spreadsheet.  For some reason resetting your router and at times your modem seems to work well and you think, its fixed - I solved it.  You get into a project and you are spending a lot of time on your computer and it starts again.  Now it happens when you use your computer for more than checking your email and calendar. You call Linksys and they update the software and change the channel a few more times.  Then out of frustration you go to the library to do work or anywhere they have a free network.  The seasons have changed and getting out isn't so bad.. then one day - you say I've had it and you call Linksys and tell them you can't stand the problems with this router.  The are very polite and tell you that you have only called 7 times in the entire year so it doesn't qualify as a recurrent problem and oh by the way  - your warranty expired.  But they are happy to sell you a new router, a better one - SAY _ NO Thank you and Run to the nearest real store to buy a different brand.  I wish I had... j",

            "input": "This is my third livescribe pen.  I have thought with each iteration that the company has improved their product.  This one has some features I really like, but it also currently needs a product running iOs7 to get the full benefit from the app.  In other words you need a iPhone 4S or higher, iPad 3rd generation or higher, iPad mini 1st Gen or higher or an iPod touch 5th gen or higher.  Android support is supposed to arrive this year but no ETA is announced-- which is an annoyance to me since I switched from my iPhone 4S to an Android phone a few weeks ago. So I'll be back to using my Livescribe Sky or Echo<br /><br /> until the Android app makes its appearance.<br /><br />The pen pairs with your iThing running the app via bluetooth.  The audio recording is done through the microphone on your iThing. This is a really big con for me right now, although when I had my iPhone I did find that the recorded audio was superior to the audio recorded on my Sky and Echo.  I like the style better.  It looks more like a real pen than the prior versions.  It's round all the way to the top with a pocket clip to make it more secure to store in a pocket.  The top of the pen (opposite the pen point) acts as a stylus.  The worse problem I had was getting the removeable stylus tip off in order to charge the pen with the microUSB cable charger cable.  The instruction booklet was pretty much no help and I ended up going to the support part of the company web site and searching for information.  The cap is on good and tight, which is a plus.  The pen point has a rubberized covering that I like better than the hard plastic one on my other two Smart pens.  At least I haven't lost it yet.<br /><br />The pen turns on with a twist of the ring in the middle of the pen which also extends the pen point.  Twist the other way and the pen point retracts and the pen turns off.  This is the feature I like the best.<br /><br />This kit comes with everything needed to get started including a rather nice black leather portfolio and a notebook with the special paper you need.  It's important to remember that these gadgets are great for specific purposes, but the accessories and supplies are not cheap.  I tend to buy Livescribe branded refills, paper and parts.  The paper I think can be printed with a sufficiently high grade printer, but I've never thought it worth my time.  Also, if you have notebooks that were designed to work with one of the earlier pens you will find that you can use them with the Livescribe 3 as well.<br /><br />One word of caution.  This is a recording device and depending on where you are when you are recording, there are laws about privacy or even wiretapping.  Check the laws of your state and remember that if a telephone is involved then you may fall under federal requirements.  It's best to get everyone's permission although federal law in the US only requires that one party consents.  If you are recording in certain states then all of the parties must consent.<br /><br />So I really like this version of the Smart Pen and I am looking forward to the Android app.black leather portfolio and a notebook with the special paper you need.

I will start with the two worst features, which in my opinion also happen to be the most important. The sound, my god, these sound bad. Shrill and harsh through the entire reproduced frequency, and as unlikely as it seems, the sound is the most restricted, dull and lifeless out of all the headphones I have listened to, ever. Unlikely to have a small and restricted soundstage? well, with the large 50mm drivers the corsairs are touted as having, I expected a bit more, but got quite a bit less. I dont know how its possible, but these even sound worse than the turtle beach x11's and thats no small feat. At least the turtle beach headphones sound loud, reasonably clear, and open. I could understand how the headphone neophyte might believe the turtle beaches to sound good, there is no doubt with the corsair, these just dont sound good.        These are the heaviest headphones I have ever strapped on my head, even heavier than the already heavy x11's. And, finally these are head clamps, the corsairs relentlessly squeeze your head until blood vessels swell and pop in your eyes. There's really no need to go on with the additional features. I'm really doubting the integrity of the reviews, i see some of the reviews are for the corsair usb headphones, but the manufacturer claims they both have the same drivers. I watched all the videos posted by corsair before I made the purchase, and I bought into what was being said. I feel like a fool, spending 80.00 on something this bad, these headphones aren't just bad for the price, these are bad for any price. This was such an egregious purchase, it made me rethink everything. I spent a high end price for something that was quickly thrown together in china by the lowest contract bidder. I realize its next to impossible to avoid Chinese manufactured products, but these corsair headphones seem to embody absolutely everything that is wrong, andcould go wrong with that process. Its as if these headphones slapped me in the face and said \\\\\"got you\\\\\", then while I was still stunned, it told me your whats wrong with america, you created this economy, you did this.",

The reason for this is due to the hexagonal catch that locks the scroll wheel into the receiver is made of a cheap rigid plastic that breaks instead of bends when put under enough pressure. The only reason why I still recommend this mouse despite this issue is because the problem is easily fixed. Luckily the wheel can be easily replaced with most mouse wheels, so if you have an old or broken optical mouse just break it open and swap out the wheels.<br /><br />If you want to replace the mouse wheel or fix any part of the mouse here is what you do.<br /><br />1) First remove Mazer sticker and the 4 plastic padding underneath the mouse. The screws are hidden beneath them.<br /><br />2) Remove the  screws and place them in a container (they are small and easily lost)<br /><br />3) Carefully remove the top of the mouse, there are unfastened parts that can easily fall out and be lost<br /><br />4) Carefully remove the top circuit board from the bottom one, there is a jack (or two, don't remember) connecting the two together. Make sure you remove it without yanking out the port.<br /><br />5) Remove the broken mouse wheel and replace it with the new one by sliding in the hexagonal piece into the catch, this may require some maneuvering to slide it into place, just make sure you do not bend or break the port.<br /><br />6) after everything is done, put it all back together remembering the unfastened pieces if they managed to fall out.<br /><br />If people need further help with fixing this mouse, I may make a video.",

            "input": "I have been a happy Kindle user since the Kindle 2, but after using the Touch for a few years, it was time for an upgrade. I read through the reviews, not sure whether to upgrade to the Voyage or the Paperwhite. My husband has the newest Paperwhite. He's very satisfied with it, and I knew it would be a big upgrade. So the question I needed to settle was whether or not the difference between the Paperwhite and the Voyage would be worth it for me.<br /><br />I read through multiple reviews and decided on the Voyage. I couldn't be happier with my choice! If you're thinking about this, don't hesitate.<br /><br />Here's what I like and some of my observations regarding common criticisms:<br />________<br />Display<br />With its 300 dpi resolution, the Kindle Voyage's text display is crisp and clear. Compared side-by-side with the Paperwhite, I can see the difference. Reading on the Kindle Voyage a pleasure, as there are no blurred edges in the text display.<br /><br />The screen of the Kindle Voyage is smooth and silky in contrast with the screen of the Paperwhite and Touch, both of which feel slightly pebbled. This textured surface was less pleasing to the touch than the new smooth Voyage surface.<br />________<br />Screen lighting<br />I see no evidence of the &#34;two-toned screen&#34; display that other users have cited. Again, compared side-by-side with the Paperwhite, I am pleased with the even tone and &#34;whiteness&#34; of the screen display. I especially like the Auto Brightness function of the Voyage, which is an improvement over the Paperwhite. With the Paperwhite, I notice that my husband keeps his lighting fairly constant and it always appears too bright to me. With the Auto Brightness function turned on, my Kindle Voyage adjusts to the ambient lighting, maintaining a relatively constant screen tone that is neither too bright nor too dim. It is worth noting that you have to turn the Auto Brightness option on under the lighting display, as the default option is manual control.<br />________<br />Flush bezel<br />Amazon continues to refine the design of the Kindle, and the Voyage has undergone some welcome physical changes. In addition to being the lightest and thinnest Kindle to date, the bezel, or frame around the reading screen, is perfectly flush with the reading surface. I am a fan of a clean screen, and with this new design, there are no corners for dust inevitably to settle in to.<br />________<br />PagePress<br />Hallelujah! I'm thrilled to have touch sensors on the frame that allow me to turn pages with the press of a thumb. I tend to read one-handed with the Kindle held lightly along the edges. With the Touch, I adjusted to read with the Kindle balanced in two hands so that one thumb was free to swipe the surface display and turn the page. Now with the Voyage, I can read with the Kindle in one hand and press gently to turn the page forward or back. The surface is still there, but I find myself turning pages with the touch sensors almost exclusively. Both the pressure needed to to turn a page using PagePress and the haptic response (vibration feedback) that the user gets to acknowledge the page turn can be adjusted under Settings. The default setting for both is Medium. I adjusted both my pressure and feedback settings to Low. The feedback setting can be turned off with PagePress still enabled.<br />________<br />GoodReads integration<br />The Amazon site, GoodReads, is integrated with the newest Kindles. My hope is that this will make it easier for me to get good book recommendations! This is a feature of the Paperwhite as well.<br />________<br />PageFlip<br />Again, this is a feature of the Paperwhite, but it wasn't part of my reading experience with the Touch. When reading a book, you can swipe up from the bottom of the page and scan forward and back in the text without losing your place. I appreciate this, as I tend to rescan the text to check a detail . With older Kindle models, I had to skip back or forward and count page turns or recall a significant text string and use the search feature if I had not previously marked a passage. Overall, this feature makes it easier to interact with a text.<br />________<br />Speed<br />Last, but not least, I should note the processing speed difference between the Voyage and the Touch. Using my old Touch, book download speeds were fine, but if I wanted to navigate the Kindle store, I could feel myself growing old and impatient as I waited for a page refresh. When I wanted a new book, I always avoided the Kindle WiFi and went to my laptop, turning the WiFi on on my Kindle only when I was ready to download a new book. The difference in speed between my old Touch and my husband's new Paperwhite was one of the factors that made me commit to an upgrade. With the Voyage (and with the Paperwhite), using WiFi and navigating the Kindle store is no longer painful.ard and count page turns or recall a significant text string and use the search feature if I had not previously marked a passage.

If this is your first use of Windows 8 give yourself plenty of time to get used to how completely different it is.  There is an option in the appearance settings to use a Windows 7-like visual format, but the inner workings are not the same as in the past.  I like the look of the computer, the speakers give very full sound, very clear even at lower volume.  The keyboard, wire notwithstanding, is very pleasant to use. The keys are a nice size, and very smooth.  I would like a larger mouse, but this one works well.  This is a good deal for a desk computer, just be sure to allow yourself time for set-up and acclimation.",

I don't want to come off here like money doesn't matter, it does. This was really a right price!<br />After a few days (shipping did not come from Amazon Prime) I got an email from Roo that they had become aware of an issue with the auto sleep/wake feature not working properly and a fix was on the way. Then they proceed to say that the original case was in route and that I should keep it at no charge and they would be shipping the replacement very soon.

I suspected the PSU, but plugged the tower into a different UPS just to clear the possibility of an external issue first.  The tower continued to shut off at random times.  Eventually it got to the point that the tower would shut off within minutes of being turned on.<br /><br />The fan wasn't coming on with startup, but that isn't unusual for this PSU since it employs an &#34;on demand&#34; fan, however the PSU felt cool to the touch after each failure so I doubted that it was overheating.  Rail voltages were within tolerances so it wasn't being shut down by a watchdog circuit, unless the watchdog was faulty.<br /><br />I swapped out the PSU with an old BFG 500 watt that I had on the shelves and the tower once again ran stable, not shutting down even after several days.  With the culprit almost certainly being the RM650, I called Corsair Tech Support.  My wait time wasn't overly long and the tech walked me through the steps that I had already completed before he reached the same conclusion I had, namely that the PSU was faulty.  He recommended that I use the Corsair Web site to RMA the unit, which I did.  I just shipped the PSU, so I'll update as the process moves along.<br /><br />I was going to 3 star the PSU for now, since it did fail on me in a very short time, but I don't like paying for shipping a heavy PSU back to the manufacturer when it failed through no fault of my own.

It converted and processed videos like a beast and I could also run minecraft without any dip in frame rate or quality. It did what I needed it to do for a little over a year. Then it blue screened upon start up every single time. The hardware failed and I could not get it up and running again. The computer was done and left me in a tough spot. I had to run out and buy a new computer which I should have done in the first place. The computer is what it is.. It's as fast as a whip and has beastly processing power, but it died on me. Take it as you will. It's cheap and got the job done for awhile. Would I get it again? Probably not, but for 100 bucks, it lasted a good year so I say meh.

If you absolutely need built-in speakers then either look for a different monitor or accept the fact that you'll have sub-par sound.",

I can\u2019t tell you how it\u2019s improved her quality of life with being able to Skype with me and my sister, her grandchildren and being able to see and speak with her great-grandchildren.  It really only took me 2 half days to get her set up and comfortable with getting emails and using Skype.  I tried to introduce her to the games and she was on overload so I didn\u2019t pursue.  Within a week, she told me how she got into Solitaire and how it helps her pass the time when she is waiting for someone \u2013 She did that all on her own.  We all send her pictures from our phones as well as video\u2019s.  She loves walking by the Telekin and seeing that she has emails especially when they contain pictures of the great grandchildren.  Previous to this we had to call her to tell her we sent her pictures, she had to go down to a computer room and access them.  The computers were set up for security reasons \u2013 not to be able to see video\u2019s.  She was missing so much.<br /><br />We set the Telekin up in her bedroom on her desk.  Now I call her and ask her if she wants to Skype and the answer is always YES!  I get to see her and can access how she\u2019s doing much better by seeing her on Skype.  Sounds kind of funny, but I think she also likes to see my smiling face as well as my wife's too!<br /><br />Thanks again for all of your help and for developing such a great product!<br /><br />Should you ever need a testimonial or wish to use any of the above, feel free.  It was the best investment we could have made in our mother.  We\u2019re heading back up there in later this August so round 2 of training is forthcoming.<br /><br />Thanks again for helping me with this.  I can\u2019t say enough about it.",

The primary difference here is that when you install it in the Sony VAIO TXN27N, you have to install it FACE DOWN (port down). The original Toshiba MK1011GAH is installed port side up. I thought the device was incompatible initially because nothing happened when I initially detected. After flipping it around, all's well. Another note, the device is VERY small (about a 1/3 smaller than the 1.8&#34; HDD). It's slightly larger than the mSATA drive, so you'll need to figure out a way to keep it from moving around too much and detaching itself, so I used a thermal pad strip to &#34;glue&#34; it in place.",

I have never had performance issues, even when playing intensive games like MMOs.<br /><br />I also found myself using it much like a tablet, which was rather unexpected.  Windows 8 is actually a brilliant software when you use it on this device (I've never used it on a desktop with mouse, so I can't comment on that).  It's touch-intuitive and the movements just *make sense* rather than being based around someone thinking they need to throw in touch because it's the newest cool thing.<br /><br />The touch responsiveness is great, and I really, really, REALLY like the stylus to take notes and draw using Illustrator (well, my free version of it: Inkscape).  I feel like I'm writing on paper, but paper that can magically re-write my handwriting as typed text (note: you will need a paid version of OneNote for that feature).<br /><br />I haven't had any battery life issues or sleeps of death that I've seen other people talk about.  I guess I'm lucky.  When I play my games, it does need to be plugged in, but otherwise I can get upwards of 8 hours of use out of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would heartily recommend this device for anyone looking to get rid of a laptop and maybe downsize.

After spending about 20 minutes shopping at the Kindle store, I was unable to download the selection because there was not enough power left in the battery.  This, after starting out with the battery fully charged.  Okay, I thought, I'll just use the USB cable and download e-books from my computer.  After hooking up my Kindle to the computer I received a message to the effect that if I wanted to use my Kindle or continue charging, to disconnect it from my computer!  No other options offered.  Actually, I would have preferred to just use the USB cable and shop from my computer.  However, I could not find anywhere in the user manual that says how to do this.  There has been too much hype about the WiFi capability without consideration for people  who live in areas of low signal strength.  If there was information available in the user manual regarding downloading with the USB cable, it certainly was not where it could easily be found.  All I could find was information on how to use a wi-fi option.  Also, lots of luck trying to get tech support.  I would probably order another Kindle if someone would just make it plain to me how to download e-books without having to use the wi-fi option.<br /><br />Rob Danis<br /><br />Follow up review; 1/4/13<br /><br />I'd forgotten about this review, and wish I had remembered it sooner.

In terms of sound they have very crisp highs, very deep and punchy bass, and the mid-range is not lost. I've never felt the need to adjust them, they seem quite well balanced. If anything, they are a little heavy on the bass but noticeably so, which for their design is an impressive feat on itself.<br /><br />The control wheel gives you a nice analog feel with a good amount of control, but you might find yourself accidentally muting the volume when reaching for it, which is the only thing I find annoying.<br /><br />They sound very clear at low volume and you only notice artifacts on max volume when you want to fill the entire floor of your home with sound and rock out.

            "input": "Years ago, I bought a Logitech thumb trackball of some unknown model name when I bought my very first computer. I remember that I was really enjoying using it until a friend stopped by to visit after school, and chided me for not having a regular mouse. I realize, today, that that friend of mine was an idiot.<br />  I have several wireless mice I use with my netbook for school, and they were helpful when I would take the computer to a coffee shop or to school to do some work. But I leave the house less for these purposes, and instead work on a tiny non-computer desk with approximately zero space to maneuver a mouse. I then recalled the trackball of yore and sought one out.<br /><br />  There are several on the market now, and Logitech and Kensington seem to be the main players (which is a shame - trackballs really are great). I initially tried the [[ASIN:B0043T7FXE Logitech M570  Wireless Trackball]]. It had its good points: laser tracking, unifying receiver, quite comfortable for right-handed people. I found, however, that when compared to the Marble, I much preferred the trackball to actually be in the center so that it can be controlled with my index and middle fingers. By comparison, the thumb-control style felt much less precise and efficient. And this may have had more to do with my thumb itself than with the device. Another plus for the Marble is that the actual ball itself is of a larger diameter than the smallish M570. Personally, I think it allows for more economy of motion and a surer 'grip' if you will while navigating.<br /><br />  The Marble is also quite comfortable to use - my hand just lounges across the top of it, and I can click and move effortlessly (well, almost effortlessly, but I'll get to that part soon). And when I first realized the Marble used optical tracking, it sounded like I was taking a step back in time. No worries - for general usage, it is extremely precise and I've read that some people enjoy playing FPS games with this model. My needs are less strenuous than that, though, so I cannot attest to the Marble's efficacy there. And, since it stays at home, the USB cord is just fine by me - I save on batteries. The entire device is very stable on the old, polished wooden desk I 'appropriated' for my work space; it does not slide around or wobble back and forth. It is quite steady.<br /><br />  I suppose it is the nature of things to not be all perfect, and the Marble is not and thus I took off a star. If you have read this far (thank you!), then perhaps you have enough interest in this trackball to already know it is ambidextrous. This is both a blessing and a curse. Many 'thumb' models require you to be right-handed, which is too bad. However, this model can be easily placed on either side of your work space and accomadate whichever hand you navigate with. If you look at the pictures at the top of the product page, you see the red marble in the top center, two large, gray paddle-shaped buttons (typically mapped as right or left click)on either side and on top of those, there are two small darker gray buttons (these default to forward and back).<br /><br />  Now bear with me here: as a right-handed guy, my left thumb uses the left large paddle button as left click, and can move up to hit the little button to activate the Universal Scroll (the Logitech Software allows you to customize the buttons as you desire, and I never use a forward-back button, but I am a scroll junkie). My index finger primarily uses the trackball, while the middle one helps it out as needed. Now, here is where I docked a star, although I noticed this going in: my ring finger can tap the upper edge of the right paddle button easily, but to access the tiny upper right button (the one that defaults to forward), I'm required to lift my entire hand off the device hit the button and resettle. I know, I know: cry me a river you say. But it does hinder the otherwise fluid usage of the device. I like the concept of a trackball anybody can use, but not when all controls are not easily reached. I simply don't have that button assigned to do anything, and frankly, I get along great. But I wanted you to be aware of that.<br /><br />  A few more things: if this is the first review you have read on this device and you plan on reading more be forewarned: Many reviewers feel the Marble is missing something (here's a hint: it begins with a 'scroll' and ends with a 'wheel'). Kidding aside, its a valid point - scroll wheels are ubiquitous and many computer games and programs are designed to assume you have one. As I said, I am a scroll wheel junkie. I love that thing! But, when I have the auto scroll function mapped, I click the button once, and scroll with the trackball. Its an extra step, but it took me a day or two to start doing it automatically. I literally don't think about it anymore. So for me, no sweat - I'm very pleased.<br /><br />  Another thing to note is that as of this writing, I have had to uninstall the newest SetPoint software (version 6 something or other) and install an older version, 4.80. The reason for this is that the newest version of SetPoint didn't register the Universal Scroll feature in Office 2007 (I use Word and PowerPoint a ton for school, so I wanted to see if I could fix that issue). I had to call Logitech's service reps who were very pleasant and helpful, and I was told that the software designers know of this issue with the current SetPoint, and are working to resolve it in a future update. Meanwhile, version 4.80 essentially does all of the same stuff that the new version does, so I don't feel cheated there.<br /><br />  Finally I should reiterate something first time trackball adopters may be thinking about: yes, it will take some getting used to using a trackball (thumb or finger style) over a traditional mouse. The first few days you will shakily move the trackball and your cursor will shoot across the screen. You may try to click on a small space on a website and will end up having to make multiple attempts. This is normal, and dissipates quickly. I'm writing this review after owning the Marble for about a week or so and feel quite proficient with it. Prior to a week ago, I used a mouse for ~ 15 years, give or take. And I don't regret the switch. If you are buying a trackball for the first time I urge you: Keep the receipt (if it doesn't float your boat, send it back), use the software to customize the cursor speeds and button layout (you can make the cursor slower to allow you time to adjust to the new device), and have a little bit of patience. Within a few days, you'll more than likely be using it without a second thought.<br /><br />  I hope this was helpful to some of you!y can use, but not when all controls are not easily reached.

Then I tried once more with exFat, only to get the same data corruption.  I contacted Sandisk and they replaced the card.<br /><br />Card #2 did the same thing within two weeks.  I decided I might use the card in my SLR since it was a no go in my phone.  However, it was slower than the three other class 10 cards I owned and the two other class 6 cards I own.  I tested them with both a Windows program, a Mac program, and in the SLR itself.  My slowest class 6 card from Transcend would take 18 pictures in burst mode before slowing down.  Sandisk's \\\\\"Ultra\\\\\" card would only take 14.<br /><br />This problem is well known, just look at the reviews here or Google the card.  So when I talked to Sandisk, I asked that they replace the card with of equal value from one of their different line of cards.  I talked with a representative at length and she escalated the next level of support to see if this alternative was possible.  I was assured that the same representative would contact me shortly by phone so I would not have to go through the whole process of explaining things again from the beginning.  Seven hours later I got a call from a different representative who knew nothing of the problem, requiring me to explain everything from the beginning. He said all Sandisk could do was send another of the same card.  He assured me that the problem with the card had been fixed and that Sandisk's products were reliable.  Funny, the representative told me the exact same thing a month ago when they shipped me card #2.  I have 9 other SD cards (two of the micro SDXC variety) and none of them have had any problems.

Nothing will make the volume any higher, but if you can make the sound this full and balanced it is so much more easy to live with.   Crossover and volume are customized via proprietary (downloaded) software. sound can be changed a bit just by moving the satellite speaker around to suit.    Performance was really my number one concern (would it even work?) when I plunked down the cash for this, but the style and quality and care that went into design extended even into the packaging, I felt like I bought a product from people who cared. I felt better about spending the money.     This is my first review ever, and I thought it worthwhile to spread the word to other music lovers. I take the Bassjump everywhere and it has been a compromise that surpasses expectation, I am actually grateful that someone saw fit to make this.",

            "input": "Amazon launched the new generation of Kindles at the end of September 2013. I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.<br /><br />The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.<br /><br />Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.<br /><br />Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.<br /><br />The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.<br /><br />The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \\\\\"That's it, I'm done.\\\\\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.<br /><br />I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.<br /><br />Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.<br /><br />Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this. Unless you plan to use it plugged in, charge it after every use ... nope. Doesn't live up to its PR or its predecessor.<br /><br />Sorry, Amazon. The HDX isn't ready for prime time.lat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind.

            "input": "I'm of two minds about this power supply. Professional reviews complement the power delivery characteristics, and if mine lived in a server closet, I'd probably rate it five stars. I'm pulling back two because both my TX650 V1 (2010) and TX650 V2 (2013) exhibit coil whine under some loads. Coil whine occurs when copper coils resonate at an audible frequency. The resonance is natural, though ordinarily dampened or designed to occur above 20 KHz. It's harmless except to your sanity. My V1 was fine for two years, but eventually began to squeal at idle. The replacement V2 squeals during network transfers. UPDATE: As does the TX550M. I wish I could blame the system; a Cooler Master Silent Pro 600M and Seasonic G 450 work just fine.<br /><br />SUPPORT:<br /><br />Support is solid at Corsair, but I had some initial trouble taking advantage of the 5-year warranty. Contact methods include an online RMA form, a phone number, and, if you can find it, a hidden email feedback form. Turnaround times for a conventional RMA are measured in weeks. Corsair will do advance RMAs (wherein they send you a replacement first with a credit card hold and you then send yours back), but this is not possible to arrange with their online form.<br /><br />Calling them leads to a phone tree. When I first called, the phone tree ran in circles, eventually to a full voicemail box. Using the email feedback form netted an email telling me to use the same phone tree. I was later informed by email that this was a result of their 'Holiday' schedule where the entire office leaves for a week. This information appears nowhere; you're just meant to infer it when no one picks up.<br /><br />It took three phone calls to set up an advance RMA. Disconnections occurred even during in-office transfers. Hold times were two to fifteen minutes at 1PM on a weekday. The process aside, support ultimately upgraded me to a superior unit and provided return shipping labels, so I'm only out time. They definitely stand behind their product.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />When my V1 was new, it was effectively silent and, at a Bronze rating, moderately efficient. Gold-rated units are 5-6% more efficient, which can result in significant yearly savings ($10-$25) if your load is near rated capacity around the clock. It continues to function even while emitting nasty noises, so I can't knock the reliability.<br /><br />Most power supplies have two general characteristics: they're most efficient at half-load, and half-load is when their fans start to ramp up. If you want a silent PSU, your maximum load should be no more than 60% of rated capacity. A Core i7 quad using integrated video will idle around 40W and draw up to 150W at full load. A mid-range ($200) graphics card will add 15W to the idle and 90W to the max load. A high-zoot or dual-chip graphics card ($400+) can double or triple both numbers. Overlocking can bump the load total by 25%.<br /><br />Because efficiency trails off rapidly below 20% load, and most systems spend most of their time at idle, it's best not to buy capacity well in excess of your needs. Naturally, this conflicts with the silence objective, so it's a bit of a trade-off with Bronze-rated units. Gold units preserve more efficiency at low loads. Some PSUs aren't capable of silence at any load. Seasonic (the designer and builder of the TX series) is better on that front; they use quiet fans and a fan power profile that keeps the fan idling, or entirely off in some cases, at low loads.<br /><br />The TX650 is designed for a system with a quad chip and dual-mid-range graphics cards. Here's how the numbers play out relative to, say, a Seasonic S12-380, also a Bronze unit:<br /><br />0.2 * 650 = 130W<br />0.5 * 650 = 325W<br /><br />0.2 * 380 = 76W<br />0.5 * 380 = 190W<br /><br />Typical integrated video PC:<br />idle: 40W<br />max: 150W<br /><br />Same PC with a mid-range graphics card:<br />idle: 55W<br />max: 240W<br /><br />In all cases, the first PC will be better with the lower-capacity power supply. It'll run more efficiently and it'll still be silent. The other system will put you to the choice: do you care more about fan noise at full load or efficiency at idle?<br /><br />Here's the load ballpark for each component:<br /><br />Quad CPU: 10W idle, 100W sustained<br />Motherboard: 15W-50W<br />Hard disk: 15W spinup, 2W idle, 7W sustained<br />SSD: 1W idle, 5W sustained<br />Optical: 1W idle, 10W sustained<br />Video card: 15W-25W idle, 70W-250W sustained<br />RAID card: 25W<br />NIC/sound/peripheral card: 10W<br />120mm fan: 3W<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />This particular 650W TX is not a modular power supply. Modularity means that some or all cables are attached separately so you can pick and choose what you need. The more wattage and the more concerned you are with a clean build, the more important this feature is.<br /><br />With the semi-modular TX550M, modularity was no great help. Any system liable to require that wattage will use most or all of the available cables. The TX650 is something else; it has four cables devoted to molex and SATA plugs and two more to PCIe. The TX850 has an additional two PCIe. Unless your system has a dozen hard drives, at least a few will end up behind the motherboard tray.<br /><br />Lack of modularity can make for a bargain. The TX650 goes for as little as $50 after rebates. For a Bronze supply of this wattage with this warranty, that's very compelling.<br /><br />The cable sleeving for the three TX and HX copies I received could be improved. The sheath was loose (looking and feeling like a shedding snakeskin) on some cables and gluing wasn't completely hidden.<br /><br />COIL WHINE:<br /><br />If your unit whines, you have two options: RMA it or change the system power profile. Disabling EIST and the C1/C3/C6 halt states in the BIOS significantly reduced my coil whine. Idle power use went up 10-15W. Running Prime95 in the background eliminated the whine entirely. With my Core i7 quad, a single Prime95 thread at 11% CPU usage added 40W of idle power use, more than enough to kick the PSU above the power profile that caused noise. For reasons of performance and efficiency (40W of extra power in a 24/7 machine costs about $50 a year), I consider Prime95 a stop-gap solution until a replacement PSU arrives.<br /><br />IN SUM:<br /><br />In a stacked system, this TX650 would be a wonderful PSU.

I bought the one with 4GB of internal memory because I am retired, and have downloaded close to 10,000 books altogether.<br /><br />Anyway, this Kindle just froze up on me one day, for no reason at all. It wouldn't reboot, it wouldn't do anything. I called customer service, because it was much less than a year old at that time. They just asked me to describe what it was doing, and asked if it had, to my knowledge, been dropped or had liquid spilled on it, which it hadn't. Then, MUCH to my surprise, they told me they'd issue a replacement order for a new unit! A few days later a new Kindle showed up, with instructions for how to return the bad unit with the enclosed prepaid label.<br /><br />I was concerned about having to reload the 5,505 books I had already put onto the previous machine, but to my further surprise Amazon had placed all of them in my Archive, to be accessed whenever I wanted one (or more) of them! I also found out at a later date that they also had saved my entire book collection on My Cloud, offering yet another way to access my books. They made it easy as possible for me to retrieve my books.<br /><br />I love my Kindle(s), but the incredible Customer Service is beyond placing a value on. I am still amazed at how readily they accepted my explanation, without any suggestion that they didn't believe me, or that I was somehow conning them. Incredible company!

I traveled internationally only with the Xoom last year to Japan, Singapore, and India. This worked out very well for me and meant that my bag dedicated to laptop and electronics was suddenly much lighter. I plan on using the Galaxy Tab 2 for every day use like editing documents, writing email, viewing websites, watching movies on netflix.<br /><br />I found the tablet to be very responsive and installed all the applications I wanted but this is where I take one star away and only give 4. If you have an investment in some HD tablet applications like quickoffice HD the market, play store, whatever will claim the device is not compatible. You can install the \\\\\"phone\\\\\" version with no problems. I believe that this is because of the display size primarily but if someone knows more, please let me know here.<br /><br />Getting ICS  by default is nice and means you can get the thing up and running as you want and not sit through updates at first. This makes a very nice difference on these tablets especially. I believe that this form factor is the future for tablets. The Google Nexus tablet will probably come in at this size and we'll see new tablets I believe through this year stress-testing this size.<br /><br />Finally, the tablet has a very nice feel in the hands and the screen is quite nice and fresh. Installing wallpaper does not result in the usual \\\\\"cropping\\\\\" requirements.<br /><br />I was never tempted in the final analysis to buy the Kindle Fire or this tablet. I view the Kindle Fire as a \\\\\"Amazon Experience\\\\\" device only. If all you want is that content, by all means get one. I want one that is expandable, has the market/play store on it, can do more tasks and be a light-weight companion when I do travel. I think traveling with this little slate will be quite enjoyable. If you journey forth for pleasure, try doing it with no laptop and using a tablet. Along with the games, wifi connectivity, bluetooth, etc; I'm sold.",

I've been able to use FaceTime, including the rear camera, without having to make any adjustments or remove the cover.  And while I can't fully enjoy the sleek matte silver finish of my iPad's back side, it's going to stay that way instead of getting nicked or gouged when I throw it in my backpack.  Best of all, since I'm somewhat of a klutz, I've dropped it several times--but between the Acase and the Smart Cover, no damage was done.  The one inconvenience is that if you use a dock for adding external speakers, you'll probably have to remove both covers.  Maybe there's some kind of adapter that would somehow solve this issue, or some way of using the dock with covers on that I couldn't figure out...but at any rate, it's not a huge issue, as the cover does remove fairly easily.

If this is the case order two 8 pin to 2xPCI-E 8 pin Y cables and you will be in good shape length and connection wise. If you have a large case you may want to order extensions for the CPU connections. OCZ could make their cables 2 inches longer and it would solve the length issue. I have seen some negative comments about OCZ power supplies but as far as I am concerned there is no issue and I would purchase this product again.",

What I didn't expect is it shuts off when it isn't being used therefore the batteries should last forever - well, not forever but for a long time. When it wakes up a green LED comes on letting you know it's awake and the batteries have  enough power to support your work. The instructions tell you when the battery (one AA cell) is nearing the end of its life, a red LED will come on. I haven't used it enough for that to happen but I'm sure it will. If that doesn't work as advertised, I will be on with a follow up. The instructions also give you an option to d/l software to take advantage of Windows Eight and move the screen back and fourth in addition to the more conventional up and down. I haven't tried that little feature but when I do, I'm sure it will perform as advertised. Finally, and this is a small item, - I'm talking about the antenna. It's a tiny little thing. It only protrudes from the USB port a 1/4 inch (6mm). You don't even know it's there.

The first problem was solved by installing a Diamond WiFi booster. The Bluetooth problem was solved by throwing away this type of mouse and buying a USB wireless mouse.<br /><br />With these problems resolved its a great little powerful and versatile machine. Acer should take note and in newer models improve WiFi performance and Bluetooth connectability and then they would have a fantastic product to sell.<br /><br />Below is my original review:-<br /><br />In less than a month I am on my third machine. The first came with no sound so was returned. The second machine I managed to break the glass screen on the first day and once again returned the product. The third machine seemed OK until I left the USA to return home only to discover that the WiFi is complete crap. Move more than a few feet from the router and it feels like your connected via an ancient telephone modem. I installed new drivers for the WiFi which improved perfomance a little bit was still crap.<br /><br />Only buy this machine if your going to use it sat beside your router. Forget about being able to use the machine in your bedroom or sitting room unless thats where you have your router.<br /><br />I am now outside the USA and trying to see how I can return this piece of s***, get my money back and return to using my faithfull old iPad.<br /><br />I cannot understand how Amazon sells such lousey products.

I have average-sized hands and it fits perfectly; I use the &#34;palm&#34; grip. I am right-handed so I use the two top main buttons with my index and middle fingers and the side buttons on the left with my thumb. The buttons are easy to click and have a great feel to them. I originally wanted to also use the buttons on the right side but they are not easily accessible without moving my entire hand, so I hardly use them. I also use the top DPI button but I rarely use it to change the DPI, I use it for other things (More on that below in the software section).The mouse wheel rolls just fine, not too loose nor too stiff. However, to click the mouse wheel button requires more force than I would prefer. It seems to be getting easier over time though so maybe it requires a break-in period.  The braided wire on the mouse seems like a good idea in terms of durability; however, the texture of the braid gets caught on the shelf my mouse and keyboard rest on and interrupts my movements. It's minor but still pretty annoying.<br /><br />I love the SteelSeries Engine software that pairs with the mouse. You can set various profiles according to the different games you play. So for instance, in Battlefield 4 I have the top button change the DPI from say 1800 to 2800 for sniping (and there is a light to let you know which mode you are in). But in DOTA 2 I have the button programmed as a macro which simulates pressing &#34;2&#34; &#34;W&#34; &#34;B&#34; on the keyboard, which selects the courier, sends it to the secret shop, and adds a speed boost. It's nice to be able to turn three relatively awkward key presses into one. In the default profile, I have the left side mouse buttons set to forward and back for web browsing, the right side buttons to page up and page down, which is faster than scrolling with the mouse wheel. In addition to programming buttons, you can also adjust the brightness of the LEDs on the mouse and turn them off completely if you desire. I personally really love the &#34;breathing&#34; effect. This is my first &#34;gaming&#34; mouse and it is by far the best looking mouse I've ever had.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this mouse is that the smooth, shiny surface accumulates grime very quickly. I wash my hands regularly and don't consider myself a dirty or sloppy person by any stretch of the imagination so I honestly don't know how it gets this small, kind of sticky stuff on it. I don't use lotion or anything like that either. At any rate, I wonder if other models of this mouse have a different texture and are less likely to get buildup. I seriously have to wipe it at least once a day, which only takes a second, but it's rather annoying. Otherwise, it would easily get 5 stars, especially if it continues to work well for at least a few years.",

            "input": "As long as you know exactly what you are getting with the Hauppauge HD PVR, you won't be disappointed with the performance of this little black box.  It is designed for PC Windows users only, although Mac owners can use it with some add-ons.<br /><br />First, you'll need to understand and accept what this PVR does not do:  without any memory or hard drive inside, it does not store video itself, making the PVR label somewhat misleading, and it does not burn video to DVD.  To use it, you must hook it up to a PC or Mac (more on the Mac later) for both recording and playback.  And it relies entirely on software running on your computer to record, edit, program, and burn Blu-ray format DVDs.  The box itself has no controls other than a power button.  It has component, composite, and S-video connections (no HDMI) for video, and optical and stereo audio inputs.<br /><br />So what does it do?  It takes the HD signals streaming into it and compresses them in a format that preserves the HD quality in a savable AVCHD file; you can record/save manually or on a schedule.  These signals can come from a set top box, camcorder or other video source that can connect with the above inputs. The included ArcSoft Media software for Windows allows you to record on either the computer hard drive or an external one.  Once the files are saved, you may use your computer's DVD-R drive to burn a Blu-Ray-compatible DVD or HD-DVD, edit, play back on your computer or television, convert to iPod-, Xbox-, or PS3-friendly format (MOV, MP4, M2TS, or WMV), or share playback within the same wireless network.  The included IR blaster can change the channels on your set top box to the one you've programmed to record.  Note: the blaster works with the included software and therefore only on Windows.<br /><br />Chances are, you're going to have to do some thinking before you decide how to set up the PVR.  The conversion box is 7.5\\\\\" w by 6.5\\\\\" d by 2/5 \\\\\" h, so it doesn't take up much space itself.  However, you will need a computer next to the HD source.  For those who don't have their computer in the same room as the set top box, this may mean buying a computer specifically for video, and naturally, that increases the price of the set-up.  However, if you don't plan on recording every day, you can hook up/unhook a laptop very easily - just pull out the USB cable and your connection, if any, to the television.  Hauppauge includes the basic component cables (HD source to PVR) and USB cable (PVR to your computer), but, if you want to play the video back on your TV, you will need to buy the necessary cables/connections for that.  As of June 2009, the bundled PC software includes a program that allows your PC DVD drive to play the PVR Blu-Ray-format recordings.  Depending on your set-up, you may want to add a USB hub, an external hard drive, and/or Apple TV.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Mac users, Hauppauge does not support OS X, which means you'll have an additional software expense.  Two software packages currently work with the Mac and the Hauppauge. The cheaper and less elegant solution is a program called HDPVR Capture, developed and sold privately by a Hauppauge engineer.  The fuller featured, more versatile option is Elgato's EyeTV , but unfortunately, you can't use several of the features because it doesn't communicate with the IR Blaster to change channels.  Both programs are available only online, although EyeTV 3 comes bundled with Elgato hardware products.  If you can find a workaround for the blaster issue, the EyeTV 3 will be nothing short of awesome.  It converts the PVR files to a wide variety of formats used by iLife programs.  Hauppauge really needs to work more closely with Elgato to satisfy the rapidly growing Mac population.  If you are a serious videophile and Mac user, you'll probably also want a product like [[ASIN:B001OLZOW8 Roxio Toast 10 Titanium Pro]].<br /><br />The minimum systems requirements for the PVR are: Intel Core Duo processor, 512 MBRAM (1 GB recommended), graphics card with at least 256 MB memory, and a sound card.  Windows users need either the XP Service Pack or Vista 32.  I'm using a three year old Intel Core Duo MacBook without any difficulty.

            "input": "Update 6/30/2015: This laptop is still ticking away. I now have the power options set to sleep on lid close, and I don't use the touchscreen much in day to day use so those issues have pretty much disappeared for me -- I do not know if they are legitimately fixed at this time but since the power setting change the trackpad has not caused any issue at all.  This laptop is typically on my desk beside my main computer, for using Facebook chat or reading messages boards while I use the main one for playing games or videos.  I also take it with me whenever I need a machine away from the house, and don't bother bringing the charger -- it beats any tablet I've used in speed and also battery life depending on what exactly you're doing.  I really can't complain too much about this computer.  It does feel a bit sluggish at times but I still believe that's more to do with the hard drive than anything else, because once it gets going on a CPU intensive task it's quite impressive &#34;for a 1.9ghz machine&#34;.  I have also managed to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 much more smoothly than I had anticipated, although it can't run at maximum settings.  I frequently take it from the desk to the bed and run on battery power for continuing Facebook / message board use and I've been impressed with battery life.  One thing that irks me is that with large (inefficiently encoded) 1080p h264 video files it seems to stutter, and I'm not sure why because the CPU / iGPU should be more than capable of handling that plus some.  It's 100% been my 1080p video game recordings from my main computer using NVIDIA ShadowPlay that cause this problem so it may just be the way it's encoded.  If I recode them in Handbrake with my custom settings (which are pretty hefty) they work just fine.  I'm reluctantly adding the fourth star here just because this laptop, even with its faults, is the best $500 I've spent and I wish I had gotten one sooner.  And just once again, the sound that comes from this thing is amazing.  Every time I turn up the volume on a video or song I'm still surprised at how crisp and vibrant it sounds.  To be fair, one other thing I have to note is that occasionally it will say &#34;unrecognized charger&#34; or something along those lines, and will continue to run but not charge (or discharge) the battery.  This seems to only happen during CPU / GPU intensive use and unplugging + replugging the charger fixes it every time.  Not sure what to say about that one.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Update 4/19/15:  Overall the replacement has been doing well.  It runs everything I expected it to so far and the performance is about where I expected it to be.  It's pretty smooth and the battery life is good.  I'm leaving my stars where they sit for now and I'll go into that in a minute but some things I've noticed:  Battery -- If I'm browsing the web or doing something non intensive, the computer claims the battery will last anywhere from 7 hours to over 10 hours depending on what you're doing.  But if you're using the CPU at 100% or a combination of CPU/GPU, that number will drop to about 2.5 hours.  According to my history so far of actual usage (powercfg /batteryreport)... the low end of my projected battery time is 3.5 hours, high end is 7.5 hours, for an average of about 5.5 hours.  I almost always use it for a mixture of web, lightweight games, and videos while on battery.  I find this quite acceptable and similar to what I expected for this CPU.  I haven't timed how long it takes to charge the battery but it seems faster than most laptops I've used.  Apps -- Sometimes Metro apps take an abnormally long time to load, and I'm not sure why.  It's usually Facebook or a file manager that does it.  My Venue 8 Pro doesn't do this, and this CPU is more than capable of running any app, so I don't know what to say on that other than &#34;weird&#34;.  Once loaded there aren't any problems.  Sensors --  Gyro is smooth and responsive, I have been playing Asphalt 8 some using tilt steering.  The light sensor seems to be well adjusted for screen brightness (not too bright, not too dark) although I do wish the minimum brightness of the computer in general was a little lower for very low light use.  I understand most screens don't go extremely dim, but it seems like it should be an option.  Sound -- I really didn't expect to have anything to say about sound, but the speakers are surprisingly crisp and loud for their size. Don't expect theater quality sound or a hidden subwoofer, but it'll probably make you do a double take the first time you crank something up.  Speed -- I really don't have any complaints in that area. I know it's not a gaming computer by any stretch but I have been able to run Civ V, Sims 4, and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage without a hitch after a few tweaks. I haven't tried much else besides older games so far (DosBox, Tiberian Sun, Empire Earth II, etc). I should note that to get the best experience you'll want to run any newer games while plugged in, to enable active cooling and eliminate any CPU / GPU throttling unless you want to change those settings manually, which will decrease battery life.  One thing I noticed is restarts and starts from shutdown are slow despite Windows 8's quick start feature. I'm willing to bet it's mainly the HDD's fault and upgrading to SSD will probably make a world of difference. I almost always use sleep or hibernate so it's ready quickly and isn't a big deal to me.  Input -- In general the touch input (screen and touchpad) takes a little getting used to but is acceptable, if a little less responsive than you might expect.  Sometimes though for whatever reason, it gets weird (this is why my stars are staying the same).  It's not often enough for me to return it but it's often enough to be irritating.  For the touchscreen I notice it starts to degrade or stop responding in certain areas of the screen (random areas) before eventually becoming unusable or not responding at all.  This seems somewhat random.  The touchpad sometimes will disable everything except the &#34;button&#34; area of the pad.  This seems to be a little more likely to happen if I close the lid while the computer is on (power setting: do nothing when lid closes) and open it back up again later.  I suspect that both of these issues are driver related because I can't seem to &#34;cause&#34; them by any movement of the computer or lid, except sometimes fully closing the lid.  I hope it will be fixed soon.  For some reason, 99% of the time, either or both of these problems can be fixed by putting the computer to sleep and waking it up again although I have had to do a full shutdown or restart a time or two.  Conclusion:  This computer is so close to the mark of what I was looking for in this purchase that I almost feel bad about giving it only 3 stars.  But a problem like not accepting input, is something I can't say I've ever seen before and that really brought me down out of the clouds.  The price is nice (compared to similar products), it looks and feels good, but to get an edge it must deliver on its promises consistently.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Update 4/7/15:  I ended up getting a replacement of the same model because it was easier and I hoped I would get a good one.  So far so good.  This one does not have the keyboard warping I described before, and the hard drive seems quieter.  I am installing apps and updates now... Will be cautiously upping the stars a bit until I figure out how this goes, but I'm still a little upset about getting a bad one.  Things happen though and I'll update again later about this one.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Update 4/4/15:  Well I guess I spoke too soon.  I really wanted to like this laptop but it looks like I couldn't avoid a defective one after all.  Within 24 hours of having it, it's developed a problem in the screenwhere it seems to invert some colors.  This is not a Windows or driver issue as it happens from the time it's turned on, in BIOS, and in diagnostics.  It's also retaining ghosts of any image left up for any period of time (minutes) that don't go away until hours later.  I will be sending this back as soon as possible and deciding whether I want to chance it with another one or go for the 1.7ghz version again.  If I get another of this model I will update again...  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Original (too early) review:  I had originally bought the older 1.7ghz i3 model of this laptop due to the 4/5 bad reviews on this one (and a hefty discount on the other for buying a lightly used one), but when things didn't work out with that (shipping drama, long story) I decided to take a chance and grab this one against my better judgement.  I figured if I could avoid one of the defective ones I should be able to count on the touchscreen / trackpad problems being fixed and any other minor bugs being worked out to some extent.  I've only had it a few hours but so far I'm glad I did it.  One confession I have to make is that I'm a bit of a Dell fanboy, but I think with good reason.  I have had a lot of computers over the years, and I work on them for friends and family.  As far as laptops go I get more HPs thrown at me with hardware problems, and more Dells with software problems -- usually the problem is between the keyboard and the chair.  I have had several Dells myself, I even have a working Latitude XPi P133ST from 1997 purely for nostalgia, and overall they've been good to me and relatively trouble free.  With that out of the way...  Overall this is a very solid laptop.  It looks and feels nice although a bit heavy for a tablet, but that wasn't the main reason I bought it.  The case doesn't have a lot of flex, and it doesn't seem to creak and pop if you pick it up by a corner while open, which I'm prone to do.  The hinges are pretty snug and it doesn't wobble around excessively.  There will always be a slight wobble with any laptop and this is apparent when using the touchscreen in laptop or stand mode, but not annoyingly so.  The keyboard area is a little spongey (which is pretty common these days) and this one in particular seems to have a very slight upward curve in the middle, neither of which affect performance (and not really noticeable if you aren't looking for it) but that's just me being picky.  The older model I had for two days was also spongey but did not have the curve, so that isn't related.  Probably a minor manufacturing defect that I can overlook.  At first I was put off by the buttonless trackpad but it seems to do pretty well, and I do like that it can click anywhere on the pad.  The fan is on the rear of the computer which is kind of odd but I see why they did it; if it was on the side like usual then it'd be kind of awkward to hold in tablet mode.  I wanted this because it was a reasonably powerful small form factor machine and had a touchscreen, which I personally think Win8 is worthless without.  This is meant to replace both a Dell Inspiron N5050 (2nd gen i3 @ 2.3ghz) and an HP Mini 1104 (dual core Atom -- which had a failing wireless card when I got it second hand, if anyone's counting HP hardware problems).  It theoretically is the best of both worlds -- comparable power to the N5050, with the form and battery life of the Mini.  Don't quote me on this but by my calculations and a little research, a Haswell U-series i3 @ 1.9ghz should give a Sandy Bridge M-series i3 @ 2.3ghz a good run for it's money while using around half the power.  On these things, it seems to deliver.  The hard drive is definitely the bottleneck in this computer and I'll probably be replacing it with an SSD in the future.  Once it's booted up and ready to go, it handles &#34;normal&#34; tasks with ease and is quite smooth.  With the integrated HD4400 I think it should play a fair amount of moderngames, if only on low settings, but it may have to be plugged in for that since the passive cooling setting and other tweaks for battery operation will degrade the performance.  As for the battery... I can't say for certain yet but I think I am going to be pleased.  Out of the box it had ~95% charge and I've been messing around for about 5 hours, some of that time was plugged up (#1 to make sure it recognized the charger and would charge, and #2 for bios update) and it still says it has 22% charge.  Most of that time was spent installing software, copying files, and extracting archives.  If you're playing games or doing anything CPU / disk intensive your battery life will be cut in half probably, but with some light web browsing and such I could see it easily lasting 7-8 hours from a full charge if not more.  I'd imagine a few tweaks in the power settings for the GPU performance, video optimization, and max CPU state could stretch the battery a bit.  In conclusion, so far I have had no issues out of this little guy other than my being picky about the keyboard.  It's done everything I've asked of it and then some.  The trackpad has been a little odd on occasion, mostly being not quite as sensitive to taps as I expect.  Or it could be that I'm just not used to it yet.  So far I'm very happy with it and I will update if anything changes.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that literally hours after I bought this, Amazon reduced the price by $60.  Assuming the computer is in good working order (time will tell how many are defective I guess), I don't think you can go wrong at this price range.  Similar models from other manufacturers seem to go for more money and still have less battery life, so the decision to go Dell once again was pretty easy for me.  Sorry if this was long winded, but I hope it helps someone.",

The pockets aren't as well organized for holding all my various computer gear as my old bag ([[ASIN:B000WQCYDI Swiss Gear Ibex 17-Inch Notebook Backpack]]) which was awesome EXCEPT the old bag didn't handle my oversized computer well.  (Actual computer dimensions: 17\\\\\" x 13\\\\\" x 2.5\\\\\")<br /><br />I don't like it when things can fall out of a bag . . . and the storage inside that \\\\\"clipped flap\\\\\" (2 big mesh pockets) would be great for holding stuff, but don't have a zipper to secure the contents.<br /><br />SO . . . bottom line:<br />Five stars for fitting my ASUS G73J<br />Minus 1 star for mediocre bag layout & being such a \\\\\"basic\\\\\" bag.<br /><br />I'll use it for a while . . . and if I get to really like that flap, I'll upgrade back to 5 stars . . . but . . . for now . . . I would highly recommend this bag as a basic transport for your ASUS G73J.<br /><br />((EDIT)) . . . minus another star for lack of padding & the bag doesn't stand up on it's own.  I replaced the bag with this [[ASIN:B00507NAYQ Targus Drifter II Backpack Designed for 17-Inch Laptop TSB239US (Black/Gray)]] . . . a MUCH better bag!  The [[ASIN:B00376ANBK ASUS G73JH-X3 Laptop Computer]] does NOT fit in the computer slot, but it DOES fit in the same compartment, is well padded as such, and even fits in that compartment WITH my backup computer (HP G60-535DX).",

If you don't like the touch sensor mouse that it has you can connect a mouse view usb or wirelessly to accommodate your preferences. I don't use apps as much on it, so a lot of space is just taken up from pictures on my phone while my music and videos are all separately put on an external hard drive.

Maybe it'll update somewhere down the line, but it's whatever.

The mechanism that allows the case to fold into a stand is firm, and the stand itself is sturdy once you situate the iPad directly into the grooves on the cover. It does add thickness to the device, but that's to be expected with a padded leather folio case.  edit: The initial case I received from the seller became slightly loose/defective after several months of use. I sent a message to the seller and promptly received a new case within 2 business days that's *improved* over the previous design. Very impressed.  AYL tweaked the design a bit to make the notches in the cover more angular instead of rounded. This benefit allows the device to now use all the notches for the stand, as opposed to only the first few. Very pleased with both the case and the seller's service.",

The connection where the power cord connects to the USB piece developed a problem. I have to position this part of the cord manually so that it will keep working. Otherwise, the fan stops working. I believe, in a few days, the cord (and so the fan) will be completely useless. The manufacturer has to make better quality power cords (thicker; not just a tiny, slim cord). It is nice that the fan itself is slim (as the name implies), but the power cord shouldn't be that slim; it has to be thicker. I searched their website; I couldn't find power cords as accessories. With a replacement power cord, the fan would be fully functional again... until the same thing happens. Where do I find a replacement power cord (preferably better quality)?<br /><br />Also I attached sticky rubber pads to the bottom of my notebook, so it doesn't slide anymore when the tabs in the back of the fan are extended (see my first review below).<br /><br />Review for the one I purchased on 6-6-12:<br /><br />Pros: Very efficient and nice design. Large fan, silent, slim and light.<br />Cons: If you use it in a flat position, it is OK. However, if you use it in an inclined position (by flipping the tabs in the back), your notebook will slide, as it has no rubber pads (What is the purpose of adding tabs to the fan, if it has no rubber pads to prevent the notebook from sliding, I wonder). After 2 hours of initial use, it started to produce a strong, burning-plastic odor. I had to return it the next day.",

Maybe it will loosen up a little over time, but as it is now, compared to the OEM Samsung cable, this cable requires about twice as much pressure to plug in.  3/8/2015 UPDATE: After hearing repeated complaints about the tablet taking a long time to charge, I finally got around to checking the charge rate using a &#34;USB Charger Doctor&#34; type device. Turns out that this cable maxes out at less than 1/2 amp, no matter which charger I use. The OEM cable charges the Samsung Galaxy Tab S at about 1.75 amps, with the OEM charger, or any of the Orico multi-port chargers I tried.  Since I specifically asked the seller about this before I bought it (and was told it 'supported' a 2 amps charge rate when used with the OEM charger) I have reduced the rating to one star.  I now know that in order to charge at the full rate, either the cable or the charger must have the data lines connected together. This cable does not.",

Thankfully I have a full tool shop and was able to take the fans to my jigsaw and cut off the extra plastic that was blocking their installation.  That being said, that is NOT the reason I gave the product a 2 star rating.<br /><br />The reason for the 2 star rating is due to the self tapping screws that come with the fan.  They are ABSOLUTE RUBBISH.  The screw is supposed to seat itself into the plastic mounting hole of the fan for installation.  This requires quite a bit of torque on the screw.  I am by no means a muscle head, but without fail, each head on the screws supplied got stripped while simply trying to turn them in by hand before they were even flush with the case.  This happened with no less than 3 different screw drivers, just to make sure my tool wasn't the issue.  I then had to take needle nose pliers to back each screw out.  Fortunately the screws that came with the Cooler Master fans were still around.  I twisted them in with no issue and now have the fans mounted.<br /><br />Having gone through all of that, I would say avoid these fans and stick with Cooler Master.

I also have an Intel PRO 1000 PCI Express NIC installed.  The SH67H3 is well made and on par with the quality of the SD37P2 V2. It is extremely quiet when running. I like the brushed metal and uncluttered look of the front of the PC. Other pluses are the recessed front power button (which prevents accidental pushes), along with adjustable brightness of the blue power LED.  Note that the Mini PCI connector on the motherboard is *NOT* mSATA compatible, and is intended for Wi-Fi adapters, etc., not SSDs. In order to install a 3.5\\\\\" hard drive into the 5.25\\\\\" bay I used a [[ASIN:B0001UZQWG StarTech.com 3.5-Inch Universal Hard Drive Mounting Bracket Adapter for 5.25-Inch Bay BRACKET]]. There is space enough behind the 5.25\\\\\" bay for a 2.5\\\\\" SATA SSD, so I may add a SATA 6Gbits/s SSD at some point in future.   Unlike the SD37P2 V2, the SH67H3 does not have space for three 3.5\\\\\" hard drives plus a 5.25\\\\\" optical drive. In order to install Linux I also ordered an external  [[ASIN:B005FUKLHM Sony Optiarc USB 2.0 Slim Portable DVD Writer, DRX-S90U]], which sits on top of the PC case. The drive needs two USB connectors and would only work for booting the Linux install CD when plugged into two USB 2.0 ports, and would not work on USB 3.0 ports. (The front of the PC has two USB 3.0 ports and a USB 2.0/eSATA combo port, so the drive has to be plugged into the back).  Check the Shuttle Website for BIOS updates. My SH67H3 needed flashing - no big deal.  I'm running Debian 6.0 on the SH67H3 and it makes an excellent Linux server box. Highly recommended.",

For example, when it comes to flat panels, the product lines offered consist of: <br /> <br />X Series - Consumer line <br />P Series - Professional line <br />G Series - Graphic line <br /> <br />This is not a comprehnsive list of all their product lines, but is what you will find in your average retail outlet. <br /> <br />The VX910 (notice the X in the model name) is a decent monitor. For $500 though, it is subpar, even for being a Consumer line product. The colors are good, but the quality of the display is substandard. Red hues in the upper left corners, noticeable pixelation during refresh and an overall grainy appearance make this monitor pretty average for the money. <br /> <br />Night and day difference between X series and P series! <br /> <br />The VP191b (Pro line) is a superb monitor. Beatutiful, crisp colors, smooth display. No pixelation. All for $550- thats just $50 more than the X series! Now, I understand that when this monitor first hit the market it was signifcantly more expensive, but today, I would strongly recommed it over any X series, the VX910 included. <br /> <br />",

I always keep my cover on and put my computer in a neoprene sleeve, so it's taken care of.<br /><br />At first I couldn't really figure out how to snap the bottom part of the case on since it's different than the speck case, but figured it out and like it even better because the two pieces that broke off that case aren't on this case. It fits differently, which could be a bad thing I guess because there is a small portion of the rear corners that are exposed, but at least I know they won't break off and the bottom part of the case just slide off.<br /><br />I love the color. It's very accurate to the picture on Amazon. I wasn't planning on using the keyboard cover, but it turned out to be such a pretty color I decided to give it a shot. Plus it'll keep the keyboard clean. It's super easy to pull off too, so if I decide I don't like it, I can just pull it off. It does take a minute to get used to how the keyboard feels wit the cover on...but I really like how quiet it makes the keyboard, so I can type around others with less noise.<br /><br />I just got it so I can't talk about how long the case will last, but for the Amazon price, it won't really bother me if I have to replace it in a year because it was significantly cheaper than the Speck case.",

When it came and I easily snapped his iPad into the top clamshell and charged up the keyboard, the differences between the one I had (but seldom used) and this one were clear. While mine was bulky and did not always support the iPad in an upright position, this one is slim and has solid support for the iPad to sit in not only horizontal upright, but also vertical. The arm attaching the two sides of the case slides out to accommodate your desired angle, and - get this - it pivots to allow you to turn your iPad into a vertical position if you prefer! My husband loves it, but, unfortunately, so did I. I convinced him I needed to take it on a business trip with me because it is slimmer and lighter weight than mine, plus the protection it provides is much better with the solid, though lightweight material in the clamshell than the padded vinyl cover I have. I took it in carry-on luggage through airport security and was able to easily use it on the plane and throughout my 8-day trip. The keyboard held its charge throughout my trip, and I loved the ease and security of this product. I own one other New Trent iPad case with this same clamshell material, thought it does not have a keyboard. I loved the protection of that one, although there were design issues I did not like and I seldom use that case. This Airbender 1.0 is maybe the best keyboard case I\u2019ve ever seen. I had to give it back to my husband when I returned from the trip, but it won\u2019t be long before there will be a second one in my house. Now if only they would make them in a choice of colors so we will be able to tell them apart!",

I love both the cases, they are both durable and well made.  I have dropped my ipad several times and nothing has happened not even a scratch.  I have done the same on the otterbox and it has scratched the corners of my devices.  The reason is that the Griffin Survivor case has better cushioning in the inside case, while the otterbox is all hard plastic on the inside case.  So, when you drop the otterbox the hard plastic corners push up against your device causing indentations and scratches while the Griffin does not.  In addition, when looking at the screen in the Griffin you get a clear view on the Otterbox you get a clear view with an oily film.  Not sure why this happens, but it tends to happen on most otterbox cases with the covering.  The stand on the Otterbox case is better in my opinion and it does come with a cover to protect the screen, while the Griffin does not.  They both weigh about the same.  It will make your ipad air heavier, so keep that in mind.  It is a sleeker looking case, the Griffin but to keep it protected from drops and bangs, you get the added layers of weight.  I would highly recommend this case for those with kids or people that tend to be rough, or afraid of dropping it.  It's worth the added weight to me, for that security.",

No contest here. With all of my drives and Corsair TX750 transferred from the Antec, it was MUCH easier to tuck cables out of the way behind the motherboard panel, thanks to lots of rubberized holes around the motherboard mounting, the rear-facing orientation of the hard drive bays (the HDD trays fit the drives very snuggly), and the extruded side panel. Makes for plenty of room in the case for GPUs. Looks stodgier by comparison, but I don't really care.   Couple gripes: the HDD trays -- if you try to install an SSD, the retainer clip for HDDs gets in the way. Also, what's with the current fad of putting USB ports right above optical drive bays? Sure it makes for easy access, but dangling cables can block ejecting trays.   Really nice case overall. Would buy it again for a new build.     Edit: You can remove the pins in the HDD trays for mounting an SSD by removing the entire pin bar.",

            "input": "I purchased this Zippy BT500 keyboard as a warehouse deal, seller PCMicro.  It arrived quickly, couldn't be distinguished from new (despite being classed as \\\\\"used\\\\\").  Very happy with the vendor.<br />  The keyboard is more than I could hope for!  The picture shown on this vendor listing is the earlier version of the keyboard, without OS-specific \\\\\"hot keys\\\\\", but the item shipped was the current version with iOS (ipad) hotkeys.  I have an android 4.0-- nearly every hotkey I've tried so far works just fine, and I have a feeling that those that don't quite completely function as expected are due to Android, or device-specific problems.<br />  This keyboard is tiny-- about 8.75\\\\\" overall width, and only about 8 1/8\\\\\" actual key width.  I'm a man with average width hands (glove size large or xl), but probably thinner than average finger diameter, and I'm a touch typist.  A few minutes use gets me aclimated to the tight spacing. A chubby friend at work (same width palm as mine, but fatter fingers) had problems with the key width.  Since I'm pairing it with a 4\\\\\" smartphone, living with the small size of the keyboard is an easy choice to gain portability.  Key action is a traditional keyboard scissors action with good feel and a reasonably deep throw.  The keyboard has a slight tilt when placed on a desktop which I find natural, but there are also kickstand feet underneath the rear if you desire a steeper tilt.<br />  There are a few details worth making note of:  This is one of only 2-3 keyboards of this size that I could find that has nearly every key in the standard keyboard position-- I would have said \\\\\"every\\\\\", but someone pointed out today that the tildy and backslash keys are misplaced.  Still a great advantage over the common mini-keyboard practice of relocating the question mark & apostrophe keys, and/or missing right shift, tab, backspace, etc.<br />  If you have occasion to do number-crunching on your tablet, this is also the only 8\\\\\" keyboard I could find that has imbedded number keys (calculator layout) that can be switched into play-- losing, of course, the corresponding letters while in use.<br />  I've tested the keyboard with the stock browser, Kingsoft Office, InkNote, Gmail, and AOL mail-- it works flawlessly with all.<br />  The keyboard is somewhat thicker than some of the other mini keyboards, at least partially because it uses AAA batteries instead of a rechargeable pack. (just over 3/4\\\\\" thick).  As a trade-off, the keyboard does not seem to go into hibernate mode to save battery, although there is sometimes a slight delay in getting back up and running if you've let it sit for a while-- but no need to press pairing or reset buttons again.<br />  Pairing was simple with good directions included. This keyboard can be paired with multiple devices, saved into settings of the keyboard, and selected from the keyboard as to which device you want to pair with. (I only have a single bluetooth device, so I haven't tested this function, but other reviewers say it works well.) So far, it remembers the pairing flawlessly, and connects about 15 seconds after I turn it on.<br />  The directions do not go into detail about the special function keys, however.  The Search key calls up the search entry box in my web browser, and acts as a \\\\\"find\\\\\" function in my office app.  Repeated clicks of the Search key will place a cursor in position, and then place begging/end cursors around the search term.  (I haven't figured a way to enlarge/shrink the highlighted area, or to activate cut/paste/etc directly from the keyboard.)  The home key takes me to the main Android home key, and I can pull up in-app settings directly from the keyboard, and select/enter with the arrow and return keys.  The arrow keys work well to navigate and select apps from the home page, and to navigate around a text document and menus. Escape functions as a \\\\\"back\\\\\" key with my Android.  Some popup/dropdown menus still require using the screen, but any menu \\\\\"sidebar\\\\\" seems to navigate fine from the keyboard.<br />  I haven't tried the media keys as of yet. I can lock the screen from the keyboard, and I can call up the \\\\\"locked screen\\\\\" from the keyboard if it's gone into hibernate-- so far, haven't figured a way to actually unlock the screen without swiping the screen itself.<br />  There are a few nit-picky flaws I'll mention.  The key labeling seems to be decals, and may wear off over time.  The decal has a shiny surface, so the labeling can be hard to read if the area lighting is at the right angle to cause a glare on the decal.  I wish the overall design was somewhat thinner, but so far it's certainly a compromise I'm willing to accept given the many excellent qualities of the keyboard.  I wish it came with a cover, so that I could feel better about tossing it into my knapsack.  (A feature missed by all but a few \\\\\"portable\\\\\" keyboard manufacturers.)  Obviously I haven't had it long enough to comment on long-term quality, but it seems to be quite solid despite being 100% plastic.  The keyboard doesn't have as many hotkeys as  some I've seen-- if I find it's missing something that I really need, I'll try External Keyboard Helper from that other App Store (costs a few dollars, but allows re-mapping keys for special functions.)<br />  Overall, I would definitely purchase this again based on my initial use.  At full price, it's not cheap.  But, it's also a great little keyboard without most of the flaws I've read about in other keyboard.",

I have a newer PC and didn't think the \\\\\"PC not recognizing the drive\\\\\" complaints would apply to me. Usually, my PC is very responsive and a fly could land on the USB port and my PC would recognize it...not with this drive.<br /><br />I tried this on several drives on my laptop and two other laptops I own and it wouldn't recognize it on any of them. I would plug it in, you could hear the drive spinning (LOUD) and my PC didn't notice it at all.<br /><br />I did a little more research and this drive apparently requires 800mAmps of power to start up but can run on 400 mAmps afterwards. A normal USB provides 500mAmps, so you can see therein lies the problem. So, a work around is to get a Y Adapter or a powered USB hub and the drive from that but if I wanted a bunch of complicated cables or a wired HUB I would have purchased a desk top hard drive not a portable hard drive.<br /><br />This was just way too much work for me and I think it's completely ridiculous that I should have to go purchase some additional equipment to make something work that should work just out of the box.<br /><br />Thankfully, amazon has a great return policy has paid for return shipping.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for making this right...even when Seagate couldn't make their product right!!!!!",

            "input": "I noticed several folks that had a bad experience with CF card compatiblity, especially in terms of expected vs actual performance.  You should check out the digital storage review section on dpreview.com, where they test the raw read/write speed (using a firewire card interface), the speed in high-end digital SLR type cameras, and representative point-and-shoot digicams.<br />It turns out that some high-speed CF cards are a poor match for digicams, and will actually perform worse than ones that are appropriately speed-matched to the device.  For instance, I've had very good performance with Lexar 12x 128 MB CF cards with my Nikon Coolpix 4500.  It comes packed with an 8x Lexar 'starter' card, and test results on dpreview.com with the Coolpix 995, which is very similar bear this out.  Faster cards for that camera would be a waste of money, and might not even perform as well.<br />On the other hand, I've ordered Simpletech 512 MB cards to go with my new Canon EOS Digital Rebel SLR, because if you go to Canon's site and look at their recommended storage media, they sell Simpletech cards.  There is a definite reason for this.  If you check out dpreview.com, you will see that Simpletech, among others, scored very well when married to such 'pro-sumer' or pro digital SLR's.  The Lexar and Sandisk CFs (two very well-known brands) fared poorly, by comparison.<br />So, if your camera came with a 'starter' card, find out the speed and manufacturer of that card, and buy some more just like it, or maybe a bit faster and more than likely more storage.  If your camera didn't include a card, check out the camera maker's web site to see what they sell, or pester them to tell you what they tested the camera with.<br />Unless you have a camera that shoots RAW photos (if you don't know what that means, you don't have one, and probably don't care), then you should always shoot in JPEG Fine at the highest (or possibly 3:2) resolution.  Digital storage is cheap, and life's too short to shoot in 640x480, and wish you hadn't, the one time you want to make an 8x10 enlargement.  Once you figure out the average size of JPEG file produced for typical shots, then get a couple of like-manufactured CF cards sized for about two rolls of film (about 64 shots).  For the 4 MP Nikon Coolpix 4500, that comes to about a 128 MB card (a far cry from the 16 MB 'starter' card they include).  With one card in the camera, and a spare card in your pocket, you are set for a day's worth of shooting (unless you are a button-happy picture-shootin' maniac -- in that case, get a battery-operated USB drive with media slots, like the Xs-Drive-II to store your shots on, instead of buying a ton of CF cards).<br />I'm now back for another 512 MB card.  I've had no problems or complaints with the first one in my Digital Rebel.  I'm currently using it with a Lexar USB 2.0 Multi-Card Reader, RW018 Rev. B on an ASUS P4B533-E motherboard-based system (has six USB 2.0 ports, and two firewire).  Works like a charm, after I found out that you don't need to load the Win2K drivers supplied with the reader, if you have a recent service pack on the system.  Otherwise, the two sets of drivers clobber each other.",

I love new technology and if I have the cash I buy it. This laptop was bought though with the pure intent of complete and utter future-proofing myself as well as finally getting the most powerful mobile gpu out upon release for once. (I usually am behind on the technology.) I really am hoping for about a 5 year lifespan at minimum on it, I know I'll have to lower details over time, but for now I am enjoying full &#34;Ultra&#34; or &#34;High&#34; details (depends on max settings for a given game.)<br /><br />Games I currently play are: Minecraft (I run a server as well, not on my laptop but is hosted elsewhere), Saints Row 3 and 4, Sims 2 and 3, Farming Simulator Titanium Edition, Starbound, Terraria, Bioshock (all), Borderlands 1 and 2, Diablo 3+ expansion, Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars+ expansion, Supreme Commander 1 and 2, Dungeon Defenders plus many others. This laptop plays all that maxed out and at 1080p no problems! Now I know I haven't listed many heavy hitter games, but i can say that this will play anything out now at 1080p on &#34;High&#34; and I may be conservative on that.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />The Alienware has the winner on this for build quality, with it's reinforced alloy frame, but this laptop isn't very far behind on quality. This laptop is a cross between the Alienware and the Sager. The Sager had a better build quality than the Samsung I felt.<br />This doesn't mean this laptop is cheap feeling, far from it. It's got just about as good a feel as the Alienware did but not quite there. The keyboard does feel much better than the Sager, but the Samsung's keyboard was a winner in that spot. The screen on this laptop doesn't wobble as much as the Sager did or the Samsung did. It's a tie between the Alienware and this one. Also, this laptop probably has more of an Alienware look than the Sager or Samsung one did with the multi-color keyboard and extra lighting.<br /><br />Features: This is a hard one to compare, but personally this laptop wins out.<br />6x USB 3.0 ports, 2x Mini Display ports as many audio connections to support 7.1 surround should you want it. This laptop also has a blu-ray BURNER! which was more than what the Alienware had with it's default DVD-Burner. This laptop also has a direct button for switching between the dedicated GTX980M and Integrated GPU. This requires a reboot but the Alienware can do this as well with a Function key. But there is pretty much a shortcut button for this.<br /><br />Performance: This is unfair as each laptop was pretty much an upgrade over the previous one. So obviously this MSI laptop outbeats the past ones.<br /><br />Price: MSI wins, for $2300 you get a beast of a laptop. Alienware (as of this writing) doesn't have the 980M gpu and will probably charge far more for the same setup.<br /><br />Cooling: The cpu seems to sit at about the same temperatures as previous cpus, but the gpu maxes out at about 72C when being pushed to it max during benchmarks which obviously push it to it's max. (Chances are I won't max this gpu out for a little while.) This laptop has an excellent cooling system. It does get a little loud when the fan ramp up to max, but I took a like at the physical fans and they are the largest fans I've seen in a laptop. Max speed I hear a faint whine, but chances are your gonna be gaming and not notice it, and honestly if anyone else complains they should just shush up themselves. (I wouldn't suggest gaming in a library, while it may not be super loud that's just disrespectful, but ultimately any ambient noises will probably drown this laptop. Also I must note that the fan noise is only noticeable at max speed which you may not reach, I only reached it by hitting the &#34;Turbo Fan&#34; button. Even when benchmarking I didn't notice the fans much if any.<br /><br />Storage:<br />This comes with a single 128GB m.2 SSD and a 2.5&#34; 1TB 7,200RPM HDD. This laptop only supports ONE 2.5&#34; drive, unless you replace the optical drive with a Hard drive caddy. BUT! It has a total of 4 m.2 slots. with current m.2 SSD's you could put 4x 512GB SSD's in plus the 2.5&#34; HDD! SSD's are coming down in price pretty good, I remember when a 64GB might have cost $300+ now it's nothing. A 512GB SSD now cost about $280 now! a few years ago that would have been probably $1000 or more!<br />I do plan on adding in an SSD very soon. I also must state that MSI DOES include all the screws needed to add in more m.2 SSD's.<br /><br />Audio system: The Dynaudio system on this MSI blows me away! The Sager plain sucked, I will admit it, The Alienware sounded really good as well as the Samsung, but the MSI's blows them away in my opinion. Now I'm not a audiophile and far from it, but I enjoy listening to my music as much as the next person and also like to share music or videos with others and this sound system can fill a medium room pretty decently. There is plenty of range and it is far from sounding tiny!<br /><br />Overall, I am VERY pleased so far with this laptop and plan on upgrading it's 128GB SSD with a 512GB SSD. I will keep the original SSD as a Driver/ Dump drive until I can afford a second, third and fourth 512GB SSD. But otherwise it is one BEAST of a laptop without being HUGE! It is even outdoing my desktop somewhat and that has a GTX 770 SC gpu in it. (I read it could rival a 780 which may be overkill for my personal needs, but I got the money so why not?<br /><br />Incidentally I have to get rid of my desktop due to downsizing on my living arrangements which is why I was forced to another laptop, so I just decided to go all in this time around. Short of if I could upgrade on my own I figured I would just do that on my own for a tad cheaper.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything changes or after 6 months of ownership with plans on updating my review every 6 months until I can't edit/ update it anymore or get rid of the laptop.<br /><br />All in all if you got the cash, I suggest this laptop if you are looking for something to game on the go, i really don't think it will let you down!marks which obviously push it to it's max.

Consumes only a small amount of power (I've heard 17 Watts, which seems about right) and is very quiet, unless the fan is on. I did not find this information on any reviews or on the Maxtor online help, but enabling the media server (which is off be default) will kick the fan on indefinitely until you disable the media server again. Despite being a small fan (35-40mm), I can hear it from across the room (12 ft). So I was disappointed that I couldn't just keep the media server on forever, effectively ruining the synergy it has with my D-Link DSM-520 media player. Also, my media player can't find the videos/pictures/audio I put in the NAS unless their in the pre-allocated \\\\\"My music\\\\\", \\\\\"My photos\\\\\" and \\\\\"My video\\\\\" folders, which are re-created if you delete them and then enable the media server. I used the 2 rear USB ports as a print server and to attach another external hard drive. Some people have said that the print server is slow. I've only printed out small jobs and it does seem to lag sometimes. Note that since the printer is no longer attached to a dedicated computer, the printer software (ink reserve checks, diagnosis tests) are not available. Any USB hard drive/flash drive you stick onto the NAS needs to be FAT32 (according to Maxtor), otherwise you might have limited read/write access. The speed is the expected speed of a 100Mbit connection. It would have been better if they included gigabit connectivity for future-proofing.  <br /> <br />Summary: Good 10/100 Mbit NAS with print server, but issues w/media server which seems to trigger noisy fan, even if no CPU load. This negates the advantage Maxtor had on media server-less NASes for me. No gigabit connectivity. Overall, if using for basic backup and network storage, this is good and quiet. If trying to utilize everything Maxtor equipped, you'll find some quirks.  <br />",

Fits snug in the case, keyboard is easy to type on, screen is in the right angle to view when typing, and love the shortcuts that are predefined on the keys.

Easy installation into a PCIe slot with no extra power cords to attach as would be required by the higher end, more powerful cards.<br /><br />The main objection I have to this card is the consistent intrusive whiny noise generated by the small fan on the card.  Unlike many cards which are noisy at startup but slow once Windows is fully booted, and at relative idle except on demand, this fan runs at full-out speed all the time. I admit that I am sensitive to noise in computers, but for me this characteristic was a deal-killer, even with the desktop tower placed in a kneewell.  I wound up exchanging it for an Asus fanless Radeon 5450 card with otherwise similar specifications and performance except that it was dead quiet, as would be expected.  Even running it for hours, again with routine computer tasks, I felt no significant heat on the conductive heat sink, so that occasional reviews complaining that it overheats I deem to be totally unjustified and were probably either mean-spirited or related to unwarranted overtaxing with overclocking or extreme gaming, neither of which are within the purview or designed function of such an entry level card.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: For those of you who don't care all that much about noise, or who are used to substantially noisier computers, I think you will find this card a bargain. For those of you with sensitive ears, go for the 5450, as described above, for approximately the same price.",

The cord was a bit in the way so i thought lets buy this mamba since its the exact same thing except wireless...I was wrong.<br />When my mamba arrived i first marveled at the legendary boxing which probably cost 20$ out of the 100$ price of the mouse. Once i had unboxed the mouse i felt and it and was almost exactly the same feeling as the deathadder except the coating was smooth as the deathadder had a bit of grip. After 1 week of use i was absolutely impressed but thats when things started to go wrong. First my mouse would have this little \\\\\"jiggle\\\\\" which after many hours i found out is because that mamba tracks very high so when i moved my mouse i would lift it unconciously maybe half a millimeter off the pad which would cause this little jiggle.<br />I thought i could deal with that as it was a really good mouse.<br />Then my mouse would randomly keep running out of battery. Then i found out that some genious at razer designed the mouse so that you have to turn it off every time you want to charge it on the dock otherwise it will drain the battery.<br />After dealing with that i came to yet another problem. The mouse kept turning off randomly and i could not figure out why. The battery was at 100%<br />This lead to my final problem which led me to my decision to try to exchange it..<br />My mouse will hold absolutely no charge on its battery. IT WILL NOT TURN ON IN WIRELESS MODE.<br />I have to use the wired mode because the battery will just not hold a charge. So i will wait for this replacement and maybe continue the review after i receive that. If the replacement also has problems. I will repurchase the deathadder as that had no problems whatsoever<br /><br />***********************************<br />Fixed***************************<br />After receiving another mouse ive kept it for a week and it showes no issues of which i had with the other mouse... yet so im moving it back up to 5 stars. :Dcontinue the review after i receive that. If the replacement also has problems. I will repurchase the deathadder as that had no problems whatsoever<br /><br />***********************************<br />Fixed***************************<br />After receiving another mouse ive kept it for a week and it showes no issues of which i had with the other mouse... yet so im moving it back up to 5 stars. :D",

I thought I might use this device occasionally to read an iBook or watch a video.  I was wrong.  I use it ALL THE TIME.  I've been using Apple laptops ever since I got out of college because I like bringing my computer around wherever I go or watching TV while I surf the web.  After buying an iPad, I'm looking into replacing my laptop with a Mac Mini and making my iPad my primary computing device.  If you think about it, what do MOST of us use our computer for MOST of the time?  Surfing the web, checking email, organizing pictures, listening to music and watching videos.  The iPad can do all these things.  Even those who use their computer for more \\\\\"serious\\\\\" activities (word processing, music recording/editing, keynote presentations) will find that iPad can do all those things as well, though you may have to actually purchase an app to do some of those things.  In addition, this thing is GREAT for travel.  Bring this on a plane and you can watch a video or read a book.    True, the iPad will not REPLACE your laptop/desktop for most people, but you will find that you end up using your iPad instead of your computer for most things.  You will still need your regular computer for the large hard drive and flash videos (at least until Apple fixes that in an iOS), but you may even find that you prefer your iPad for things like email, Facebook, and the web.  Without using an iPad 2, I can't really make many comparisons to the two models.  I haven't really wished my iPad had a video camera because I can't imagine holding this thing up to take videos, and I have my computer and iPhone for Facetime.  I can see how a lighter weight might be nice, but I haven't really found this device to be all that heavy.  Bottom line, don't think of the iPad as an extra little toy that Apple came up with just to make a few more bucks.  If you use a computer atall or if you do a lot of traveling, you'll find that this device will become your new best friend.",

I took it with me to college after my previous laptop - an Acer Aspire - failed me horribly. My Aspire had an issue with overheating, which only presented itself after my warranty expired. The cost of repairing it was not worth it when compared to getting a new laptop that was smaller, lighter, more powerful, and more capable of multi-tasking (more RAM).<br /><br />I come from a family that has been using Macs for over a decade, although I myself preferred Windows computers...up until Windows Vista came out. We had many Macs around the house growing up since my parents use Macs in their office, and I was never really impressed with the Apple Operating System, so I had doubts about the Macbook. But since the Macbook is loaded with 2GB RAM and an Intel processor, you can run BOTH Mac AND Windows operating systems with ease. I therefore figured worse comes to worst, I'll use my Macbook as a laptop to run Windows XP with. I used it very heavily in college and it served me very well. It's light weight allowed me to easily carry it from class to class, its included photo and video editing software gave me hours of productivity, and perhaps best of all, it was reliable! I really loved my Macbook and would like to give it 5 stars...but...<br /><br />My sister, who was in graduate school, also got a Macbook at the same time I got mine. Her laptop fared well, up until the end of last year. For some reason, the laptop started getting buggy...it'd freeze, it would overheat, it became a major nuisance. We've reformatted several times, hoping that would solve the problems, but to no avail. I HIGHLY recommend getting the AppleCare protection plan. We regrettably didn't, and really don't feel like forking over the money to repair the Macbook since she doesn't use it much anymore anyway. But our attempt to save money by not getting the protection plan will end up costing us more money now, should we choose to repair the laptop! The experience with our second, identical Macbook, is why I have to give 3 stars instead of 5 for an otherwise strong performance product, that can run both Windows and Mac, that comes bundled with a lot of great software, and that looks really cool (especially on a college campus where almost everyone has Macs!)<br /><br />A last note...I have more recently purchased the sleeker Macbook, and would like to emphasize that while its construction is nicer, and it doesn't look as cheap as this plastic one, I still think this is a good deal. If you're looking to \\\\\"wow\\\\\" people and can splurge, get the newer model, but if you are looking for a powerful laptop and don't care too much about having the latest build, this one is just fine. I still use my plastic one even though I have the newer (cooler-looking!) one.choose to repair the laptop!

I'll skip the wall of text and dive into what you care about instead:<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Keyboard<br /><br />The Good<br />+ The keys have a great click feeling that make typing very easy and comfortable.<br />+ The keys are well spread out.<br />+ SetPoint allows you to disable the Windows and Caps Lock keys.<br />+ The F1 - F12 keys are defaulted to perform their media functions (e.g., pressing F9 mutes instead of performing &#34;F9&#34;).  You need to press Fn+F# in order to send the desired F# key.  That said, I believe SetPoint allows you to swap this functionality (e.g., you need to press Fn+F9 to mute instead).<br />+ Dedicated on/off switch (not a button so you can't accidentally turn it off).<br /><br />The Bad<br />- No Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys.<br />- No numeric keypad if you want one.<br />- No &#34;flippers&#34; to incline the keyboard if you're into that.<br /><br />Overall score: 9/10<br /><br />&#62;&#62; The Touchpad<br /><br />The Good<br />+ Larger than most touchpads.<br />+ Surface is slightly rough providing a nice tactile experience.<br />+ Supports a wide array of multi-touch gestures.  It supports up to 4 finger recognition (swipes, presses).<br />+ SetPoint software is fairly customizable (e.g., you can change the scroll direction when 2-finger scrolling).<br />+ Very sensitive.  You don't need to press hard in order for the touchpad to detect your finger.<br /><br />The Bad<br />- Poor click/movement detection.  This does not mean the touchpad is not sensitive.  Rather, the software driver has a hard time distinguishing when you want to click and when you want to move the pointer.  Sometimes you'll click when you want to move the pointer, and sometimes you'll move when you want to click.  This happens often and is a large annoyance.<br />- The touchpad has 2 DEAD ZONES.  If you look at the touchpad and draw a vertical line about 0.66&#34; (I don't have a ruler handy) from the left and right sides (like this: [ |  | ]) of the touchpad, those are the dead zones.  When you're moving the pointer and your finger crosses either of these lines, the pointer will momentarily stop.  If I had known about this beforehand, I probably wouldn't have bought this keyboard.  These dead zones might be related to software-enabled scroll regions but I didn't see anything in the SetPoint settings.  I am also on the latest version of the SetPoint software as of the date of this review.<br />- Mechanical click actuation is stiff.  I'm usually a mechanical clicker but I think I'm going to rely on tap clicking with this touchpad because it's just too stiff.<br /><br />For reference, I have used a number of touchpads, and this one ranks near the bottom.  If you think you're going to have an Apple experience with this touchpad, you're gonna have a bad time.<br /><br />Overall score: 3/10<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Recommendation<br /><br />Get this if you're a mostly keyboard user but want the option of a touchpad.  You may want to look at the cheaper Logitech K400.  I haven't used it, but the price difference is large enough to warrant a look.",

It has a removable mike, over-the-ear headphones, a padded headpiece, and both USB and audio jack cables, the last for mobile devices. And the sound quality is quite nice, with excellent stereo differentiation.  These headphones are great for gaming, watching films, creating podcasts, and, to a lesser degree, just listening to music.<br /><br />My only complaint about these headphones is that Turtle Beach says that they are Mac-compatible, yet the Dolby surround sound feature is not available to Mac users.  In fact, the company says that there are different listening modes for music and home theater, even though I seem to have no such options on the Mac.  Since most gamers use PCs, that usually isn't a problem; however, if you want to use these for watching DVDs, you cannot get the same degree of immersive experience.  (Note:  I don't know if this is an inherent Mac issue or an oversight on the part of the manufacturer.)  That said, the headset still reproduces great sound for DVD watching even on a Mac, and the mike works well for creating podcasts and talking on the phone.  I found the headset somewhat lacking, although still competent, for music listening.  If you have a PC, the first thing you should do when you open the box is to go to the Turtle Beach site and download the drivers for PCs.<br /><br />Bass is well produced on the Recon 320, although I expected more of it, especially given that bass is a critical sound component of gaming.  Voices are clear.  Even without surround sound, stereo effects are crisp and immersive.  Both the audio cable and the USB cable have in-line controls for volume, and the audio cable enables phone answering.  As expected, the audio cable is relatively short at about 4'.  The USB cable is longer since this is what users will need for gaming, about 7'.<br /><br />I found the Recon 320 to be comfortable enough to wear for hours because of the generous padding.  The earpieces are sound-porous, however, so you will hear ambient noise, and other people will hear what you do.  Depending on your gaming/listening environment, this could be either a deal-breaker or a non-issue.  I also like that the mike boom is flexible so that I can position it exactly where I like.  Of course, the fact that the mike piece is removable is another great feature, especially for people who want to move from one use to another with ease.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannugh to wear for hours because of the generous padding.

All get very hot on left palm rest, Fujitsu junk software slows down XP immensely. Takes forever to boot on domain with XP. Fujitsu very much dissapoints, we will not be back.

There is no setting to allow you to display a full frame.  The result is that if your camera has a typical 4:3 aspect ratio, you will lose a significant part of the picture.  The box arbitrarily pans across part but not all of the photo to compensate.  There is no zoom as on my old Roku either so you can't get to just a part of the photo.  Some of the TV features are nice to have but as other reviews noted, the HDTV standard requires full 5.1 sound.  Let's hope there are some software fixes to this box soon!

It's certainly sturdy, there's no questioning that, and I feel extremely confident that my MacBook will survive in there unscathed.<br /><br />The problem is, the bag is big, and yet it doesn't hold very much, at least by my standards.<br /><br />The \\\\\"CORE\\\\\" protection system inside takes up a lot of room, and of course, the MacBook itself, while thin, is big, because of the beautiful widescreen display on it. The bag itself weights about three pounds, the MacBook another five and a half, plus then the charger, so you're talking about nine pounds right off the bat to be carrying all the time.<br /><br />The bag I had before this, a Jansports green \\\\\"messenger brief\\\\\" which I could sling over my shoulder, or carry like a briefcase, just like this, was, and still is a great bag. It held a lot of things, and I would pack it thusly. I can't do that with this Brenthaven bag.<br /><br />If I have my MacBook in this bag, I can fit, say, two half liter bottles of water, the MacBook charger, my cell phone charger, and two 120-page spiral notebooks for class.

I can't do this anymore.<br /><br />So, again, while the Brenthaven bag is nice, don't expect to carry much in it other than the MacBook itself, and a notebook or two, espcially if you use the mesh holdings inside to store things like bottles of water.<br /><br />The back of the bag has a pouch to store stuff in, but don't expect to put much in it because to close it (via velcro), it can't be bulging out much.

I was looking for something that would<br />protect the Kindle and the ones created by Amazon are just too pricey for what they are( many are sold at big box stores at the same crazy prices) I searched on Amazon for something I thought I would like and found this MoKo case. It is great quality, well made, has a magnet closure and an inside sleeve for credit or biz cards. I like that my Touch slides in at the top, not just held in place by elastic bands, it is completely secure!  My only issue ( why I gave 4 not. 5 stars) is that there are no openings in the back of the case to accommodate the speakers in the back of the Touch. This should not stop you from purchasing, it's still great and a great price . I like the purple color, it's muted and attractive.",

I figured that with the gas I will save on books I buy locally (not to mention, I pay full price for them) and shipping I will save on books I buy from Amazon plus the discounted price, My Kindle should pay for itself in about 16 months.     For us geeks who moved to the country for the love of nature, we are able to have a great book store too that could not possibly be more convenient.    I love the large size.  I saw the Kindle 2 and for me, the larger size of the DX is more natural and comfortable.  Everything is better than I expected.  The page turn is fast.  The text is crisp, clear and as everyone says--NO GLARE.   Setup was easy.      It is a bigger deal to me because of the inconvenience of a regular bookstore where I live.  This makes my life perfect.    What may be nearly a con (I am just too happy with it to really complain about anything) is that it is a bit heavy.  Heavier than the Kindle 2.

Prior to sending it back it was examined, there apeared to be corrosion around the copper waterblock (which is not really a water block, more on this in a minute).  The second cooler failed in exactly the same way.  Again more corrosion.  This time, thouroghly fed up with Corsairs terrible support I dismantled the entire cooler.  I found extensive corrosion to the back of the copper &#34;water block&#34; I pulled appart the stupidly designed pump to find more corrosion to the internal surface of the impeller around the spindle.  The was the cause of the rattle that is the sound of failure, the only way to repair this cooler is by replacing the pump unit as the spindle is damaged by the corroding impeller too.  The cause of failure.... cheap coolant that was acidic.  Certainly was not coolant that was designed for this kind of use.  The seal around the &#34;water blocks&#34; copper contact surface is very bad too, this allowed for a small quantity of coolant to make its way out and air to make its way in, further compounding the failure.<br />The way the thermal sensor makes contact with the copper is very poor, leading to inaccurate thermal readings and control.<br />The &#34;water block&#34; is laughable, its a thin 2mm peice of copper plate, on its back is a rubber material obviously desinged to flow control the coolant.  This rubber covers most of the copper and so prevents thermal transfer heat from the copper to the coolant.  The corrosion mentioned earlier obviously corrodes the exposed area of copper and so furhter reduces the performance of the system.<br /><br />Its a pooly designed, badly made peice of garbage.  The designers of which have/had no clue on materials science or even rudimentary chemistry to understand how their materials would be affected by the coolant they choose.  I can't speak for their newer models, but needless to say I have completly lost faith in Corsair products.  Had a few cases and had problems ranging from catches breaking, fan control knob failing and even broken front usb port cables.  Memory I have had a few and the heat spreaders became loose on all of them, one shorted out.  Dont get me started on their SSD's  Thats for another review.<br /><br />Their replies to all of these complaints:<br />&#34;You can return the item, once its received and the fault is validated we will send you a replacement free of charge.&#34;<br />I said:<br />&#34;So I have to have my system out of action for 2 weeks becuase of your terrible product&#34;<br />Their reply:<br />&#34;You can avail of our swift replacement option, you provide us your credit card details and we send a replacement, your card will not be charged if we receive the product back&#34;<br />Thats all well and good I suppose, but every time I tried to arrange to have my product replaced in this was I was told &#34;That Item is not in stock&#34;",

My daughter purchased an Apple unit, and the alignment is not any better than this unit, so price/performance is the only comparison at hand and this unit wins, no question! Don't forget to re-set the PCM when you swap the battery (remove the old battery with the laptop off; press & hold the power button for 5 - 10 seconds, and proceed with installing the new battery). Additionally, charge the battery only when the battery power level is low. Lastly, calibrate your laptop battery at least once a month by using the computer with the battery low until it goes to sleep and won't wake; let it sit and run down until it shuts off; then charge the battery completely in one sitting.

There isn't a on/off switch to this lamp but that's not a big problem for me since if I want the light to turn off all I have to do is unplug it from my laptop. If you're wondering if this lamp will be bright enough I can almost 100% assure you that it most definitely will be bright enough!

Great pebbled leather cover with soft interior to protect my Kindle.  The convenient elastic closer fits in a groove on the cover, and has enough tension to keep the cover closed.

After using the Kindle with the cover, the \\\\\"ears\\\\\" don't interfere at all and actually protect the corners from dents and dings.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with this product, and have just purchased 3 more for use with my children's Kindles.<br /><br />Cheers!",

Despite this they told me that it was a critical failure and offered to sell me a refurbished Kindle 1 with a limited warranty for $100.  For me the fixed cost is too high.

It does not even mention that there is a power cable that must be used for this card. Nowhere. I even looked on the CD based manual, and it only says, \\\\\"Plug in power if applicable.\\\\\"    2. The card will not run. I plugged it into the 150 watt video power cable (it only requires 75 watts), but the machine does not boot and I get a \\\\\"You must plug in power cable\\\\\" error.    3. I tried looking for help on their website, but you must register first. Ok, I tried registering 4 times and kept getting some kind of funky error.    4. Next step, I tried the online chat function. I entered a full description of my error, clicked on \\\\\"SUBMIT\\\\\", and got an error that the help desk is only open from 8am to 5pm PST. It was 8:47 am PST, and during a normal work day.    5. Next step, I tried to email them using their \\\\\"Contact us\\\\\" link.

Installing the speakers was very simple. Just plug it in to the wall and connect the audio cable to the one where the previous speakers where connected. Installation time: less than 1 minute.<br /><br />As far as sound is concerned these speakers get the job done. They get fairly loud and are more than enough for the average consumer. Are they movie theater quality? No. But i was not expecting them to be. Not at this price. It is enough for YouTube videos and the occasional music.<br /><br />One of the speakers has a port to plug in headphones and a volume control toggle. Both come in handy when you want to quickly silence the speakers.<br /><br />The only little thing that i did not like is that they are a little bit bigger than i expected. Is it a big deal?

Here's some of the things that really grow on you as a Kindle owner. Being able to get a book almost instantly is killer, and separates the Kindle from other ereaders. Getting that first chapter free is also very nice. Being able to download public-domain ebooks in Mobipocket format is also very cool.    And, I understand why DRM .MOBI doesn't work on the Kindle... it's a design decision that, upon reflection, I agree with, because it makes a lot of things possible with the Kindle and with Amazon, that will be of great benefit and utility to Kindle owners, that just can't be done using the DRM .MOBI format.    In short, if you're in the market for an ereader, you really ought to get a Kindle!    ---    I had the chance to play with a Kindle ([[ASIN:B000FI73MA Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device]]), thanks to a friend who was a beta tester, and decided to order one. It's on the way.    I don't want to give yet another blow-by-blow description of the device; enough people have already done that. Instead, I want to talk a little about why people should strongly consider buying the device AND I want to give a little advice to Amazon that will make the product even more appealing.    First, anyone who thinks that a PDA or mobile phone with an LCD screen is \\\\\"just as good\\\\\" as a Kindle has never used a device with eInk technology. The Kindle's screen is very un-computer-like, and very much like reading paper. If you haven't seen one in person, you really can't comprehend how much easier on the eyes an eInk display is. It's effectively the difference between reading a laptop and reading a book... yes, it's that good.    The Kindle is going to revolutionize the book industry, much as the iPod revolutionized the music industry. Yes, it has some birthing pains. Yes, the page forward and page backward and back keys, on the sides of the Kindle, make holding the device as one would normally hold a book a bit ackward. The device is best when it is rested on your lap, or another surface, while you read it. But, the unique thing about the Kindle is that it is completely self-contained. No need for a computer.    You, the reader, can be anywhere that Sprint's EVDO network will reach (all populated areas in the US), and you can get any book available from Amazon. No other ereader can do this today. Yes, I know the iRex iLiad has WiFi, but WiFi doesn't work everywhere. I'd like to see Amazon add WiFi to the Kindle so it would work on home and corporate networks and at places with public WiFi access, but this can wait until v2.     The biggest flaw I see with the Kindle is that it doesn't currently support DRM-enabled Mobipocket files. Mobipocket is owned by Amazon, and the Kindle will read unprotected Mobipocket files, so there is no technical reason for this limitation. Of course, there is a business reason: other publishers can't put protected media on the Kindle using the widely-used Mobipocket format.     I understand that Amazon wants to be the sole source for content, just as Apple wants to be the sole source for DRM music on the iPod (that's why Apple sued Real Networks after the Rhapsody music service figured out how to be iPod-compatible). But, this is a little different. Amazon promoted the Mobipocket format as an open standard.    The way around this is for Amazon to offer either DRM Mobipocket support on the device, or to offer a conversion service for Kindle owners for Mobipocket DRM to Kindle DRM, just as they have converters for other formats. Let new Kindle owners have 90 days of free conversions so they can bring over all of their currently-owned Mobipocket ebooks, and then charge them thereafter. This would be the best of all worlds. Current eBook owners who are prospective Kindle owners don't have to worry about re-buying theircurrent eBooks. Other prospective Kindle owners don't have to worry about only being able to buy eBooks from Amazon. Other publishers, who followed Amazon's Mobipocket guidelines, aren't frozen out from providing Kindle owners with content. And, Amazon gets to make a little money for every book that goes on the Kindle, whether or not it came from the Amazon Kindle bookstore, while also protecting itself from unfair trade practices lawsuits. Everyone wins.    I'd also like to see Amazon offer an SDK for the device, and a good web browser. The Kindle is truly a transformational device, and I'd be willing to bet that websites will start being reformatted so that they display optimally on it.     In summary, like the original Palm Pilot, the Kindle is a transformational device. Unlike the Palm Pilot, it is much better at data retrieval and display, and I fully expect that soon it will be used in ways that Amazon hasn't yet imagined. If you're a prospective customer who's really into books and reading, buy one. If you're Amazon, add online conversion of DRM Mobipocket ebooks to .AZW, quickly!",

I don't know if there was one bad production run, or conversely, one good production run, and I just got lucky, but after a year of daily use, my bag looks exactly as it did when I bought it.  I don't even have any scuffing along the sides like my previous bag.  All the stitching and zippers have held up nicely.<br /><br />I think that the positives have been well covered by now in other reviews, but I'll add that my 17\\\\\" Macbook Pro fits perfectly, with a little extra room all around.  My ER earbud case fits in the appointed headphone pouch, so that was a bonus, though I don't use the little pass-through port.  As mentioned, there is plenty of storage, and I have a ton of documents and my organizer in the largest pocket, plus a ton of cable, adapters, other accessories, and office supplies in the remaining pockets.  That's another point in favor of its durability, as it is packed solid -bulging in some areas- and I still haven't busted a zipper or seam.  I haven't had any problems with the TSA in using the ScanSmart feature, probably in 20-30 trips through a checkpoint.<br /><br />On to the negatives...<br /><br />1.  Padding on the bottom of the laptop pocket.  There is none.  Well, there is the thinnest strip of foam built into the bottom of the bag, but it might as well not be there.  As others have mentioned, I have heard the crunch when setting my bag down too hard on more than one occasion.  I should add some additional padding to the bottom myself, but there is no reason why I should have to.  The lack of padding should have been glaringly obvious in the design stage.<br /><br />2.  Lack of organization in the pockets.  I'm sure this is a personal preference issue, but my two smaller pockets look just like the ubiquitous 'junk drawer.'  Everything is just thrown in there with no organization, because there is none, save for the few office supply slots in the medium pocket.  My previous bag had dividers or internal pockets in every external pocket.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a great bag for the money.  You could spend double and not get as good of a bag as this one.",

I Dj a lot in San Francisco and I also do lots of outdoor stuff like parties and some street fair stuff, so clear and really loud are my priorities. This has been an excellent investment. I own 6  behringer B250d's. Great speakers that i have used for years and for the price, they have more than paid for themselves. These, however are a super sweet upgrade.

I think for the money, these provide a great range and lots of output for all kinds of situations.<br />The one thing that might be an issue down the line is the digital DSP board on the back, as analog usually hold up much longer, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.<br />The Speakers are also lightweight and really easy to move, but they dont have stacking brackets, so you cant stack them up in a tower.<br />Stands and Covers are nice quality.

            "input": "The bottom line is that I would not recommend the Lenovo Z565 to anyone, for any use or at any price.    I did not purchase mine through Amazon, but from a computer retailer with a good reputation - under duress.  My previous Lenovo Think-Pad crashed during finals, and I HAD to have something that got me through - on a limited budget - ASAP.  I would have been miles ahead if I had dug deeper into my savings and purchased a quality machine.  This one is NOT.    The specifics:    Pros  - The aluminum hand rest is aesthetically pleasing  - The LCD display seems as bright and sharp as other mid-range laptops, but it does not compare to my prior high-end TFT display.  - I find battery life acceptable:  2.25 - 2.75 hours  - It is reasonably lightweight  - The \\\\\"feel\\\\\" of the keys when typing is good - but the layout of the keyboard is a deal-breaker.    Cons  - It is SLOW    - I am not able to stream video (as in YouTube or MP4 files) without it locking up and giving me the pinwheels of death.  Since a \\\\\"cinema experience\\\\\" is what Lenovo is marketing for this machine - this is a deal-breaker.    - Speaker quality is extremely poor.  At maximum volume it is impossible to hear audio with even a small fan running in the background.  It is difficult to make out words with NO background noise.  Even tweaked through the control panel, the range and quality of sound is poor.    - There is a random, sudden problem that happens sometimes when resting ones hands on the aluminum hand rest adjacent to the touchpad:  It blanks out the screen without warning and sometimes repositions the cursor on the screen - inserting it in the middle of a prior sentence.  Perhaps this is a faulty machine?    - The keypad layout is HORRIBLE!  I noticed prior to purchase that the layout of the keyboard was off-set to the left of the machine to accommodate the 10-key numeric keypad at the right hand side.  I thought that like a new cell phone text pad - I would get used to it.  NOT.  No matter how much Itype on this, my hands can not adjust to the odd location of the cursor arrow buttons, or the off-set layout.  While the keys do have a nice \\\\\"touch\\\\\" to them, this layout results in excessive typos for me, along with ergonomic strain from shifting to match the odd layout.  I have had numerous laptops and type on multiple computers with different keyboard layouts at work (in excess of 60 wpm), and have never experienced anything like this.  I do not use the numeric keypad and this was not a factor in my buying decision, but I did not expect it to cause problems with useability.    - The touchpad is extremely poor!  Yes, as other reviewers have noted, it is somewhat grainy.  That has not caused any issues for me.      ...But - it is almost impossible to browse the internet using this machine because the touchpad randomly opens links and popups as I am scrolling down pages.  That happens at a very high volume meaning I am constantly closing windows I have no interest in.  As I am moving the mouse within a webpage such as the Denver Post site, it randomly opens ads they have embedded in the page.  I am NOT clicking to open these - the computer is mis-reading my hand moving over the touchpad.    ...It also sometimes will not scroll at all.  There is a designated scroll location at the right hand side of the touchpad.  Sometimes there is no problem, then other times it will not function to scroll down the page until I manually move the cursor to the page scroll cursor at the right hand outside edge of a webpage.  This is also random, but frequent.    ...When typing emails in Gmail, or using an Excel spreadsheet or Word document - the cursor randomly and suddenly repositions itself at another location within the page.  This is incredibly frustrating as I sometimes do not notice until I have typed a ways down the page.  This happens when my hands rest a moment on the touchpad, and when I am just typing normally!    ...It also has some issues when using Excel from MS Office 2010.  It RANDOMLY will not display cell contents when \\\\\"wrap text to fit\\\\\" has been selected, particularly when I have set this for the whole spreadsheet.  I am able to open the same Excel file on a machine at work and view the cell contents.  The contents are there, but not visible except in the cell reference line at the top of the page.  This makes updating spreadsheets extremely painstaking.    I have had many laptops including HP and a Lenovo ThinkPad and use community computers and laptops at work and school and have never had an overall negative experience.  While each machine may have its quirks, none rendered them as useless as this Lenovo Z565 has been for me.    Ultimately, the bad audio and video capabilities combined with the virtually useless touchpad and keyboard make this Lenovo Z565 a bad buy.  Yes, I got a good price, but I learned a lesson.  I have had it less than a year and will be purchasing its replacement in the near future.",

The amount of features it has is without parallel unless you talking about another gaming rig from say like, Alienware. The toshiba x500-110 comes with the intel i7 core chip 720 at 1.60ghz which tranlates into 3.2 ghz to 3.8ghz maxium cpu speed, a bluray player/burner coupled with an 18.4 inch screen that brings a crisp 1080p for watching hi-def movies or gaming, 8gb ddr (european model which I have#, two 500 gb hard drives #1 terrabyte# wow!, windows 7 premium, a ton of toshiba software which are really great, security features like face recognition and fingerprint #however haven't got the face recog. to work yet#, harmon kardon speakers are superb, and many more features. Now my review is that while the toshiba qosmio x500 is loaded with all anyone could want in a laptop it's HEAVY AS HELL! I couldn't find a carrying bag in any stores, but found one made by toshiba here on amazon. That's the only con I have for anyone thinking about buying one. It looks really sleek and the design is beautuful and can pass as a non-gaming laptop unlike an Alienware rig which is clearly for gamers. I play pc games and can safely say this can play anything except Crysis warhead I think because of the windows 7, but Crysis warhead as everybody who games knows pushes everything in regards to graphics and cpu usage to the limits. I've played COD waw, Half-life #brilliantly#, Bioshock, Left4dead 2 #amazing), Unreal 3, Dirt 2 and PES2010 all in 1080p and with ease. It comes with the nvidia 250 m chip which does well enough and I'm so happy with that because you can't upgrade laptops, so I should be ok for the next 3-4 years. This laptop is considered a desktop replacement so if you want the reliabilty of a desktop without the bulk of a desktop then this is it.

            "input": "I eventually made it work :)  The problem was about 1) the documentation, and 2) the device version difference.  The documentation is a disaster. Besides, there are at least two versions of the Iteaduino: v.1.0 and v.1.1 (I don't know anything about others). They are different, and so they require different jumper settings.  This device works fine, provided that you use the correct settings.  Here is what I discovered.    1) First of all, to load a sketch you MUST NOT use \\\\\"Arduino UNO\\\\\" setting from the Tools > Board menu in the Arduino IDE. The board looks like UNO, but is can't be programmed like UNO! Choose \\\\\"Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328\\\\\" instead.    2) Look at the version of your device on the back side. It must be 1.0 or 1.1. You should use different jumper settings to program the device depending on the version of it.    3) The device has three working modes:  a) PC connected to ATmega328 via USB - a \\\\\"normal\\\\\" Arduino mode. You load sketches and use a Serial port over USB in this mode.  b) PC connected to HC-05 chip via USB - you change HC-05 Bluetooth chip settings using \\\\\"AT\\\\\" commands.  c) PC connected to ATmega328 via Bluetooth - that's why you bought this board. You can't load sketches, but you can use a serial connection over Bluetooth to make an external Bluetooth device (PC, cell phone etc.) to communicate with your Iteaduino sketch program.    4) In mode a) you should use the following jumper/switch settings:    jumpers: remove all jumpers;  switch: any position, but it is more safe to set it to DAT.    And when you upload a sketch, don't forget: it is a \\\\\"Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328\\\\\", not \\\\\"Arduino UNO\\\\\".    5) To succeed in mode b), you must first UPLOAD A SKETCH which doesn't use a \\\\\"Serial.begin()\\\\\". You may use the simplest \\\\\"Blink\\\\\" sketch example from Arduino IDE. Of course, you must use mode a) described above to do it. Every time you want to change HC-05 settings you must first switch to mode a) and replace your current sketch with \\\\\"Blink\\\\\". (Youcan avoid sketch reloading if you have an option to make your sketch somehow to skip the Serial initialization.) I believe that this requirement is an Iteaduino BT design issue.    In mode b) you should use the following jumper/switch settings (set them when the power is OFF!):    jumpers: v.1.0: position \\\\\"B\\\\\". v.1.1: position \\\\\"A\\\\\".  switch: position CMD.    Connect a USB cable, open a serial terminal, set speed to 38400 and configure your device using AT commands. Every command should be terminated with CR and LF in this order (you may just use \\\\\"Both NL & CR\\\\\" option in Arduino IDE terminal window.)    A description of of the AT command set can be found here:  http://www.linotux.ch/arduino/HC-0305_serial_module_AT_commamd_set_201104_revised.pdf    IMPORTANT: To successfully work in mode c) you sketch must initialize Serial to the same baud rate your HC-05 device uses!  The HC-05 baud rate can be set using AT+UART command. I am not sure what value it is reset to by AT+ORGL. The HC-05 command spec I referred above says that it is 38400, but the same spec says that the default value of the baud rate is 9600. In my case, as I received the device, the initial baud rate was 9600.  Note that changing the baud rate settings affects only the rate in mode c) but doesn't affect the rate in this configuration mode b): the last is still 38400 (provided that you switch modes and set jumpers when the power is OFF.) See more details by the link to the spec above.    6) In mode c) you should use the following jumper/switch settings (set them when the power is OFF!):    jumpers: v.1.0: position \\\\\"A\\\\\". v.1.1: position \\\\\"B\\\\\".  switch: position DAT.    This is it. Hopefully I didn't forget something important. Good luck :)",

So I never really got into reading books electronically.  I decided last year to give it a second shot and decided I wanted just an e-reader, so it would be light and easily portable.  I was glad I waited, because the Paperwhite had just been released, and I loved the idea of a built in light for reading in the dark (which I do a lot), but which I could still use for reading in regular light and outdoors, especially at the beach.  I have now read several books on it, and I love that I can take it with me wherever I go, and I have my entire library available to me.  I have pretty much stopped buying hard copies.

Needless to say, this new router was quite the improvement.  I have never had a problem connecting, or staying connecting, with my laptop several rooms away.    All I really needed was an occasional wireless transmitter.  Even with all the security features, I know that no wireless transmitter can be 100% secure.  Plus we are not convinced that sending a wireless signal through the house is completely safe health-wise, especially when this router has to sit on a shelf at head level in the room where I spend most of my time.  I prefer doing most of my computer work on a desktop computer anyway, and only rarely need to connect with my laptop in another room.  So I just wanted a wireless transmitter on the rare occasions when I use my laptop.  I could not find a wireless router that has the option to turn off the transmitter, or at least one that listed that capability.  So my network is made up of two routers.  I have a wired router for a couple of our home desktop computers.  I then plug this wireless router into the wired router only when I want to use the wireless connection for my laptop.  Otherwise the wireless router is unplugged.    This works great for my purposes.  It took quite awhile to set up, though it connected easily the first time.  For some reason, the software that came with it, Linksys Adviser, for managing your computer network was very slow to install.  Plus, after the software was installed, over the next couple of weeks it kept notifying me that I needed to get the updates for the software, even after I downloaded and installed the latest updates.  I couldn't find any way to get it to stop telling me that I needed updates.  So finally I uninstalled the Linksys Adviser software.  The router continues to work just fine without that software!  Plus, I really don't need it for managing my network anyway, as it is really my wired router, not this wireless router, that controls my network.    So I thought the router itself is great!  But I found the software to be lousy and unneeded.",

It's also very stylish.

Sharp, precise and very easy on the eyes. When calibrated and given a suitable display profile It's at least as good as any high end CRT I've looked at and better than most, it was important for me to get the best image quality I could find. The X-174 is very impressive and I have ordered a second one after trying a cheaper LCD... it's really not worth the eyeball pain. <br />I think the only downside is the maximum resolution, 1280 x 1024 can seem small when used to 21\\\\\" monitors running 1600 x 1200.

Because I know that if my phone will fit--in an evening bag, small purse, coat pocket, etc.--then this charger should tuck in nicely, nestled right up against the phone.<br /><br />Having looked at quite a few other chargers, I can say that most work basically the same.  Your main decision you need to make is just how much mAh you need for your particular situation.  This one, at 4000mAh will fully charge your phone one time.  If you need power for standing 24 hours in line waiting for concert tickets or a Black Friday event, you need a much bigger power bank (say 10,000 to 15,000mAh).  If you are going camping out in the wilderness, you need an even bigger power bank (maybe 15,000 to 20,000mAh).  If you are the designated power-holder for the entire family on vacation you need a few big banks to keep up with demand.  At the opposite end, you can find tiny, simple chargers that will give you a burst of emergency power to call home for help.  Those can be the size of a thick business card that fits in your wallet.<br /><br />So, if 4000mAh is the power size you've decided on, you can't go wrong with this charger:  It works well and efficiently.  It is also sharp-looking with its brushed aluminum finish.  The aluminum finish is on the top-side; the bottom is a hard, but rubbery-feel plastic.  Why the four-star, and not a five-star, rating?  While the design is decent, it is not outstanding.  There are some chargers available here on Amazon that will wow you!  This is not one of them.  But if design is not important to you, this is a perfectly fine model.<br /><br />Another plus is that the amount of charge remaining is showed quite clearly in five LED light combinations.  Most other chargers only give you four stages.  With this charger, the LED lights start with a solid red light when it is under 25% charged, the progress through flashing red, flashing red and green, flashing green, then solid green when there is a 96-100% charge.<br /><br />The silky black draw-string pouch is nicely made and will hold the charger, the mini or micro USB cables, and your phone, too (if it's in a minimalist case).<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Arctic.the progress through flashing red, flashing red and green, flashing green, then solid green when there is a 96-100% charge.<br /><br />The silky black draw-string pouch is nicely made and will hold the charger, the mini or micro USB cables, and your phone, too (if it's in a minimalist case).<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Arctic.",

I feel some people are going to think its really neat and others are just going to feel like its an advanced version of stereo.  You have to just test it yourself.  There are supposed to be 5 or more individual speakers in the headphones and the surround sound is not simulated.  The bass levels are not too shabby in my opinion but I dont have any headphones to compare it to because these are my first 5.1 set.  It does not out perform a real sub though but what do you expect?  Where these things kind of disappoint is some of the construction.  The controller piece is alright but it sucks to just let hang on your head so you have to either lay it on your lap, clip it, or deal with it.  There is a light on it too that can be quite bright and annoying so if its near your head its a huge distraction unless I am missing a way to turn it off. I see no switch or option in the software.  I have a buddy that bought them as well and he had to put electrical tape over it just to be able to stand it.  If you try to clip the controller the clip is flimsy and cheap and can break easily.  I have not tested the microphone part of it yet other than levels.  I just use these for 5.1 single player gaming and they seem to do well for that.  The last issue is the driver for the headphones.  It has a program that only starts when it is plugged in which is nice but that software looks like its straight out of windows 95 for some reason.  You'll see what I mean if you use it.  Its just plain ugly.  It lets you get the job done though by adjusting levels of each speaker and changing your environment settings but the way it looks like something from the movie \\\\\"Hacker\\\\\" makes it seem a little shady.  It has some environment settings that are actually pretty funny like making the sound seem under water.  A complete waste of time?  Yup.  Will you ever use them?  No, no you wont.  Oh well.  Anywho go ahead and buy them if you are cheap like me and just want a pair of decent 5.1 headphones.",

This was a good deal for the money and had good ratings, so I decided to try my luck.<br /><br />Installation was easy.  I just followed the steps on the install CD and in less than 10 minutes had a fully functional wireless internet connection.  Its a little faster than the previous wireless router that the cable company had given me and the connection is always great.<br /><br />My only complaint is that if my computer is off for more than 5 or 6 hours, the connection turns itself off (probably actually a good feature), and I have to manually turn it back on, but even that is just a matter of 2 clicks so it's not a big deal - an extra 5 seconds out of my day.<br /><br />It's a secure network with a password so no one else can log into the network but me, and the wireless management software that comes with it remembers all that, so there's no retyping passwords every time I want to log on.<br /><br />All in all, a very satisfying purchase for me and I'd recommend it to anyone.

For $100  or $150 more, you get a inexpensive wireless keyboard & mouse.  What you do get is the HDMI port, which allows you to stream Netflix, Hulu, etc as well as local media files to your HDTV.  The software can be downloaded (Boxee or similar).  The PC can be mounted behind the HDTV.  As a Home Theater PC, it is an exceptional value.  Get your own wireless Keyboard & mouse (MS, Logitech, etc).  You will be happier with the quality & lifespan.  Similarly, a USB DVD is not an expensive item.

I also liked the fold flat earcups as it allows me to carry these in my luggage better when I am on the road. I give 4 stars.

Not sure about the rest of the world.  The PSP uses memory stick duo media for a variety of purposes, most noteably video, music, and game data. <br /> <br />As far as the product, Sandisk products have been great and I've never seen any compatibility issues with Sandisk versus Sony media, so go for the best price.  However, if you have a digital camera that supports high speed transfers, you might want to get the Red Sony High Speed since it supports that high speed transfers.  To my knowledge, only Sony, not Sandisk, makes the high speed transfer version.  However, from what I understand for PSP usage, you do not need the high speed; although, you can use the high speed in a PSP from what I've read.  It could make transfers using a card reader quicker even if not the actual accesses with the PSP.",

They were nice enough to supply me with a sample for test and evaluation, but no worries, I promise that my review is fair and honest (this is not my first product review rodeo!).<br /><br />I've given it a thorough going-over and found much to like.  First, this is the lightest Bluetooth keyboard I've ever seen.  The keyboard weighs just a few ounces; it's so light in fact that it seems almost like a toy.  Yet the advertised battery life is 100 hours working and 100 days standby.  While I didn't try to test either figure (I do have a life, you know), other Anker keyboards I've tested live up to the advertised specs.<br /><br />Secondly, the keyboard attaches to the magnetized cover.  Position it to allow the iPad space to adjust to the desired viewing angle, or remove it entirely.  Use in on your iPad or your cell phone; I tested it successfully on my Galaxy S3, Kindle Fire HDX, and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, all list it as the &#34;Anker Keyboard case for iPad 5&#34; and operates perfectly.<br /><br />Next, the iPad itself fits snugly into a polycarbonate case attached to the Folio.  I really love this feature; I've highlighted it in reviews of other Anker iPad cases.  The case holds the iPad securely - a must considering the cost of the iPad; hold the case at any angle and the iPad remains in place.<br /><br />The Bluetooth connection is easy to set up and remains connected even when the iPad goes to sleep, just hit any key to get things started again.  A simple on/off switch and Connect button are present and the keyboard recharges via a micro-USB cable (provided).<br /><br />Now, I'm not a talented typist, but I found the keyboard a little small; a necessary compromise given the size of the iPad Air.  You are not going to type War and Peace, at least not without getting used to the small keyboard size.  There are, however, a full set of function keys including sound, brightness, and media controls; throw in a lock function, a home key and a few others.  The keys have good travel and are responsive to the touch. In fact, I typed the whole review using the keyboard and the Pages application on my iPad Air.<br /><br />A note of caution; with the keyboard in place the iPad does not turn off when you close the case - the keyboard blocks the magnetized case which turns the iPad off.  Remove the keyboard and close the cover and the iPad powers down.  A magnetized flap closes to secure the cover and folds back when open to stay out of the way.<br /><br />All this at a great price!  Grab one of these and make your iPad more functional.rightness, and media controls; throw in a lock function, a home key and a few others.  The keys have good travel and are responsive to the touch.

The combination provided enough confidence in the quality and suitability of the product to make the purchase.  One reviewer noted that the cover fit \\\\\"to the mm\\\\\", i.e. exactly as it should.  In fact, it does.  So, great fit, high quality leather and workmanship, excellent packaging, immediate follow-up by Bear Motion (to ensure that I was completely satisfied), and several months of very satisfactory daily use are why I give it 5 stars.  (Previously, I bought an expensive vinyl cover for an Ipad 3.  The fit was fine and the swivel and notches for upright use were just right.  But the vinyl has worn unacceptably and proven very disappointing.  I'm looking at a Bear Motion leather cover for it, at the moment. My wife will be pleased.  Of course, being a rather fanatical pro-football fan, she repeatedly asks if she can try my Bear Motion cover on her Ipad 3.  I don't think the cover will fit her Ipad, but I'm not taking a chance that she could force it in.  When it's time, I'll buy her a Bear Motion cover that is guaranteed to fit her Ipad.)    Update:  I have really enjoyed this cover that I paid $49.99 for.  Have enjoyed many compliments on its styling and perceived quality...kudos to Bear Motion Cases.  However, for several months, the \\\\\"strings\\\\\" / laces on the case have become increasingly loose and risk pulling out of the cover with almost any degree of snagging.  If/when that happens, the appearance of the case will degrade rapidly. So, this feels like a significant flaw unless it can be remedied easily.  I have searched for a way to contact Bear Motion about this to no avail.  And I can't find their earlier communication. So, I hope someone from Bear Motion follows this site and can tell me if there is a \\\\\"fix\\\\\" for this problem.  I see that their current Ipad cases don't have the \\\\\"football\\\\\" design, so no more problems with the \\\\\"strings\\\\\" coming unraveled.  That was a good decision.  Wish it had been available when I ordered mine.    2nd Update: I sent an email to ProBiz (as they invite us to do), but no response.  I bought this long enough ago that I know it's beyond any warranty.  But given the ProBiz general model of seeking / responding to feedback / complaints, I expected at least a reply to my concerns.  I expect the time will come when I simply cut the laces off and live with the holes. If I had paid the current price for the case, I might be more tolerant of the product degrading.  But when a company touts the quality of the product and promises a response to concerns, well, I expect both.  Didn't get either.",

There are many people who spend time looking through people's garbage to find personal information.  Once you've had your identity stolen, it's really hard to fix all that.<br /><br />There are two types of popular paper shredders, strip cut and confetti cut paper shredders. This shredder is a confetti cut, also known as cross-cut, and is the most popular type of paper shredder, because they offer a higher level of security. A standard letter size paper is cut into 300-400 small pieces. This makes it difficult to retrieve sensitive information.<br /><br />Most have sensors, so they start shredding when you put a piece of paper in and turn off when it's shredded. If you have kids or pets in the house, it's always best to unplug your shredder when you're not using it.<br /><br />This Aleratec DVD/CD shredder is one of the best I have tried. The shredder came well packaged. Placed in an attractive blue box, the shredder blade portion was well packaged and easy to remove from the package itself. The shredder box and the DVD/CD receptacle were separate and easy to remove. A very informative User Manual was enclosed, along with the Aleratec Registration form and envelope. A shredder lubricant sheet was enclosed, you feed this sheet directly into the shredder. Easy set up, plug the shredder into an outlet. Place the side switch to Auto position, a green LED light comes on and then start shredding. I had 4 advertising pieces of mail in an unopened envelope. Each piece was probably equivalent to four pieces of paper. Went in like a breeze. I don't find the noise at all loud. I do not have any CD's or DVD's to shred at this time.<br /><br />I found this an extremely easy shredder to put together, the users manual was helpful and concise, and most importantly the shredder works very well.  Excellent paper shredder, I will use it often.  A sample was provided for review.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 06-26-14provided for review.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 06-26-14",

I like all my new Apple purchases A LOT!!... the Imac is amazingly fast compared to what I was used to (the old Powerbook G4 1.25 Ghz)... the display is awesome and its huge size allows me to have multiple apps running and displayed without overlapping/hidden windows... I upgraded the RAM to 12 Gig (from Crucial Memory), and bought the magic trackpad (which I am only starting to get used to, and REALLY LIKE IT/haven't been using the magic mouse hardly at all)... I have only just recently finished migrating all my stuff from the Powerbook, and added some graphic/photoEditing/movieAuthoring applications that will show the power of the I5 CPU and 12 Gigs of RAM -- so can't really give a complete evaluation at this point in thyme... the setup was superEZ (typical for Apple products), and I could have used the Apple migration with a firewire to migrate my old account from the Powerbook --> but since the Powerbook was PowerPC based and the Imac is Intel based, didn't want to do that and possibly run into problems with program executable image incompatibilities... Migrating Iphoto and Itunes libraries was a little tricky but there are plenty of tips online on the Internet to assist when I got into a bind...

There is a pocket for the laptop, but I throw so much stuff in all the various pockets when I am in a hurry, I risk placing something that will shift position and end up in the laptop pocket.  The Dell has a beautiful glass-like outer shell and I don't want it scratched by my iPod, cordless mouse, pens, and all the other junk I toss in the bag.    This bag in a bag allows me to easily slip the laptop into it and then place the entire bag in the pocket in my big bag. It never shifts and it is incredibly protective.

The only extras that will fit in the bag is a few USB memory sticks, or a mouse pad, but NOT the power cord or anything else too thick or too large.  If you're looking for a perfect bag, this is it.    Oh, often, when I go to a meeting, the only thing I need is the laptop.  It is so convenient to simply pull this bag out of my big bag and then see my client. When I enter with my laptop in this sleeve, it is impressive, thin, and ultra convenient.    That's my two-cent worth.",

Out of all the keyboards I have ever owned or used, this one is probably the fastest and most responsive that I have ever come across. Its sturdy construction and heavy weight keep it from moving around when weight is applied.  The construction also provides a good amount of shock absorption, which helps avoid fatigue and soreness that you might find from prolonged usage of thinner keyboards.  And the distinct clicking sounds of the keys provide a distinct audio cue that lets you know a key was pressed.<br /><br />The green back lights are a visual delight and they of course compliment any mouse (I.E. The Razer Death Adder) or PC tower (I.E. A black case with green LEDs) that has a similar color scheme. You can adjust the intensity of the lights using the Synapse software or the function keys on the keyboard, which is a nice feature. The function keys also provide you with audio and media control as well as some other keyboard specific commands.  These aforementioned function keys are not absolute necessities, but they are convenient and something you would come to expect from a high end keyboard.<br /><br />The Synapse software for the keyboard provides you with a decent array of options to configure the keyboard.  Its layout and overall visual aesthetic looks a little unpolished when compared to the look and feel of some of the programs you may find for Logitech or other big name peripheral manufactures driver software. This isn't the biggest problem with Synapse however; you will find many complaints across the internet about Synapse wanting you to go online (although there is an option inside of it to go offline).  While I question the practice of Synapse' cloud approach myself,  it isn't the biggest detriment to the BlackWidow.<br /><br />The only true complaint about the BlackWidow that I have is its seemingly unnecessary audio hook ups on the side.  While in practice these are good ideas, the placement of the hook-ups on the right side of the keyboard cause a space problem, especially since my mouse is right next to the right side of the keyboard. And of course, in order for the USB port on the right side of the keyboard to function, you will need to sacrifice an extra USB port.  So the keyboard itself is hurt somewhat by the fact that it requires 2 USB ports (instead of the traditional 1) to fully function.BlackWidow.<br /><br />The only true complaint about the BlackWidow that I have is its seemingly unnecessary audio hook ups on the side.

I'm currently only getting about 13 Mbps. as I work through some router problems and that's why it took that long.   Had a few problems with the HP machine a couple of days after first installing and called Satechi support, was able to cure the problem with the latest driver update.

It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.<br /><br />I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and for not making any special 'claims' as a pretext to charge an inflated price. It's note the absolute cheapest but, being an Amazon brand returning it if it's not what you needed or while under warranty should be as painless as these types of transactions go - I am speaking out of personal experience here.<br /><br />And, YES, it DOES work with the latest Kindle and YES, you can use with with a Blackberry Bold and most smart phones and Bluetooth headsets.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.<br /><br />If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.<br /><br />My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. If in doubt, do some more research or call the maker's tech support.le, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need.

The general setup instructions assume that one is going to use it as an access point, presumably to add wireless access to a non-wireless router or to add N capability to an A, B, or G router.  My only other complaint is that the unit has only a single ethernet port.

I didn't want to spend money on a cheaper wireless mouse because most of the cheaper ones around my local stores were too small. I wanted something that would be comfortable to grip in my hand. I saw this mouse for $29.99 and decided to spend a couple of extra bucks to purchase it.  Now, when I first bought the mouse, I had Windows Vista. I had no problem hooking this mouse up on my laptop. I simply plugged in the usb receiver and could instantly use the device without a problem. When I upgraded to Windows 7, I still had no issues using the mouse.  Someone in another review mentioned the side buttons are easy to hit by mistake. This happens to me a lot. While gripping the mouse, my thumb will sometimes hit one of the side buttons, essentially a back button. It frustrates me when I'm on a page reading something and by accident, hit the side mouse back button. Despite this drawback, I really like having the side buttons on the mouse. It makes it very convenient to go back on one or several web pages without constantly hitting the back button on my web browser all of the time.  When it comes to the cursor when using this mouse, it follows my hand movement almost precisely. The mouse is durable enough to remain still so the cursor isn't constantly shaking as I found with several other wireless mice. I've seen some wireless mice being so sensitive, even the slightest bump from my hand will send the cursor flying all over the screen. Fortunately, this doesn't do that.  I also like the rubber grips on the side. Apart from obviously making the mouse easier to hold, it rests more comfortably in my hand.  And the one other drawback I find with this aside from hitting the side buttons easily by mistake is the usb receiver itself. I've seen newer mice have a shorter length for the usb receiver. As you can see from the picture of this mouse amazon provides, the usb receiver sticks right out when plugged in. I've came close so many times knocking this out of the usb port on my computer and damaging both the port and the receiver. Luckily, this hasn't happened yet. I only wished the receiver was a LOT shorter.    Would I recommend this product? Of course! Just be careful not to hit that usb receiver when it's plugged in, though.",

If you are only gonna use it for general mouse use, this trackball is probably gonna be overkill for you and there are many other cheaper and more practical choices for you. But if you do graphic design, video/photo/music editing, or any other task that has numerous multi key combo commands that you use repetitiously, then this mouse is a must have. It is rather large and seemingly bulky when you first use it, but you soon realize it is for maintaing a fair amount of comfort during long and/or repetitive tasks. The beauty though lies in the program that comes with it allowing full adjustability of all aspects of it. You and adjust speed, sensitivity, and acceleration of the track ball and scroll ring around it. You can program each of the four buttons to tackle six commands, either from a preset, or fully custom key command string or combo. Each button does one command and the top 2 together and bottom 2 together for a total of six. You can also set your choice of &#34;hot keys&#34; on the keyboard to engage effects such as slow(or fine) scrolling and vertical/horizontal scrolling. It has increased my workflow efficiency exponentially. Complex 3 key &#34;Command+Alt+Character&#34; type commands that I use most for a task, become single button clicks saving time and aggravation due to my limited memory ability of commands when swapping from one app to another. My only wish for this mouse is that they would add the ability in the programming software to save different profiles for your most used configurations. But I don't mind to much programming the buttons myself for now and I still give this product a 5 star and recommend it to others who have similar needs of their trackball.",

I can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire?  Well, we're still having our fling.  The ultimate fate of it is yet to be determined.  I want it to be the very sexy iPad.  It seems like it could be.  However, I'm not sure it's even the girl next door.  Compared to the iPad, the Fire is a little temperamental -- the touch recognition isn't quite as polished, and sometimes it does things you don't want or didn't expect.  It's not quite as versatile due to the Amazon store's limited selection of applications.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles and doesn't quite do as much.  Plus, I'm not really the target audience, as I want to fall in love with my girlfriend's iPad but I can't figure out where it fits in my life.<br /><br />Really, that's my primary complaint with the Fire -- where does it fit in my life?  I have a laptop for heavy computing and I have an iPhone for not-so-heavy computing.  Anything I can't do with the iPhone I really need to haul out the laptop to get done.  However, at the price I figured I could take a chance.  $200 goes down a lot easier than $600.  What I've found is that I may not be in love with it, but I don't want to return it either.  It's kind of nice to have a lightweight computing platform I can throw in a (largish) pocket.  It does a lot of things really well, and it's a fantastic media consumption device.  Watching Netflix streaming and Amazon Prime streaming videos has been a joy.  Plus, I found that many apps do exist in other stores, and it's not overly difficult to \\\\\"sideload\\\\\" those applications onto the device.  A little bit of hacking, and this has become a pretty useful and cheap electronic device.<br /><br />I'm not in love, so I can't give it five stars.

First a little note about different versions out there.  You basically want to get one of the three listed below, as they are identical hardware-wise, and differ only in enclosure color/finish:  Samsung N150-JP05 - Black Matte (the one I got)  Samsung N150-JP06 - Blue Matte  Samsung N150-JP07 - Glossy Black    They all come with the new version of the atom chip - N455, which differs from previous N450 processor by supporting DDR3 memory.  The netbook comes with 1GB of DDR3 memory installed already and you can upgrade up to 2GB (just keep in mind there is only one memory slot, so you need to buy 2GB).    I was looking for a way to read pdf books in bed (a lot of software/engineering books are written in that format).  I was hoping I could use my Kindle for that, but sadly, while great for fiction, Kindle was a big let-down when it came to pdf reading.  Not only do you have to jump through hoops to convert pdfs to mobi format, but the end result often misses pictures/graphs/tables and is not searchable.  This is where I got an idea to use a netbook, and it surpassed my expectations.    I was initially planning on buying an Asus, from Eee series, but luckily enough, a coworker already went that route, and was thoroughly disappointed.  Asus machine was loud, was getting very hot, and had a reflective screen.  My coworker promptly returned it, and bought the Samsung instead.  After I got a chance to look at it at work, I immediately ordered mine.  This notebook is quiet, doesn't run hot, and most importantly is perfect for reading due to matte screen.  You don't get that annoying shiny reflection (I don't understand why manufacturers insist on making glossy displays - they are unusable).    The notebook comes with Windows 7 Starter, and 1 Gb of RAM.  It runs fast enough when it comes to typical daily tasks, like browsing the web, reading PDFs and checking email.  I am actually planning to install Visual Studio on it, and see if it can handle it.  Will update the review when I do.    It is capable of playing Netflix if you have the streaming plan.  I did see it drop a couple of frames every now and then, but it's not a big deal.  I'm sure I can improve the performance by removing all useless processes running in the background.    This series is very popular - and stores constantly run out of stock.  Amazon used to sell these for 299, but now it's over 300.  Do a little search online, and you can easily find a deal for 280 or less.  J&R Electronics just had these on sale the other day.    If you have any specific questions, ask in comments - I'll be sure to respond.    UPDATE 05/01/2011:  I just ordered 2GB RAM for the netbook - to save you time searching for the proper type here's the link to the compatible one:  [[ASIN:B001KB6Z2U Crucial CT25664BC1067 2GB 204-PIN PC3-8500 SODIMM DDR3 Memory Module]]  Visual Studio 2010 express runs fine on the netbook.    I did notice a bit of stutter playing Netflix.  It would mostly happen when the netbook was unplugged.  After going through settings I realized when the netbook is unplugged it tries to save battery life by throttling cpu and display performance.  You can adjust those settings inside Power Management options.  If you see a performance problem, that disappears when you plug the laptop in - chances are you can fix it there.",

The thing that you need to consider if you are looking for the same is that you really need to find the proper synergy between BOTH stylus and App. Especially when you are considering these active stylii that pair with the app, you need the app to support the sdk provided by the stylii manufacturer.<br /><br />Last year I settled on this Jot Script and the Goodnotes app. I primarily value a pairing that allows me to use it like a journal, and this pair works brilliantly. Initially the offset and lag of the Script did not allow for writing full screen with any precision, but over time both the SDK and the app have developed and now it works passably for full-screen note-taking, especially with the latest iOS update which supports the best palm rejection I have yet seen. Using the zoom box for writing is my preferred mode (even when I have a precise stylus - I actually think this is an improvement of pen and paper) and the Script works great for this. I have found that the currently best solution is to either pair the stylus with Goodnotes and use the Goodnotes Palm Rejection (which makes for more precision at the tip) or to just not pair the stylus at all (which I find has good enough precision and a bit less lag).<br /><br />This is still not a perfect device, but overall it is the best of the many options I have tried.

I work with Adobe design programs, so I dump all but a few of the panels onto the Lenovo (see pic), leaving a large, uncluttered design space on the laptop (I configure custom 'workspaces' inside Adobe).  (NOTE: if using a Mac, you need to download the Lenovo driver from displaylink.com.)  For the most part I've been loving it, it's been a godsend. Text and images are crisp. The anti-glare screen is a big plus. I would not use it as a main graphics screen, however. At maximum brightness the screen is noticeably dimmer than the maximum brightness of the MacBook Pro's screen, not a big drawback for my purposes, but it makes for dull colors, and there is a yellowish tint, impossible to correct. There are no color settings. When I bought it I paid a total of $165, not sure I would pay the $300 it's listed for now.  People commented on having trouble with the cover, I don't know why. If you grab one corner and pull up, it's easily removed. The newer ones slide on.  THE REASON FOR DROPPING ONE STAR After 2 years, the monitor suddenly wouldn't power on. I contacted Lenovo directly. GREAT customer service. I was told it actually had a 3-year warranty\u2014almost unheard of, RIGHT? They promptly replaced it (although with a factory refurbished one). BUT THEN, the same thing happened to the 2nd one after less than a year. I contacted Lenovo again, and again they replaced it, to their credit, although this time it was more difficult, since it turned out that the serial number of the refurbished one wasn't in their system. After 2 HOURS on the phone and my having to send them a pic of the serial number, it got straightened out.  Don't know if I'm correct, but I've concluded that THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE USB CORD'S BEING LOOSE where it connects to the monitor. My guess is it eventually tore wires inside the Lenovo. So, I decided to affix the cord semi-permanently but securely with a glob of silicone (I didn't want to use anything more liquidy that might seep into the connection). It's not pretty (see pic), but I don't care. Hopefully the monitor will now last for years.",

A+ there too.<br />To the product - It's a little small for the eyes of an old(er) man, but I can zoom quickly, so I can live with it. The same thing that makes it a little rough on the eyes makes it a dream to carry/lift. It's sitting next to my 15.6&#34; Acer. It feels like it weighs less than half that. Pretty sweet. The battery has never been an issue for me either. The instant startup is awesome, I must say. They say it takes 7 seconds. It's never taken more than 4. Compare that to my Acer at 30 seconds plus, and then I have to wait for it to find the wifi - I find myself picking up the chromebook more and more. Storage can be interesting. Photos still go on my &#34;real&#34; computer as that has the space. I'm not paying extra for cloud storage, so that's what I'll have to do for now. Also, I'm not a big gamer anymore so I'll be okay without the latest edition of &#34;Knights of the Old Republiic&#34;.  The audio is about what you'd expect. Meh. Bluetooth works like a charm though. Finally, the keyboard layout is a little... compressed. Again, you get used to it.<br />And finally the software - It's my first time using Chrome OS and was pretty intuitive and speedy, especially if you're used to other OS's AND have a google account. I've had no problems at all with speed on Netflix, youtube, etc, and it works great with my Chromecast. One weird thing is that even setting the mouse at full speed, it moves slower than on my Windows computer. You get used to it, but I could see it bugging someone who was playing a speed-click game. Google works just fine for docs, spreadsheets, etc. So it would be good for schoolwork too.<br /><br />I'm sure I've forgotten a few things, but you get the idea.<br />Is it perfect for me? It's pretty darn good, but not quite. A 14&#34; would be great, both for screen size and keyboard spacing. But the bigger ones jump like mad in price, so, no thanks, not yet. Am I glad I bought it? Definitely. Would I recommend it to others? Definitely so, but only after they read this and a few other reviews to be sure its limitations won't be too much of a pain, or at least don't outweigh the benefits. It's not for everyone, but it would be plenty for many. It's a great backup (almost first) computer. It would make a great schoolwork computer for kids and even college students.

The power supply included with the package is garbage, and doesn't actually provide enough power to boot the Pi (It will give you an error message until you switch to a decent adapter or plug it into another PC for USB power.)<br /><br />The clear case looks nice, but is a little too tight. I felt like I was going to break the tiny Pi trying to pry the case open enough to slot it in properly.<br /><br />The little breakout board could be better replaced by the T-Cobbler from adafruit which has the pins set up in such a way that their labels don't get covered by the wide grey cable. Better for prototyping and learning IMHO.<br /><br />Hopefully this info helps the seller improve, or gives others proper warning of what they are in for.",

In my opinion this laptop blows my newer Inspiron 1318 out of the water.    First off the computer is super light, you can stick it in your bag and take it wherever you want while not giving yourself major back pains.  Secondly the performance on this machine is awesome and it is very powerful.  I am able to run newer games such as Doom 3, Quake 4 and Resident Evil 4 on here without any problems or lockups.  Conversely my newer Inspiron 1318 which is supposed to be upgraded and more modern wont play ANY of these games.  This laptop is super fast, it is great for general use, school work, buisness and gaming.  Not only do I use it for gaming, I use it for research and projects for my graduate classes as well as for running my buisness.      I only have 2 minor complaints about this computer.  The first is that the glossy screen does not work so well outside and the outdoor glare is a killer, but that is easily avoided by replacing the screen for a matte version.  Secondly the wireless card is not exactly the fastest at long range, but this can be easily avoided by getting a wireless expander or an addition pcie wireless card such as the one I use by NetGear.  This is a great windows XP computer, soon I am going to try to upgrade it to Windows 7, and if that works correctly than it is a wrap, i'll get a second one!!    Just a warning, dont drop the computer too many times, since it is smaller, the screen is quite a bit more deliciate than most laptop screens, although the laptop is built like a tank, and god knows mine has taken a beating, the screen is a little delicate.  I dropped mine a cracked the LCD screen, but replacement parts for it are easy to find and the screen is super easy to install.  Secondly, you dont want to drop it too much becuase this model was one of the ones with the exploding batteries.  While mine did no such thing, there were stories of it happening but Dell has since replaced the batteries and offered all owners new batteries, so this should not be an issue, it is just a quick heads up.  (the battery only exploded if it was dropped and it fell on the battery).      This had to be the best laptop I ever bought.  I got this when it was very expensive, and to see it on here for cheap is like a dream come true.  I have had mine going on almost 10 years now, and it is still kicking and has not stopped working!  When mine finally does decide to die, I am going to pick up another used one from here, that is how much I love this laptop.  Forget the new stuff, this one is great and a real workhorse! By the way, get the laptop here the price on here is amazing, I paid over $1000 for it when it first came out, and it was the best money I ever spent!",

Before I was using the stock cooler and ran Prime 95 on my i7 930 with no overclocking and all stock BIOS settings. At 100% load, Prime 95 gave me 93 degrees C (using Realtemp). Yikes! I stopped the program so that it won't fry my i7 930. After installing the Hyper N520 and running Prime 95, the temperature was at around 70 degrees C with no overclocking. Then overclocked to 3.5 GHz with a max CPU core temperature around 76 degrees C. I'm quite surprised. An overall 20 degrees drop in temperature. Cool is good.    The fans are quite quiet even running at 100%. I had it set for manual to run at 100% no matter what.     One drawback is that you would need to take the motherboard out and install it on the outside. It is quite possible to install it without the motherboard taken out. You would need a clamp or an extra pair of hands to hold the cooler in place while another person turns the nuts on the backside of the motherboard. I do agree the instructions are horrible. But if you know what you are doing then you probably won't need it. The diagram for the direction of the air flow is wrong on the illustration. You would need to look at the fans to figure out the directions.     A good cooler for a decent price. There are probably better coolers out there but are larger and more expensive.

I travel with two gripped Canon bodies, at least 5 lenses (One being a 70-200L), flashes and light modifiers, batteries and chargers, filters, manuals, my laptop and it's charger, along with various other accompaniments.  I even, remove the internal camera compartment, and place my shooter's vest in flat, and easily replace the compartment.  This case is tough and very well built.  It makes organizing your equipment extremely easy.  What I really appreciate is that even though I've carried all I described, I still have room for more.    As you may be able to guess, with all I have to carry, this can get to be quite heavy.  The rolling wheels make this a dream.  I simply extend the handle and zip right along through airports with no problems.  Removing the computer compartment and re-attaching it is fairly easy.  Meaning, it's not exactly a one handed job, but it's not difficult and time consuming.  It makes storing the pieces very easy.

I read a lot of reviews and everyone more or less seemed to agree that Kindle PaperWhite is the best eReader out there (for its money), and since I spend A LOT of time reading daily, I decided to buy one to replace my old device. Well, I own one for only 3 days, but I'm currently regretting my choice and this is why:<br /><br />Kindle PW is indeed the best (probably) eReader out there in those three cases:<br />-You are a new reader or own only a few ebooks already<br />-You already own a ton of books bought from Amazon<br />-or you're simply not a fanatic reader (=spending more than an hour daily to read)<br /><br />In my case where after 5 years of owning a Sony eReader I've managed to collect over 800 ebooks -obviously not from Amazon's site since it doesn't support the ePUB fromat that this reader featured- the Kindle is more or less a bad choice for me. My main problems are:<br />-I used Calibre to organize my books in collections because with 800+ books, you have to keep them separated by themes/groups else you can't find anything. Unfortunately, the Collections from Calibre do not apply in the Kindle; I have to manually make new Collections on my Kindle and -also manually- add the books in them from the kindle. For so many books, this is simply not practical nor is the choice of emailing 800+ books to my device so they get added to the cloud and then to my device. Not to mention I'm not a fan of cloud saving options; as a software programmer, I'm a bit sceptical that this is a perfectly good way for someone to keep tabs on you and I'd hate that.<br />-The kindle keeps your reading location ONLY for the last book read. In my case where I usually read more than 2-3 books at a given time, the kindle only keeps the location of the last book opened. I guess this wouldn't be a problem if I had the WiFi turned on all the time and the books were synchronized by WhisperSync. Unfortunately, I live in Greece and as strange as it may sound to some people, WiFi is NOT always available here so this is not an option for me. Weirdly enough, the Sony eReader which was 5 years old, managed to do that without the need for a WiFi.<br />-Also, because I read more than one book at a time, I have a problem with the &#34;Recent&#34; sorting. When I add new books to my reader, only the last book I opened stays on the home screen as recent; the other couple of books I was also reading along, get pushed behind the last added books and I have to search for them again. Well, Sony solved this 'problem' simply by having two different sorting options: Last Added and Last Read which worked -again- much better than the kindle.<br />-Ok, I'm used to the Sony after 5 years, but I can't help noticing that there is just no option of adjusting the weight of the fonts on the kindle, as opposed to the Sony (and the Kobo as far as I know). This can be annoying, since the new &#34;Bookerly&#34; font, while otherwise great, needs a bit more weight for my taste, but since I can't change that, I'm stuck with Caecilia.<br />-The PDFs display badly as opposed to the Sony. I can only zoom in but cannot increase/decrease the font size which for documents (=text, not drawings) just doesn't work.<br /><br />When you have opened a book, the screen is very good, the lighting works perfectly and the touch response is excellent; no complaints about the reading experience so far. But, if you like me have an extensive collection of ebooks bought outside Amazon, I would not recommend this eReader. In fact, I'm already saving money to buy myself a Kobo.as it may sound to some people, WiFi is NOT always available here so this is not an option for me.

After purchasing iRacing.com's product, I found that such a wheel was not up to the standards of the simulated race experience.  So, I saved up and purchased the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel.  Let me tell you this, the difference is AMAZING!  There are tons of great things I can say about this, but I will spare you that for now and get straight to what you will want to know - the cons.      Logitech does not con you with this product, but there are a few pitfalls.  Straight away, you will have to 4 chords to manage.  They could have put it all into 2, but they gave us 4.  But once you work out a system, or get one of those nice wire management foam/plastic shells you're good.  The other pitfall is that you might want to work out your arms and shoulders some before getting this!  It only can put out a max of 3NM of torque, but trust me those 3NM of torque will tire you out quick if you're not used to such harsh reality.  In real life driving wheels can be subject up to and beyond 10NM of torque!  (that's more than enough to break fingers and possibly arms, if not injure you!), but you're safe with this product from any injury as long as you keep ergonomics in mind.  Also, at first, with such torque at the wheel you will want to make sure to take frequent breaks.  You won't believe how fast this wheel (when set to realistic specs of 102% overall effect in the window's control interface, and the default of 16FFB in iRacing.com's settings if you're getting it for that) can tire you out!    *****BUT*****      Here's the great things about this product from logitech!      This wheel is the closest you're going to get to the real thing for under 300 bucks!  Amazon provides a great discount here.      Once this is set up, you can set it and forget it (for a while, EVERY wheel needs recalibration here and there, even the best).    It's the most solid build you'll find.  It's even quieter with helical cut gears!      You get 3!  YES 3! Pedals.  Clutch!, break and throttle.  Does it get better than this in simulated racing?  I mean it's pedals are covered in REAL STEEL!  The wheel's frame seems to be steel too!  The pedals' base even comes with 3 ways to keep it from moving, hard mounting (screwing into place on say something like a Playseat, can I advertise for them enough?), rubber feet for hardwood floors, and even spikes at the back than can be pulled down to keep it from moving AT ALL on carpet!  (And such great design there!  It won't move, nor damage your carpet/rug!)  Can I say enough about these pedals?  I think not!        It's accessability is rated 4 just for the amount of chords and the time you'll have to take to set it up in windows and in your various games/sims (which shouldn't take THAT long ;) ).      It's comfort is second to none!  It's genuine leather they wrapped it in!  (though, it has a lot of torque, you get used to it once it's set to you're preference and you give it time)      Speed of this wheel is incredible... it can't be turned faster than real life would allow, unless you turn down/off the forced feedback (FFB).  With FFB turned off, it's like driving a Cadillac, or so I've heard.       You can't get much more real, nor can you get much of a better feel than this... real steering wheels are bigger, but you don't need it really.      It's immersion is second only to the real thing.      Ergonomics... GREAT!, IF AND ONLY IF you keep in mind where you are supposed to keep your hands and take frequent breaks!  Otherwise you could injure yourself.  This is professional level simulation here.  But if you keep correct positions and breaks in mind, this wheel will not injure you.  It's like anything else out there.      Cable management could have been better, but they do give you some stuff to help out with the 4 chords they give you.  4 groves to places them inso they don't get pinched and before that a place to wrap excess cable around.      Overall, this is the best product you can get for your money (unless that elusive G29 ever comes out, ROFLMAO).  There are more expensive products out there, but you will pay much more for them!  You can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a real simulator, tens of thousands on the lesser equivalent that doesn't move but will give you feedback in the pants in the form of knocks and vibrations and good sound/visuals, 500 USD or more for over-the-top reproductions of this wheel, or you can get the original!  The logitech G27 Racing Wheel for the pc is THE BEST  wheel you will ever get, without paying too much.  Some would say 250 USD is too much, but trust me.  You get everything you pay for, and THEN SOME!      **Oh, and one last thing, make sure if you're doing your sim racing on a desk (as opposed to the Playseat also available on Amazon), that the desk isn't a cheapie!  This thing will have your desk and everything on it bouncing (and possibly breaking), including that expensive HD monitor you payed a lot more for ;).  (But don't worry too much here, I haven't bolted anything down and have yet to have anything break or fall) Otherwise I'd recommend bolting down everything that's loose, or at the very least duct-taping it all down!  I'm being serious here, that wheel has a ton of force in it.  When Logitech call it \\\\\"force feedback\\\\\"  they mean it has FORCE!  3NM of torque, that is a TON of force for a gaming/siming race wheel!**",

From standard cable TV input, it gives a MUCH better picture than my mid-priced 13 inch TV that is next to the computer. <br /> <br />Mechanically / electronically, it is pretty decent for the price. The only quibble I have in that respect is that you have to run a seperate audio line to your sound card, rather than everything going through USB (maybe this improves data flow, but it is a minor irritation for me.) <br /> <br />The software and drivers is where this really disappoints. Installed on two different systems, it gave lots of trouble on both: <br /> <br />On the laptop (Sony Vaio GRV550 2.4Ghz, 512 RAM, XP Home SP1) the drivers gave me \\\\\"Blue Screen Of Death\\\\\" on an otherwise absolutely stable system several times before I finally managed to get it to work.  Once installed and sort of debugged, video worked fine, but audio would cut out completely after 10 to 30 seconds, no matter how you had it set. I had to to close the program and reopen to get another few seconds of sound. (I solved this problem by buying an external Soundblaster USB sound processor, which the KWORLD tuner liked a lot more than my internal Yamaha soundcard.) <br /> <br />I still get a \\\\\"cannot create shell notification\\\\\" error when Windows first starts (I think this is probably from the PVR Plus application) but after clicking \\\\\"OK\\\\\" everything seems to work as it should. <br /> <br />The newest driver downloaded from the manufacturer's site was even more buggy on the laptop than the one that came with the device. I must have gotten 7 \\\\\"BSODs\\\\\" before I gave up and went back to the older drivers. <br /> <br />On the desktop (Homebuilt, AMD 3200 running @ 2.1 Ghz on a Chaintech 7NIL1 MOBO, 1 Gig RAM, XP home SP2, completely fresh OS and program install with all the latest direct-X, encoder and Media Player 10 downloads and patches) the newer driver installed OK, and the problem with the sound cutting out from the laptop install was not encountered. <br /> <br />On BOTH systems, recording through the included interface (TVR) in either MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 brought several different DLL related errors when you tried to stop recording. (Have to hit Ctl-Alt-Del several times to end the program to get out. (However, that doesn't mess up your recording, so I suppose one could live with it.) MPEG-4 (with Divx codec) and AVI recording work without those DLL errors upon closing, (although AVI gives you HUGE files) I didn't try recording at the DVD, VCD or SVCD settings, so can't say if they work or not. <br /> <br />On BOTH systems, using the included recording interface, there was a distinct audio lag on anything recorded in any of the MPEG formats(1,2 or 4) , and the longer the recording, the farther the audio got behind, Record a 90 minute movie, and by the end, the audio track would be three minutes behind. <br /> <br />However, I lucked out and discovered that the free Windows Movie Maker works perfectly with the KWORLD USB2.0 Video Capture on both of my computers. No audio lag, no crashes when you stop recording, and the .wmv format gives you sharper video and much smaller file sizes than Mpeg 1 or 2. If you need MPEG format, record them through Windows Movie Maker and convert them through Win-Avi or one of the other converters. I've even recorded some broadcast TV to WMV, converted to MPEG1, and run that through Kinoma Producer to play it on a Palm. <br /> <br />The DVD / VCD recording program in the NERO Suite also works well with the KWORLD tuner if you have a lot of empty hard drive space to fill. <br /> <br />Several other people on another site have given the software and drivers a high rating, and video quality a lower rating, so my experiences in installing on two different systems with similar results and difficulties may be the exception. <br /> <br />(Hint: disable Spybot S&D before attempting to install, if you have it on your system. It won't make it easy, but it will help a lot).",

Second, it's fairly easy to put on and take off. I also like the fact that the Apple logo shines through the case when the computer is on, and not visible when the computer is off or in sleep mode.<br /><br />Now for the cons. As the case fits on easily, it seems the plastic wasn't cut right in certain places so it looks a little &#34;off&#34;.

How it affects your reading depends on your other settings. I like black background with white lettering. For this setting it doesn't do much to improve my reading experience in sunlight. It's a little more effective if you have white/beige background and black lettering though.<br /><br />There is something about the matte finish that is appealing to me, it just feels nice. Some screen covers reduce the sensitivity of your touch but this one doesn't seem to which is a big plus. You don't get fingerprints on it but you still get smudges unfortunately.<br /><br />One big big big flaw in it that makes me want to try another one is that it gets permanent marking really easily. By that I mean like if something hits the screen, it'll create a visible \\\\\"dent\\\\\" on the screen. With my old screen cover I would throw my Kindle without the protective case in my bag and take it out just fine.

I needed the Google authenticator, or cell phone to get my google codes - now all I do is plug in the Security key. I did have an issue registering it with Google, but that was my fault. It does state you need Chrome version 38. I was using my Asus Chromebox which only has version 36 so every time I tried and register my key, it would time out. I then used my desktop computer which is running Chrome version 38 and everything went perfectly. You do have the option to use the Google Authenticator , codes or cell phone if your device does not have a thumb drive or you don't have your Security Key with you . - One real safeguard is that if you happened to land on a fake Google site through Phishing, the security key will NOI allow your codes to be transmitted -it knows if you are trying to log into a fake site.

So I just run the built in recovery program and it sets the whole system back to brand new automatically.  All of my own files are still there safe and sound on the D drive.       You can find instructions on how to set up a partition on Google.  It's like 3 steps.  Running the recovery is also easy.  I've done the same thing for a friend who has an Acer desktop.      Acer computers are really just clean and solid: with a lot less trial-programs to plug up the system.  I simply remove the included antivirus program and anything else I don't plan to buy using a program called Revo Uninstaller, and then I install a free Antivirus program called Avast: I find it to be much more reliable and faster than the famous programs.

I used a Macbook Pro until now (which had - after < 2 years of use - enough bugs for 3 laptops - fan out of control, cd/dvd drive broken, etc.), and I dont regret switching to the W520 (I own a W520 for a month now). I am doing a lot of Matlab image processing on my laptop, and the performance as well as screen resolution / quality is great (upon purchase, Lenovo lets you choose between 3 different screens with different maximum resolutions - i chose the highest resolution - 1920 X 1080; also they let you choose between 2 different gpus). One unique thing to mention is that you have full control over which graphics processor (integrated vs. Nvidia gpu) your laptop uses when, and for which application separately - i think this is kind of new and unique.  The only thing that bothered me initially was Lenovo's trackpad, which doesnt come close to the comfort of my Macbook pad. Normal cursor control is ok, but e.g. two-finger scrolling is almost impossible. After my initial disappointment,  I got really hooked to using the red lenovo track point. It takes one to two days to get used to it, but once you have the hang of it, it's much more convenient for cursor control, scrolling (instead of 2 - finger scrolling, one uses the middle button above the trackpad), etc. than the track pad. So - no complaints there. And if you want to do e.g. technical drawing, you may want to use a mouse in any case...  One thing more that took me a bit of patience to figure out was the fact that - by default - the operating system shuts down and 'unmounts' the physical cd drive when not in use. This is a good feature as it helps saving energy. However, it interferes with the installation and usage of virtual drives (e.g. Daemon tools). Anyway, I figured out that you can easily disable this CD drive - auto-shutdown option. So - if you have the money - stop looking. This is your machine.",

I've always worried about frying the processor and was excited to see this cooling pad. It comes in a clean, sleek white box that is easy to open. The cooling pad has a USB cord to attach to your laptop and works essentially as a plug and play. It's incredibly easy to use and foolproof. There are instructions but it's very obvious. There are some requirements as far as OS but I don't really see why.<br /><br />The cooling pad does expand and supposedly it's meant to fit every type/size of macbook. I own a 17 inch Macbook Pro and my laptop was MUCH bigger than this cooling pad. The macbook extended over the sides of the cooling pad in every direction and there was no real stability keeping the macbook on the cooling pad. There are 2 rubber stoppers  that are meant to keep the laptop attached (I think) but my laptop slide over these constantly. So it was difficult to accurately use the cooling fan since the laptop wouldn't sit on top unless it was on the table or on my lap.<br /><br />The fans are rather weak and didn't actually give any great air flow/cooling to the laptop when the cooling fans were sitting on the table (for stability) or on my lap. The laptop didn't seem to cool much when the pad was plugged in and on. I did notice that when using the cooling pad that the battery life of the laptop dropped substantially so it was only really viable to use if/when the laptop is plugged into a charger.<br /><br />Additionally the entire unit is very lightweight and feels flimsy. I'd be worried about easy breakage if traveling with the unit.<br /><br />Overall since the cooling pad doesn't fit my 17 inch macbook nor does it really cool it noticeably - in combination with the other concerns such as flimsy material and battery draining power - the pad ultimately isn't really useable.

It was much more precise (you use your fingers instead of your arm/wrist), it doesn't accidentally jigger the cursor when you let go of it, it doesn't run out or real estate (even on your knee), it doesn't need a special mouse pad, etc. The only thing I missed was a scroll wheel (I don't like thumb-based trackballs).<br /><br />Last year I bought a MacBook Pro and it had a trackpad like all laptops nowadays. I usually give new trackpads a try for a couple of days before I get disappointed and run back screaming to my trusty trackball. I must have used close to two dozen trackpads over the years and all were lacking or unusable, but this one, wow, this one was something else!<br /><br />When I saw that you can get an external trackpad that is even larger than the built-in MBP trackpad, I was so there!<br /><br />The Magic Trackpad is basically like an iPad touch surface for your computer. It has all the trackball advantages I listed above, plus many things you can't do with either a trackball or a mouse. For instance:<br />- try rolling instead of swiping your finger for even more precision<br />- you can scroll freely in all directions, not just vertically and in notched steps like a scroll wheel<br />- it has gestures that are actually helpful!<br /><br />Using this trackpad has increased my productivity. Some of that is probably part of OS X. For instance, I haven't used scrollbars since I started using a Mac. I also like to use multiple desktops, so changing between them with a simple gesture is just awesome.<br /><br />If you are not happy with your mousing performance, or are ready to step up your game from a trackball, get the Magic Trackpad and be happier!",

No touchscreen issues as of yet, like the first one. It is a bit heavy and hard to handle so I have ordered the Velcro tablet holder for hand here on amazon. It looks like it can handle the weight pretty easy. I noticed I couldn't delete the kid apps, this tab is for me not a child. I downloaded ram booster on play store and it has an app deleter in settings, and I was able to remove them that way. It helps clear up extra memory. I put in a 32gb Samsung sd card and it read it perfectly and plays all my movies on there too. The only MAJOR downfall, is that even with the front facing speakers; movies, videos and music are so quiet, you have to hold it up to your ear. I definitely recommend this tablet, but you had better purchase a Bluetooth speaker or headphones with it. The sound is terribly disappointing. And I mean terrible! So I was going to raise from 1 star to 5, but I had to drop a star for sound. If possible I would have dropped 1 and 1/2 stars, but amazon doesn't allow that. I just can't believe they did such a great job on this tablet and basically ruin it with the speakers. If it wasn't for the speakers, this tab could have competed with a Samsung tab. It could have also used dual band WiFi, but not a deal breaker, and I don't really need nfc with a tablet this size anyway.<br /><br />Update: I have ordered a replacement, so my review may possibly change .<br /> Bought mine from qvc, it was really great for the first day, then the touchscreen quit working. Did hard reset, everything I could, but nothing. Good luck with customer support, and When you do get help they don't speak very good English, so it went back.",

The build quality is good for the price and I had no problem connecting it to two different devices.  It fits my Nexus 7 like a glove and it looks great.  The rubberized backing is very similar to the back of the Nexus, just a little more slick (if that makes sense).  The angle that the Nexus 7 sits at in the keyboard is nice.  Don't expect to use this on your lap though, as the small size makes it difficult to keep stable.

My first cooler (a very generic Chinese design with two fans) was very quiet, but flimsy; both fans died within the first 30 minutes of operation. I exchanged it for another of similar design; it was noisier, but still too flimsy for in-lap used, so I gave it to my daughter, whose laptop is generally used on a desk.<br /><br />The Belkin is much more substantial and, I like the fact that its single fan is in the middle, where it sucks air between my slightly parted legs. At first, I was not enamored of the curved design (which will not sit stably on a flat surface), But I realized that it promotes very good airflow under the computer, directed straight at the hottest part of the Acer's underside, an area without vents. With the cooling pad, the underside of the Acer is actually cool to the touch -- a very effective job of cooling. Extending the folding support tilts the pad and computer to an angle that makes laptop typing more comfortable. I also appreciate the fact that edge of the pad closest to my body is somewhat padded, providing a bit of a wrist wrest.<br /><br />Too soon to comment on reliability, but the Belkin pad is much more substantial than other designs that I have seen, which sacrifice stiffness for a thin profile. With a quieter fan, I would have given the Belkin 4, perhaps 5 stars. The fan isn't excessively noisy, and is inaudible when used outdoors, or with background music, but it's far from silent, and is quite noticeable in a quiet environment.",

This laptop has essentially replaced my computing needs on-the-go. Excel and One-note files open flawlessly within less than a second's time, this just saves a ton of time if you do loads of presentations. This also means you may need, as I have done, to buy the UDP2HDMI converter. These attachments work very well when needed. I would have appreciated if they could have included a HDMI port directly instead since it is a standard with most outputs nowadays anyways.<br /><br />Overall a very very good buy, I am very happy with the product.

The 2-year Extended Warranty is just that, a 2-year warranty. Why do I say that when the unit has a 1-year warranty on it? Some think that it should total 3 years but that is wrong. The warranty for the unit says this..\\\\\"This limited warranty applies only to hardware components of the Device that are not subject to accident, misuse, neglect, fire or other external causes, alterations, repair, or commercial use\\\\\". It doesn't cover any accident damage. So if you drop the unit and it cracks the glass then that would not be covered under warranty even if you have used the unit one day. Taking it out of the box if you break it then it would not be covered. But with the Extended Warranty if you drop it or spill coffee on it and fry the unit then it will be replaced for free. So bottom lines is this, the extended warranty is a good idea. They should not of used the word \\\\\"Extended\\\\\" and just said 2-year warranty or insurance.<br /><br />Look at it this way, you have a new car warranty that come with the purchase of a new car but if you don't have full coverage insurance and if you are in an accident the new car warranty will not replace or repair your car. The 2-year extended warranty for the Kindle is the full coverage insurance for it.<br /><br />Hopefully I will not need to use the warranty, but for 2 years if my wife throws it at me and it breaks then I can get it replaced using the warranty for free.

It took some getting used to at first. Works fine except that the pen nib rattles a little and didn't seem sturdy. I switched to markers after a while working with this tablet, and used it more as a mouse pad. When I picked up the pen again after setting it aside a while without using, it stopped working. (I changed new batteries). Don't know why, but I guess it's just being upset that I don't like it as I did before.  It's good for the price, but if you work a lot with digital tablets, or if you expect something that lasts, I would suggest you invest money into something more expensive and has a better quality than this tablet.",

            "input": "This product had great reviews on Amazon, and its promised features at a low price warranted those reviews.  But the actual product I received did not live up to expectations, perhaps because the product works great in some computer configurations but not others.      Specifically, the product packaging said the product was compatible with Windows 7.  But I found out that wasn't the case.  The product comes with a disk with many drivers on it, including drivers for 32 and 64 bit versions of Vista.  But there were no drivers for Windows 7.  I also checked the company's website.  While it had all the drivers on the disk shipped with the product, it also did not have Windows 7 drivers.  I tried installing the relevant Vista drivers on two machines 1) a 64 bit desktop running Window 7 Home Premium (with the drivers on the disk), and 2) a 32 bit ultraportable (a type of Netbook with more memory and a faster processor than a typical Netbook) running Windows 7 Home Premium (with the drivers downloaded from Diamond's website).  In both cases, my installer said the drivers were incompatible with the Windows 7 Home Premium operating system.    I figured that I might well be overlooking something.  After all, many Vista drivers are compatible with the Windows 7 Home Premium operating system.  Moreover, one of the Amazon reviewers for this product stated, incidentally to his review, that the product worked fine on his Windows 7 computer.  I remain open to the possibility that the version of the product I got is compatible with Windows 7 in at least one configuration.    Based on such a theory, I went to Diamond's website and found its support section.   As is often the case, there was no telephone number to call for tech support.  No problem, I'm used to that.  I saw no articles in the knowledgebase on Windows 7 compatibility for this particular product, so this left me with two options: submit a ticket (via a web form) or chat with an online representative.  All this looked very professional, and I was suitably impressed.  I started by submitting a ticket.  Before I would be done about two weeks later, I would have submitted four of them--none receiving any reply.    Here they are:    May 21, 2010.   I purchased the HD750 to work with my Acer Windows 7 netbook. The netbook has no DVD slot, so I went to your website to download the driver. Your website offers no Windows 7 driver for the HD750, despite the fact that the box says the product works on the Windows 7 operating system. When I seek to download the second best alternative, the driver for the 32 bit Vista version, I get a fatal error message midway through installation. I have done this a half dozen time and get the error message each time. It appears to me that the Vista 32 bit version of your product won't work with my Windows 7 netbook, but I hope you'll show me that I'm wrong to jump to that conclusion. Please show me how I can install the right driver on my laptop.    May 25, 2010  Please let me know when you'll be able to get back to me on my query above.    Thank you.      May 30, 2010  It's been more than a week now before my initial email to you.     Please let me know when you'll answer my May 21 query. If I don't hear from you in the next few days, I'll request a refund from Amazon and write up my experience with your company accordingly.    June 01, 2010  I have now tried to use your support chat line about a half dozen times during business hours. This is the message I get every time after I hit the submit button: \\\\\"Sorry! All operators in the department are currently offline.\\\\\" After taking the trouble to fill in the chat screen, getting this reply is incredibly annoying.      Beginning around May 25, I also started attempting to enter my original ticket via a \\\\\"chat.\\\\\"  I figured if the ticket approach wasn't working, perhaps the chat approach would.  But, as described in my June 1, 2010 ticket, every time I tried to start a chat--and I tried this at least a half dozentimes over the course of a week--I got this message: \\\\\"Sorry! All operators in the department are currently offline.\\\\\"    In the end, the pseudo technical support bothered me more than the incompatibility with Windows 7 Home Premium.  I called Amazon, explained the situation, and was immediately sent a postage-prepaid form so I could return the product to Amazon and get a full refund.  Thank god for Amazon's return policy!  And shame on Diamond for promising more than it was able to deliver.",

Becuase they are both 7 inches but the Galaxy has way more feature and full Android Play store. No need to go there for this review.<br /><br />Here's my observation and experience so far using it for a few days.<br /><br />Display -<br />Obviously, AMOLED kicks rear as typical with all Samsung devices.<br /><br />Screen -<br />Layout is a little lacking in terms of height/width adjustments.  I do not like the extra spacing between the clock and the weather, should've made it a little tigher together.  I felt the open spaces between widgets and icons just was useless and a waste of screen real estate..<br /><br />Sound  -<br />Much much louder than a Kindle for sure.  This is awesome on flights where you sit near the engine.<br /><br />Battery -<br />So far so good, I left it on with my WIFI on all day and came back after 9 hours of work to find it at 97%.  Not bad at all.  Have yet to play 2-3 movies to see if it'll hold up against what the Kindle can do on a 5hr flight. TBD<br /><br />WIFI -<br />does not see ad-hoc wifi (wifi tethering on phones), but nothing Foxfi BT or Rooting won't solve.  Not a killer deal but sucks compared to Kindle.<br /><br />Signal strength is fine for work or office and locks on quick.<br /><br />GPS -<br />Not not yet used, don't care to use it since I have a Galaxy 2 phone.<br /><br />Form factor -<br />Love it, great size, good feel to it, light enough to not feel fatigue when holding.  Though I have ordered a case and screen protector (which I always do).<br /><br />Memory size -<br />Yes like everyone says, around 3.5GB left on internal memory.  Nothing Rooting won't solve with APP to SD. :)  Love the External SD option.<br /><br />Charging cable , interface  -<br />This is where I hate.  Come'on Samsung don't you ever learn?  Galaxy 10 and now this? Who puts in a proprietary plug (I won't name Apple... Opps I did).  Also the cable is not long enough! Even the Kindle and Iconia had micro USB and both I've owned in the past.<br /><br />BLOAT WARE / Software?<br />My other grip is no SWYPE!

On the other hand, I assume that people who move their mouse in a wide range would not find it useful to have a static wrist-resting bump like this in the first place.<br />At the bottom, it is covered with a glossy (sticky feeling) material that helps the mousepad stay firm (not move around). In fact it is very stable: I have a glass desk and if I want to move the mousepad (e.g. a little to the right or left), it is practically impossible to drift on the glass. I have to lift it and land it where I want it to be. This also might not be the most comfortable thing, since for example if you change sitting position on your desk (tilt chair etc), you might have to do this frequently.<br />On the other if you like a mousepad that does not move around, this is it (I have also tried it on wooden surfaces).<br />I have uploaded pictures that try to give a better idea.

Though obvious, it'll be even more obvious depending on the position of your hands. If you're prostrate with your head on a pillow in bed, you'll definitely notice. The edges are somewhat rough, and it might do you some good to smooth them out. Once done, it'll be much more comfortable to type. I had a previous Speck cover with a 2011 Macbook Pro, and I can say that the edges were much more comfortable than this one. The clasps are on the front here, and thus bear the risk of scraping your wrists depending on where you place your hands. I tend to use this sitting up and with an external keyboard and mouse, and this I'm not nearly as affected by this.<br /><br />- I had to re-situate the display cover, and I am as of yet unsure of what difference was made between to the two efforts -- the second made the cover much more flush with the edges of the chassis,  though not perfectly (again, I don't need it to be perfect - I just need it to cover the chassis).<br /><br />- There are small nubs underneath the case that have fallen off quite easily.",

Some others have stated they had some problems with THIS model. I think they may have received one that was thrown around too hard, during shipping. (I've worked for FedEx Ground and trust me...stuff gets thrown around pretty hard, which is why you DON'T want your products to be just thrown into a box and shipped) Yes, mine DID arrive \\\\\"packed\\\\\" that way and I was extremely pissed off and almost sent them back. Styrofoam peanuts exist for a reason, which is why they are supposed to be used. A competitor that rhymes with NewRegg rarely pulls that crap. {yes I know both companies have affiliates that sell through them and therefore are not necessarily shipped by them} Bottom line is this drive DOES run pretty hot. (Put a small item under each end, to lift it up, and that will help it run a bit cooler) Regardless, transfers are fine and the extra heat doesn't seem to hurt it's ability to function as it should. I think the price I paid was almost definitely $80.00 with free shipping. Hope this helps in at least some way. As to that douche bag who commented on how my only other review wasn't golden enough for him: I can only say his parents told him FAR too often that he was the center of the universe and no one else matters as much as him. That guy needs to grow the hell up! I bet he's incredibly lonely, with his attitude that the world should always kiss his ass. I have to laugh, when wondering what HE has ever done for me.

I thought this hub would be a great deal, being one of the cheapest 3.0 hubs on Amazon and with such a high rating. Knowing already that this hub is bus powered, I went ahead with purchasing it anyway because of the 3 hard drives I was going to plug in, only one was a portable drive that needed usb power, and didn't expect any problems.<br /><br />The only problem I encountered was while using it was when transferring large amounts of data from a portable external drive to a desktop external drive. The transfer speed would start out normally for 3.0 hard drives but then would drop down to 10Mbps, appear to pause for a minute, and repeat for as long as the transfer went on. I thought it was possibly because the hub couldn't handle powering a portable drive while maintaining 3.0 speed between 2 drives on the same hub. Unplugging and transferring with one drive in the 3.0 port and the other on a 2.0 port turned out to be faster than on the hub.<br /><br />If you plan on using even ONE portable drive on this hub, I suggest saving your money and getting a 2.0 hub or buying a 3.0 hub with external power. If everything you plan to plug in to this hub has its own external power source or is a flash drive, go ahead, this hub is perfect for you. As for me, I'm probably going to buy myself an externally powered hub..",

Most of the books I read are just print with few pictures and maps etc. Second, the 3G is extremely light which I really like. The Fire is twice as heavy. The weight of the 3G makes it easy to read in bed or at the beach which I do often. I am completely satisfied.  It is easy to use,light and hand friendly.

But the idea of a $99 tablet that runs full windows 8.1 and includes 32G of storage that is upgradeable was just too tempting to my technology addiction.

Though it only has 1G of RAM, It runs windows quite well, largely due to the solid state storage. The screen is just 7&#34; but is clear and bright. And Windows 8.1, whatever you might have heard, is a great OS for a tablet. Second question: is it useful? It is for me. Using the included MS Office365, I can access my reports anywhere there is a wifi connection, including my smart phone. It works for editing, though I don't think I want to write the whole report on the little guy.<br /><br />Third question: Does it really get 8 hours from the battery? No it doesn't. But it gets 4-5 and you can use a standard car charger with the same standard Android phone mini usb. Last question: Am I glad I got it? Yes I am. It's a real Windows computer that weighs less than a pound. It works great to get online, it's a great reader, and Windows metro aps are much better developed than in the past. And it runs regular Windows programs.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with, and and convinced that this little tablet is the best made and fullest featured tablet you can find at the price.",

As a reader, the Kindle is perfect !  I used to think I would never get an electronic reader, that I loved the smell and feel of a real book too much.  Well I was wrong.  The convenience of having a library at my finger tips, all my books in one lightweight easy to carry place is a dream. In terms of business trips and vacations this is the best best best thing I could have purchased.  My Kindle is the last thing I see before I go to bed every night :)  I feel naked without her by my side, haha !<br /><br />But there are some negatives.  First of all, the power adapter port broke in about 4 months. I never found it easy to use, very wiggly, and honestly hard to fit the charger into.  Well it wiggled one too many times, became loose, and stopped working.  Now I called Amazon and had a NEW Kindle at my door the next day !  The customer service was awesome, one phone call, and my replacement was on it's way. But, it seems to me this is a design flaw.  I hope they make a more durable port with the next version that comes out.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is when I am browsing on the Web.  The browser can become very slow and unresponsive.  I find when that happens I need to power down and reboot the device.  Maybe it is resetting the memory or something?  I am not sure, but this is not for power web users.  I can browse at high speed when I am on a roll, investigating some topic that interests me.  It is frustrating to have to turn the device off once in a while.<br /><br />I like the size, small, but not too small, and oh so portable (I can throw it in my purse).  But I must admit the screen is just a tad too small for me.  I didn't want something as large as a tablet, that would be unwieldy and heavy and no good for reading.  But as a web browsing tool, it is not ideal.  If Amazon comes out with a slightly bigger screen, I would definitely replace this one.  A camera and 3G/4G service would be really nice as well.<br /><br />So bottom line, I love my Kindle and can't live without it, but if an new one comes out with a slightly bigger screen, 3G/4G, a camera, and a more powerful processor,  as long as the price is right, I will replace my current model.screen, I would definitely replace this one.

Then I could fold the card back and easily get the individual stickers loose. I did take care not to peel so far that I couldn't match the sticker to the appropriate letter--the stickers are clear except for the Hiragana character--and I got through the rest of the task in reasonably short order.  Note that these stickers are small and meant to fit on the crown of a standard key. I expect it should be fairly easy to line them up and then simply tap down with a fingertip.  I say I \\\\\"expect\\\\\" that because I actually applied it to an [[ASIN:B000V07N9U Apple Aluminum Keyboard]], which has key-tops much larger than a standard keyboard. The stickers did fit fairly easily, though I occasionally needed to adjust the placement after putting it down, and I frequently ended up with fingerprints on the adhesive.  Overall, though, now that they're in place, they do what I wanted them to do, which is simply to show me what key to hit when typing Hiragana.  It should be noted that these keys produce a layout for Kana typing, which is much less common than Romaji typing, which most operating systems default to when you set them to type in a Japanese character set. For the Mac, it's fairly simple to change to kana typing...as long as you know where to find the right preferences panel.",

I bought this keyboard (along with a long USB extension cable, a mouse and a 4-port USB hub) to keep near the bed. I'm very satisfied with this, especially compared to my previous solution (a wireless keyboard and mouse), which both had connection problems from that distance.<br /><br />You will notice right away that this keyboard feels heavier than you would expect it to be. It also appears to be built like a tank. I can accept the extra weight if it truly means that this keyboard is as sturdy and tough as it appears.<br /><br />Pressing the Num Lock key causes several of the letters on the keyboard to be replaced by the number pad. While it can be slightly annoying to accidentally start typing numbers because the Num Lock key is activated, I like that more than having to hold the Fn key every time I want to use the number pad, like on most laptops. Overall, this feature is welcomed.<br /><br />I don't like the lack of a volume control, but this is fixed with software like AutoHotkey or TyperTask (both of which I already had installed on my computer). Since the point of this device is to be as small as possible while still being a functional keyboard, I can accept this omission.<br /><br />I very quickly got used to the position of the left Ctrl key. It won't be an issue unless you have trouble adapting to things in general. Perhaps I adjusted so quickly because the laptops I set up for people at work have the left Ctrl key in the same place (with the Fn key to its left). I don't use them, but I guess seeing it often enough prepared me for it! Because of the Num Lock feature, I have never actually touched the Fn key, so maybe they could have omitted it and saved themselves from the many people who complain about its position!<br /><br />Overall, this keyboard is very versatile, and highly recommended.",

I get about 3-6 hrs on it, depending on what I am doing; The old battery would have been 7-9hrs (Lenovo brand). This battery is alot cheaper, and thus you get lower quality battery components to make the battery life lower. Lenovo's power manager identifies the battery as:<br /><br />Full charge capacity: 43.09Wh<br />Current: 1.10A<br />Voltage: 11.77V<br />Wattage: 12.56W<br />Temp: 20C. (just booted up).<br />Cycle count : 4<br />Manufacture name: SONY<br />Manufacture date: 2013-08-29<br />First used: 2013 - 08<br />Device chemistry: Li-Ion<br />Design capacity: 47.52 Wh (sticker on battery and specs on amazon show 49Wh; so it is a bit low)<br />Design voltage: 10.80V.<br />Also, the serial number that Lenovo sees is the the same as the one that is stuck onto the battery.<br /><br />As you can see, the design capacity has already dropped 4 Wh with just 4 cycle counts (thus 3 star not 4). I'll see how this continues and if the full charge capacity keeps dropping, if it seems to level off where it is then I'll bring it back up to 4 stars.<br /><br />I purchased this battery on Nov 11, 2013; so it was manufactured just months before, which is good. Sometimes I see things that are years old being send out via amazon...<br /><br />As per the directions send from Ankey, I plugged the battery in, dropped it to 7%, charged to full overnight, dropped to 7%, and repeated for 3 cycles to fully exercise the battery. Hopefully this will help keep the full charge capacity where it should be.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good investment since the battery cost $36, compared to the Lenovo's $188 price, however, at the time of writing this review, the Lenovo battery is on sale down to $70... for that price, I might have grabbed the Lenovo brand instead to ensure that I got the higher hours.<br /><br />If you are planning to use this for flights, then you might need to carry a spare, since the 3-6hrs is not a lot of time. From what little I've seen so far, recharge time is about 4 hours, when the laptop is running. I am not sure when it is not running.<br /><br />The quality of the battery itself is good. It is completely sealed; and the blue backing, (which I thought might just be an insert) is actually glued down onto the battery.<br /><br />Shipping\\packaging wise, the battery comes in the box shown which is made out of very sturdy cardboard and the battery itself is surrounded by foam to prevent damage.<br /><br />I would buy again if I needed to, of course based on how long it lasts with this 1Wh per cycle count trend I am hoping to see stop.",

I set it up as RAID 5, and the MBP immediately recognized it as a 9TB drive and asked if I wanted to initialize it. I formatted it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and it is showing up and behaving like any other external hdd.<br /><br />I have tested data transfer to it with both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, and both work as expected. It is able to take advantage of the USB 3.0 speed quite nicely and I am currently transferring 150GB in about 20 mins. I mention this specifically because there have been issues in the past with other Mediasonic 4-bay enclosures being able to work properly with Mac's implementation of USB 3.0. This seems to work without any issues.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to test the sleep feature on it, but will update when I have the chance.<br /><br />The Mediasonic works as expected in regards to plugging and unplugging; I can eject the disk in finder, unplug it, and it will quickly turn itself off. I can then plug it back in and it will turn itself back on and initialize back in finder. I mention this because I have other external hard drive enclosures that have a very strange and specific order that they need to be switched on, plugged in, ejected, unplugged, turned off, ect. and will cause problems if the 'recipe' isnt followed. This Mediasonic works nicely like any normal self-contained external hard drive.<br /><br />I won't go into the form factor/lights/sounds/etc, as other reviews have already done well in that regard, I just wanted to give a review specifically for other mac users.

This is because all of the keys are recessed bellow the top surface of the keyboard. A hidden cost of it being thin.<br /><br />2. Build quality. The corners of the case where the silver shell and the white plastic met were not well aligned such that there was a distinct gap between the two.<br /><br />3. Ergonomics. Getting the iPad into and out of the case was not smooth or graceful, frankly it was clumsy. Again, a hidden cost of it being so minimalistic<br /><br />Did it function, sure. Could I type on it, sure. Did I make mistakes, constantly. The key layout (especially the bottom right + carriage return) was very annoying to me, I kept going for the shift key and hitting the up arrow, this may be a problem with me rather than the keyboard, but I could live without the arrow keys in return for a slightly more traditional arrangement down there.<br /><br />What I really wanted was the Apple wireless bluetooth keyboard attached to my iPad, that is not what I got.

The thing rubber coating is to prevent heat from the HDD creating a hot casing that may burn you.  This thing stays cool after I left it in for over 2 full days of consistent use.<br /><br />The casing is two aluminum plates with a plastic center to help disperse heat. The casing comes with 8 Screws:  4 tiny ones that secure the aluminum plates to the plastic center case, and 4 medium ones that secure the hard drive to the case.  If you do not use all four screws, the HDD will move, and cause major problems, and most likely fail quickly.<br /><br />The USB 3.0 Cable does NOT require you to use both USB ports unless you have an older computer using USB 1.1 ports AND an older style HDD.  I used a 1.5TB ,2.5 inch drive in a USB 3.0 port and only needed one cable.  I used the 2.0 ports, and still only needed 1 port.  However, when I used the 1.1 port, I needed both to get the drive to read.<br /><br />This case, although the product description is inconsistent, will accept SATA I,II, III.  All of them will work and they will all work with MAC as well as PC.  It accepted my 2TB pocket drive SATA III with no problem and took about 2 hours to transfer 400GB of memory...  Great!!!<br /><br />I have one similar to this, That I purchased from amazon, and its a Masscool brand. Model# (UHB-2221)<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Masscool-2-5-Hard-Drive-Enclosure/dp/B005YJO6IO/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1365802300&sr=8-13&keywords=masscool<br /><br />They are almost identical, other than the USB 3.0 and the Lack of the OTB button on this model. However, They both work great, and I recommend this product.<br /><br />I would suggest using a different screwdriver, because I believe they have built in a torque prevention safety, that allows the metal rod of the screw driver to turn, thus not allowing the screws to be over-tightened, but if you have tounscrew them, they screwdriver will probably trip and torque setting and not do what you want.<br /><br />Although the screws are small, they strip just as any other screw. If you are not careful placing them, which can be a pain, you can strip them, no different than any other Enclosure.<br /><br />EXTRA PERKS:<br /><br />The casing comes with a strip of adhesive plastic that lays over top of the screws to hide them, and this works great and is a nice feature if you only plan on placing an HDD in the enclosure one time.<br /><br />The (leather) case is nice, and fits snug over the Enclosure to prevent scratching and whatnot.<br /><br />There is also, NO DRIVERS NEEDED. !!!!<br />Overall, this works great and allows for convenient use.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005YJO6IO Masscool 2.5\\\\\" Hard Drive Enclosure]]",

I initially thought the 2560x1080 format was what I was looking for and purchased the 29\\\\\" AOC Q2963PM. I found the display beautiful, but it was generally awkward for anything beyond gaming.<br /><br />I decided to give the Shimian a try, wanting to minimize HUD/UI elements in-game, and also wanting to step up to an IPS panel. This is a well-reviewed monitor on many tech websites, but all of versions I saw had a white bezel and back panel. I wasn't sure what to expect, but decided the price was worth the risk.<br /><br />Shipping was free via FedEx from Korea and arrived within 3 days. My only disappointment is that it ships in the retail box, but it did arrive unharmed. A couple of notes about items included in the box: a power brick and cord for a 240v wall socket are provided. The brick has a label that states it's able to handle 120-240v so I was able to plug in my previous monitor's cord into the brick and was good-to-go. An instruction manual is included, printed entirely in Korean which will do you no good, although you'll probably be fine without it.<br /><br />The monitor I received is exactly as pictured above. I'd describe the thin back as almost cast iron feeling (yes, it feels that sturdy) with a stunning piece of black glass attached to the front. It's crazy-thin and when wall-mounted using a VESA mount, only extends from the wall by about an inch and 1/2. Aesthetically, it's the most beautiful monitor I've ever seen.<br /><br />Powering the monitor on, I had no dead pixels (whew), but noticed quite a bit of light bleed on the top left and bottom left corners. This bothers me much less than dead or stuck pixels because I'm rarely staring at a pure black screen. On-screen menus, like the manual, are all in Korean, although a few of the settings are self-explanatory based on the images. I was able to change the color profile to sRGB without too much trouble. If there is an option to change the monitor language to English I didn't see it. (EDIT: Found it!)<br /><br />My impression of overall image quality and gaming at 1440p is that everything looks incredible. I noticed about a 10-15 fps drop do to the extra pixels needing to be pushed by my graphics card, but the quality improvement made this loss acceptable. I haven't noticed ghosting, although I rarely play FPS games where this might be more of an issue. I'd describe the look of motion to be a bit more cinematic looking--but maybe this is the definition of ghosting. Either way, I actually like the look.<br /><br />Wrapping things up, I highly recommend this monitor. I've heard that this is the same panel as Apple's Cinema Display (although one of their rejects since they only accept the A+ panels). Because of this, your mileage may vary. If you're lucky, you'll end up with an affordable and beautiful panel like I did. It's probably my most treasured piece of electronics right now if that gives you any indication of how impressed I am.",

Mine was loose after 3 times of screwing it onto the tripod. If you have purchased this mount you should immediately inspect it. The nut can easily get separated from its housing and cause the Ipad to drop and possibly sustain damage. IMHO this defect makes this mount unstable, hence unreliable. Add to that no response from the seller and I say \\\\\"BUYER BEWARE\\\\\".<br /><br />I'm hoping iShot addresses this manufacture defect soon, as I suggested this mount to several of my musician friends. I would hate to think it's my fault their Ipad gets damaged. imagine when he starts selling a lot of mounts.

But if the seller never responds, which is the case, how does one obtain a warranty repair or replacement?<br /><br />Edit July 26, 2013<br />Finally heard back from iShot. They said they were having email problems. I explained the problem with the floppy nut. They deny anyone else having this problem with their unit. Now they want me to ship it back, instead of sending me the minor part to fix it myself. I already paid a lot for the mount, considering its construction. Now I have to pay shipping to send it back, so they can fix a 50 cent part.<br /><br />I will amend the review favorably, if the seller honors his warranty and either sends the parts or repairs or replaces my unit at no cost to me.",

It has never given me any problems while trying to disconnect it (some hard drives I've used in the past have the problem of giving an error message when trying to close them via the windows \\\\\"safely remove hardware\\\\\" assistant). Also, the  blue indicator light is not only stylish, but very useful for seeing if the disk is working or stopped. Another great thing is that the drive is noiseless! Even when working at full speed (while transfering files or importing CD's...or when left downloading large files all night) the drive is silent. Considering the competition, I have two criticisms for this drive: its terrible software and the lack of a quick synchronization button. The backup software is hard to use, confusing, and not powerful at all. It takes ages to encrypt your files and then it is impossible to navigate through them (for example, it doesn't show thumbnails for photo files, so you have to open them one by one to find them!). Maxtor\u00b4s One-Touch drives are much better at backup because the software is much more comprehensible and the button allows for instant synch.

I liked the touch screen option especially with Windows 8, Unfortunately when I went to buy it they were sold out so I figured Amazon is always my go to when I cant find something. I paid a little more and purchased the 3 year warranty. It arrived 2 days later (Thanks Prime) I unboxed it and first thing I wanted to try was the touchscreen, but even know best buy's exact same model had a touch screen and TQcybermall had answered someone's question to whether this was a touchscreen unit with a \\\\\"Yes this is a touchscreen.\\\\\" This is not a touch screen computer. First problem of many.<br /><br />The keyboard..... Backlight keyboard cool, but the fact that it is completely open to suck in any dust or garbage that might fall in there is horrible. Not to mention the keys have this annoying click that only seems to be getting worse. Normally I would think hey I got a bad one (seems to be the way most of my purchases go) but that doesn't seem to be the case, rather just a flaw in the design.<br /><br />The Fkeys..... Why in the world would you make the fkeys control laptop functions without pressing the function key? Maybe I'm missing something but I cant alt-f4 anything because of the display switch option or bind any of my fkeys to anything in-game without a popup adjusting volume or trying to change a track.<br /><br />The Touchpad..... While its extremely big and can sense multiple touch, which is nice for Windows 8 and the whole App feel. The left and right click are not separate from the touchpad and horribly close to the edge. Making me think well maybe I'll just buy a wireless mouse, but who wants more stuff to carry around with your laptop.<br /><br />The Speakers..... They sound great at higher volumes, but as soon as sound gets low it seems to be distorted or misplaced. Very annoying while playing games where sound can be the difference between a win and loss.<br /><br />Its not all bad though, Ido like the fact that I can play my games on a laptop without having to scale back on graphics and the display is nice and crisp.<br /><br />I'm just not happy that I spent so much to feel so cheated. In the end Id rather carry around a mouse / keyboard / headset then deal with this laptop. I guess it's my fault for not looking a little deeper at this laptop, but now that its open its mine and there is nothing I can do about it. Hopefully no one else makes the same mistake.",

            "input": "Purchased:  July 2011  My expectations for a netbook were sufficiently low.  I have been following the developments since MIT's Nicholas Negroponte first founded the One Laptop Per Child organization (OLPC), a few years ago.  After donating a few netbooks through OLPC, I decided to get an adult netbook of my own.    I wanted something light weight with a good size keyboard and efficient power management that would allow me to securely track my finances during extended trips.  I preferred a netbook with the LINUX operating system.  My companion insisted the netbook should be able to stream Netflix videos and the Rhapsody music service.  Netflix requires the Silverlight software which only runs on the Windows operating system.  I was leaning toward ASUS hardware due to their reputation for high quality.  After a reasonable search, I settled on this ASUS/Windows machine.  The netbook has a role, but it is still not intended to replacement a full size laptop.  I am amazed at how close it comes to replacing a laptop.       WHEN READING MY HIGHLY CRITICAL REVIEW, KEEP IN MIND, AFTER ALL THE SOFTWARE AND FIRMWARE UPDATES ARE IN PLACE YOU WILL BE REASONABLY PLEASED WITH THIS NETBOOK.  Enough of my gibberish, let us get on with the review.  I purchased the ASUS eee PC 1015-PX netbook, 2 GB of RAM, ASUS mouse, ASUS external DVD reader/writer, PC-to-TV video converter, and audio cables.    THE GOOD:  - The eee PC hardware:  keyboard, screen, and basic build are excellent for a netbook.  - Windows 7 Starter Edition is more than competent operating system for a Netbook.  Once everything is updated it is a smooth running system with the familiar look and feel of your desktop.  - Windows 7 Starter Edition can stream Netflix movies, Rhapsody music, Photo Shop pictures, and run most software in the Windows ecosystem.  Videos and web content can be displayed from the netbook to a TV with a proper PC-to-TV converter.  - Windows 7 Starter Edition is not a streamline and low maintenanceoperating system, but it is a familiar interface with a plethora of software choices.  It is more than adequate for most netbook uses.  THE BAD:  - Windows 7 Starter Edition is basically a crippled version of Windows 7.  It does not support reading/writing DVD's.  Normally, I would not have a problem with this, except ASUS failed to supply a copy of the Windows installation software on external media, because Windows 7 Starter Edition can not read DVD's.  Putting the Windows recovery files on CD-Rom is unthinkable - it would take approximately 30 CD's to store the 17GB of files.  - Normally the major updates like Windows service packs are preinstalled on the PC's.  The burden of installing the Windows 7 Service Pack#1 and prior updates is passed on to the customer.  You will invest a lot of quality time getting Windows 7 up to date.   - The only audio speaker is of poor quality compared to the rest of the hardware.  Why ASUS decided to install one cheap speaker on otherwise very nice hardware is beyond me.  The audio is very nice when using external stereo spearkers.  Yes, this is the newer model and it still only has one speaker.  Beware, the one audio port serves as both an audio-out and an audio-in port.  A software switch determines whether it is in input or output mode.  - The documentation attempts to cover several different netbook models on the same pages.  It is frequently difficult to determine which model was being described.  The user guide on the PC is slightly more informative than the paper booklet.  ASUS online user forum is not helpful.  Reading some of the responses to the customers pleas for help caused me to flinch.  The forum moderators are very arrogant and belittled those lacking technical skills.    THE UGLY (It may get a little technical):  - There are no Windows 7 Starter Edition operating system DVD's included with this computer.  If the recovery files on the hard drive are destroyed, you are out of luck.  You must decide whether to purchase a +16GB thumb drive to backup the Starter Edition and recovery files or use that money to upgrade to the Home Edition and use your standard backup software - assuming you backup your current system.  Keep in mind once the recovery software (ISO) is loaded on the thumb drive you can not use the self-booting drive to store any other files.  - The installed BIOS version 1101 is horrible and caused a number of issues.  The  netbook had problems recognizing my external ASUS CD/DVD reader with the installed BIOS.  The BIOS exhibited irratic behavior when attempting to access the BIOS setup panel.  Following the instructions in the manual, the included system software directs you to the ASUS BIOS repositories on the internet, but ASUS no longer updates the firmware on the sites.  In fact, the firmware in the BIOS repositories is older than the installed BIOS.  Eventually, I found the latest BIOS (version 1301) on the ASUS support site.  Be careful, blotching a BIOS flash can leave you with a non-working computer.  Save the current BIOS first, and then do not interrupt while the BIOS is being updated.    - The hard drive can not be replaced.  There is no access panel for it.  The case has to be completely disassembled voiding the warranty in the process.  You can only hope it never fails.  CONCLUSION:  The ASUS eee PC 1015-PX is a decent piece of hardware except for the speaker and touchpad button.  It has excellent battery life.  Once all the operating system and BIOS updates are in place it is an acceptable computer for travel.  Getting this computer setup properly is no fun, but your reward is a well built and smooth running machine.    SUGGESTIONS:  - The latest BIOS and drivers are on the ASUS support site.  I would go there first.  - Plan on spending a lot of quality time updating Windows 7.  The Service Pack #1 update will not run automatically.  You will have to start it manually.  - While upgrading the memory, I had a bit of a problem finding the cover screw for the memory compartment.  It is covered by a plastic plug that is a perfect match to the case.  It looks to be part of the case, but it is not.  Just pry it off with a fine head screw driver.  Search YouTube for a video \\\\\"ASUS eee PC Memory Upgrade\\\\\" for installation help.  You are not authorized to perform any updates to the ASUS hardware - memory included.  Do not look to ASUS customer support for any help.  - I was able to use the built-in backup/recovery software to store the Windows 7 Starter Edition recovery files to an old 40GB hard drive sitting in an external USB HD enclosure.  Now keep in mind that entire hard drive can nolonger be used for anything other than holding the +16GB of recovery files.  The computer geeks would be better served using 3rd party software to make an image copy of the entire hard drive.  It would certainly be more space efficient.  That is my next step.  In case you were wondering, the included backup software will not write the recovery files to CD-Rom.  - I am not sure how well this netbook would work with LINUX.  Some of the key features, the audio port toggle switch and the power saving mode, are both controlled by Windows specific software.  These device specific software  components (drivers) may not exist in the LINUX world.  You may lose a lot of functionality.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  UPDATE:  November 5, 2011  I tried the eee PC with UBUNTU Linux and touchpad issues disappeared.

Given the number of positive reviews, perhaps this is not standard, but my snap, though it was secure in keeping the Nook from falling off the case, was not tight internally, meaning the Nook lazily freewheeled in a circle while you were looking at it.

I tried everything I could think of to fix it and no luck.  Thoughts of seeing bad reviews from others here where their drive didn't work ran through my head.<br /><br />After reading and trying the FAQ on Iomega's website, I wanted to call them for help.  Apparently to call for help costs $25 per incident.  I was going to write in their forums but I noticed when others asked for help, replies were usually a day or 2 or 3 out from the question, not wanting to wait 1 to 3 days for a possible answer, I used the online chat they have. I hate the online tech support chats so I wasn't expecting much.  However after explaining my situation to the guy, he was really helpful.  Nothing we tried worked so he suggested reformatting the new drive and renaming it.  I saw in the menus on my computer where the drive was there, but offline due to a collision conflict with another drive. But I was able to rename my new drive (I did not reformat it) and BOOM I was now able to click it online and it worked.<br /><br />So for anyone out there who finds a need to purchase a second drive, and if you go with the exact same model, you will most likely get this same problem.

Yes, when I eyeballed the interior inset space, I was like, \\\\\"Hmmm, I wonder...\\\\\" Superb!<br /><br />Why am I so excited? Well, ever since I started doing daily Android App video reviews, I have been on a constant search for a display that would hold my tablet at not only a decent viewing angle, but vastly more importantly, hold it rock steady so I don't get wibble-wobble as I touch, poke, perhaps energetically play a game as I demonstrate it. This is it, folks. This is it for both portrait and landscape orientations. I have finally found my solution.<br /><br />Plus, I can use the little cutouts at the top for general tool purposes, and the included capacitive stylus. I must highlight this stylus... it has a generously wide 7.5mm tip with a chunky wood grip. The tip is a standard rubber (not capacitive mesh), but I have seen the few pens available in this style and tip width go easily for 10 bucks alone.<br /><br />Now as I mention in my video review, I feel necessary to disclose that the unit I received does have minor cosmetic flaws. Certain imperfections are to be expected in a wood product, but there are also a couple drip lines from the finish lacquer around the interior edges. Nothing particularly discernible to the casual eye (heck, I left plenty of similar drip lines with my own lacquer work), yet as one who has been among guitar players who find even the slightest speck on a new axe maddening, I feel compelled to mention it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am supremely happy with this stand, and for those of you who may be following my Amazon's Free App of the Day video reviews... you shall be seeing this nifty stand in constant action. :D<br /><br />-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.",

The product met or exceeded every technology requirement without exception.   This product received our highest value, ease of use, design, networking, and durability ratings.   Instead of buying books and placing them on shelves, we are purchasing this portable hand held digital library for students to check-out and use.  (We lack the funding to simply give each student their own unit).    Objections to the device: Old style 20th century vintage English Language Arts (ELA) teachers could not overcome the lack of physically turning pages when reading.  Apparently old style paradigms die hard for the veteran teachers.  Students embraced this digital library with energy and full enthusiasm.  (When inflexible Teachers fail to recognize the abilities of students, you can stop wondering why we have education problems in this country).

Dont get me wrong it has some nice features & quality to it but the problems surpasses the nice things that it gives it would have you pulling out your hair.

It seems to happen if the tab has to load too much info from websites or takes too long to load. NOTE...I HAVE THE MAX INTERNET SPEED MONEY CAN BUY ALSO..Checked with Amazon to have something done, i just missed my return window but I can sell my $299 mint condition tab back to them for $140, not happening. Called up Samsung to have somthing done, only to be told even thou under warranty,  I wolud have pay to ship & returned back to me. Even if I do all this, they cant guarantee that they will fix or replace it if they deem it work properly, i would hope this is not a properly working device because I would have to say this Samsung product & customer service SINKS & Amazon isnt any better for selling it on there website.

I'm assuming this powerful &#34;quad core&#34; was supposed to make it so that the computer is more powerful, but it seems that it's just slowing it down! I had read about people having trouble with the Windows 8 configuration but I set my computer so that it automatically bypasses that weird &#34;touchscreen&#34; screen from the beginning (someone told me that it would help decrease the lag), and it's still slow! I don't even do much on it ... Seriously, just web browsing and/or using iTunes or Amazon Music Player. The &#34;craziest&#34; thing I've tried to do on this computer is watch Netflix and that failed.

I feel more \\\\\"safe\\\\\" from spills with the other cover on, yet I prefer this one, as it has a nice, simple look that complements the computer well. The other cover is larger, and extends over the well of the keyboard and sits directly next to the speakers. The backlight is a bit muted, but still shines nicely through the cover.<br /><br />Also, it may just be me, but I find typing very quickly to be a bit difficult with the cover on. I wish it was a bit thinner, and had some \\\\\"stickiness\\\\\" just along its circumference to firmly secure it into place. It's hard to describe, but by  \\\\\"stickiness\\\\\" I'm referring to a rubbery, shiny material I found on the underside of the different cover.<br /><br />Overall it's a great cover, one that feels sturdier than the moshi cleargaurd.

I buy the full body shield, don't apply the back and cut it to use to protect the screen of another ipad (does not fit exactly but gets the job done).

I put tape on the screen and have used it without issue for another year until the Zagg, in one week, refused to charge and then the case just fell apart because microscopic screws had fallen out of the hinge and then bent the connections.  Fine.  I ordered another Zagg this week.  This time, a Zagg Keys Cover, because it closed like the Folio.  I just received that today and within half an hour of putting my ipad into the slot, there were glass slivers all over.  Yes, it's going back, but now it's impossible to use the ipad and be able to see through the cracks, which are slowly taking over the whole screen.  Will Apple fix this?

After sparring with Amazon over this fiasco, I finally got them to ship me this card, the 660 Signature2 3072 LE and ship it in one business day. Now, the card I originally ordered is being shown as shipping in two to four weeks again, instead of the two to three months.  Somehow, Amazon cannot seem to get that card in stock and ship it in a timely manner.

Using my 15-inch MacBook Pro at meetings works for me, but it takes up too much space on our table and seems generally in the way. So, I prefer using my iPad for note taking. The Livescribe Smartpen is the perfect answer. I was disappointed to discover that it doesn't work with my iPad 2, but it does work with my iPad Mini with Retina display and with my iPhone 5, and since I take those notes on a separate pad of special paper (included), tablet or phone size doesn't matter.<br /><br />The pen includes access to an app that requires a $45-per-year subscription. The first year is included, but the pro version is not required, though some may wish to have its additional features. However, it seems to me that Livescribe could have developed its own proprietary app that does not cost an additional annual fee. I haven't tried the pen with other note-taking apps, though I suspect it will work just fine. The accuracy of this smartpen is amazing. The only times I've had a problem is when my own handwriting gets sloppy--and for many of us this may happen frequently, since we rarely write anymore. I'm happy to get this practice with my handwriting, which used to be quite good.<br /><br />Those who occasionally wish to take notes directly on the screen of any tablet or smart phone (without a separate paper pad) might be interested in the Adonit Jot Script Fine-Point Stylus. It will work with a variety of note-taking apps.<br /><br />The bottom line: PRO: This tool is very useful to those of us who, like me, need to take notes that remain as a digital record for later reference across devices or to send to colleagues. I end up with both a digital and a hardcopy version of my notes. CON: As cool and useful as it is, the Livescribe 3 seems quite expensive to me. I realize this may be a &#34;scale of economy&#34; issue, but one needs to assess whether there exists a real need for this tool.my&#34; issue, but one needs to assess whether there exists a real need for this tool.",

However, technical documentation formatted for something like A4 becomes too small on 6inch making reading painful for eyes.  This was primary reason for considering Kindle DX. Second was availability of several computer magazines in digital format:  \\\\\"System Administrator\\\\\" and \\\\\"Linux Format Russian Edition\\\\\" for example.    So we got our Kindle DX Global Wireless about one month ago.  In general I am satisfied with this device:  - large screen makes technical documentation and books much easier to read  - computer magazines mentioned above are quite readable (yes, text is quite small sometimes, but landscape mode helps and we got used to small text reading on Sony PRS 505)    On the other hand, I could not say that device is perfect:  - PDF support is quite primitive, no TOC and no links. Dictionary does not work in PDF (except if word is typed directly)  - At least one of digital magazine issue (Linux Format Russian Edition, issue 128) locks up or reboot device on page 32. But it may be some formatting specifics since this page is rendered very slowly even on PC.  - No SD/MS memory card slot. I need to attach Kindle DX to PC to load new documents on it and clean up space at the same time plus archive them somewhere else.  - No russian fonts support. While DX is not our primary device for reading fiction and magazines seems to have embedded fonts, sometimes I would like to read fiction books in Russian in mobi format. So I had to install Unicode font hack for Russian texts properly displayed.  - Device with cover attached is quite bulky and heavy to hold it comfortably and it needs to be treated carefully due to large glass screen. But it is understandable and acceptable.    So I could conclude that device is worth its money andI am quite pleased with it.    Cheers!  Timofey Kutergin, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia",

While these speakers are not going to deliver theater quality sound when you play games or watch movies, for average use they are quite nice.<br /><br />with that said, the monitor is not without flaws. the speaker volume can be controlled with the up and down buttons, however, not sure if it is common problem, or I received a bad unit, only the down button works directly but not the up button.  what I meant is if I press the volume down button, a built-in menu would show up on the screen indicating the current volume level, and I can then adjust the volume with either the up or the down button; however, if I started out by pressing the up button, nothing would happen. So in order to increase the volume, I have to press down first, and then up.<br /><br />Another inconvenience is in order to mute the speakers on the volume, it takes a few button presses because it can only be done using the built-in menu.  So if I am enjoying music and then the phone rings, I would always fumble in order to turn off the music, and between the 1/2 and up/down buttons, it is hard to remember which button is exit, which is select, and which is to pick another menu entry.<br /><br />Another inconvience is that the monitor doesn't come with a headset jack.

A simply restraining strap would have solved that problem.    *It's difficult to put it into landscape mode, and once it's in there, the bottom tends to round so it rocks back and forth slightly -- irritating when you're trying to watch a movie!      *I did like the pouch at the top; finally, someplace to put the stylus!  Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make up for the disappoitnments.    *Finally, in order to fit the keyboard, the case is about 1 - 1 1/2 inches longer than the iPad, which made it not fit in my netbook case... I should have seen that one coming, though.    Overall, I had really high hopes for this one, but it didn't live up to it.  My search continues!

My Kindle was sent to me with a defect in the screen, it has two small bubble-like darker spots on the top of the screen (about a combined circumference of 1cm).  I am not sure if the it is a manufacture defect, or if the kindle got damaged in shipping, either way I am not impressed. These spots don't overly affect the kindle's function, but it annoying to have bought a brand-new product and have it come with a defect.  I am currently debating whether I should return it and go with a different e-reader that I am actually able to buy in a store and see that there are no defects before purchasing.    In terms of the kindle's function, I don't feel that I can give a accurate assessment as I am slightly jaded in my opinion of the kindle now. Page turns are slow, but i hear they use to be worse.  I do recommend the MEDGE bright light, it does a good job (I actually haven't used it on my kindle, but it has been working well for my paper novel that I returned to using), I like that the light has 3 different brightness settings.    In the Wi-Fi-3G debate, I chose just the Wi-Fi.  I was quite torn about which model to order, but I am quite glad that I chose the Wi-Fi.  Thinking about it, I am always around Wi-Fi at home and work.  If I am going to travel, I will just load a couple of books before I leave, to last me the trip. I don't think the 3G is necessary unless you have no or limited access to Wi-Fi. So for my purposes for the kindle, the 3G just isn't worth it.   Hope this helps!",

I will still find a use for it because I have several chargers that disconnect from the base.

If the pad were off-center and to the left, and it were smaller, that would not be an issue.<br />- OK, maybe another, but much less important to me than the above issue.  Bang & Olufsen should be ashamed of themselves.  The sound on this machine?  Meeh!<br /><br />Pros -<br />- Takes only about 4 seconds at most to boot-up, and that's after I loaded up all of my programs.<br />- Handles apps/programs extremely well and fast, including my Dragon Medical voice recognition software.  The latter was especially important for me, as no laptop I've used has been able to run the full version of Dragon Medical without issue.  This laptop, though, runs the software flawlessly and quickly (the algorithms process immediately and through the sentences onto the screen without any delay.  Faster, in fact, than my HP desktop hex-core with 16mb RAM).<br />- Came with 8.1 Pro already installed, even though the order said it would come with 8.0 Pro alongside a free upgrade.  On that issue, then, Asus under-promised and over-delivered.<br />- The display is pretty incredible.<br /><br />Additional info -<br />RAID 0:  For whatever reason (I've heard that it has to do more with how Windows 8.1 handles RAID 0, on this computer anyway), my two 256 SD drives (512 total) came configured with RAID 0 using the following partitions:<br />- Drive C:  labeled \\\\\"OS\\\\\" is 190 gb;<br />- Drive D:  labeled \\\\\"Data\\\\\" is 265 gb.<br />- Three additional (hidden) partitions for Health & Recovery total 21 gb.<br />So, this is not a traditional RAID 0 striping method: at least not they way I'm used to seeing in other computers I've had configured with RAID 0.  No issue for me, as a traditional RAID 0 would have given me a single active drive of 256 gb of effective space, while instead I have two active partitions totaling 455 gb of effective space.<br /><br />Tech Support:  I found tech support to be excellent.  I realize that other reviewers had a different experience than me.<br />- First, locating the number to tech support was easy.<br />- Second, they answered the phone late at night.<br />- Third, the person who answered the phone was surprisingly knowledgeable, without having to transfer me to someone else.<br />- Fourth, after my questions were answered, upon learning that this was my first Windows 8 experience (coming from Windows 7 Ultimate), the tech support individual volunteered to show me some quick tips and tricks to minimize frustration and improve my learning curve.<br /><br />Keyboard - I type about 150 WPM.  No issue on this machine.  Nothing weird about the keys or the configuration.  One previous reviewer said something about the \\\\\"Delete key\\\\\" being odd.  Not so on the computer that I was sent.  The delete key is just like any other key on that top row.  All good, all normal.<br /><br />Wireless - Connects instantly - even when coming out of sleep mode.<br /><br />Gaming - Not my area of expertise, as I'm not a serious computer gamer.  I have an Addams Family Pinball machine at home that I've never tired of.<br /><br />Aesthetics:  Let's face it, the subtle-sapphire casing is drop dead gorgeous.<br /><br />Weight - This machine is svelte and light.

I wasn't looking for a neoprene sleeve but rather an actual clam shell type. I found many similar products by other brands but they where either more expensive or reviews mentioned that it did not fit my particular drive. So I went ahead with this DRIVE LOGIC brand based on reviews and price, and let me say I am very happy with it. Overall the case feels solid enough to protect my drive from accidental bumps or waist height falls. The external pouch is a made of neoprene which holds any extra cable you might need with your drive. The zipper is of a high quality type. Inside there is an elastic strap which holds the drive securely over the soft memory foam. And, on the opposite side there is a mesh pouch for a small cable (I do not recommend using this pouch for very large cables since the connector might scratch the drive). My only complain is that there is no memory foam on the lid side or a separator so if you where to press the case hard enough, the cable or the same lid will come into contact with the drive. But I am quite happy with my purchase, I highly recommend this case if you have a Seagate Backup Plus portable drive or any other of similar dimensions.<br /><br />Pics uploaded.",

I love HP products and found this mouse, taking a chance after reading that most reviews were happy. I'm happy too.It works perfectly! So far, I have not needed to change the battery. I never shut it off and I use it everyday at work and at home. The only minor glitch is that it takes 1-2 seconds to wake up, so you're clicking randomly to do that if you've been away from your computer. Another is, you have to wait for your OS (W7 in my case) to find the mouse when loading. A radio operates the second the pointer appears on-screen, prior to logging in.  Those are very minor issues and probably would occur with any bluetooth mouse. I LOVE this mouse. I gave 4 stars to sensitivity and battery life for just those reasons. One last point, if you loose the connection with this mouse, sometimes, the sync button and/or turn it on/off does not work. I typically hibernate my computer, but have to restart to get it going - rarely does this happen. I still recommend this mouse!!!    Good luck",

But the Quiet Pro is perfect for a quiet office... just slightly noisier than a membrane keyboard and MUCH quieter than the Quickfire.  So a small reduction in feel for a major reduction in noise seems to be a very workable compromise.<br /><br />When you hold it, the Quiet Pro has a similar solid feel to that of the Quickfire, which projects a quality image.  Yes, the Quiet Pro isn't cheap, but it's one of a few keyboards that combines quiet operation with the great typing feel of mechanical switches.<br /><br />BTW, I listened to several Youtube videos that demonstrated the level of noise of several different keyboards.

I have a fairly expensive stereo system in my room, so naturally the sound quality that this headset offers pales in comparison, but I wasn't looking for that. The sound quality is adequate, the recording quality is acceptable. The headset will pick up a lot of background noise when it records, but that can be easily remedied by a quick filter on audio software.<br /><br />I think I bought the headset for $15 at Walmart. I've had this headset for about 3 years now, and it's also very important to me that this headset is durable. Other people in my house have sat on it, thrown it on the floor, and rolled over the cord with the chair, but it still works perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. =D",

I ordered this around mid-August for $159.99 and it arrived by USPS (mail) in a small cardboard box with Amazon tape on it.  After removing the cardboard box, I took out the actual HD PVR 1212 box and was impressed with the firm packaging.

(Doesn't happen often)<br />-USB is a bit short, but the component cable's length makes up for it.<br />-No HDMI slots (there are HDMI to Component cables though so it is alright)<br /><br />Conclusion<br />--------------<br />Excellent product, really glad I bought it!

That's great but thanks to Litecoin, and Bitcoin miners, the 290x is pretty much the same price as the 580 ti now. Price advantage gone.<br />Also AMD fan boys will exclaim how mantle has a bright future. That it alone, will make it a worthy by over Nvidia. Well the problem with that is simple, AMD had said it will work with Nvidia to license Mantle. So advantage in technology gone.<br />This card is just amazing, and the reviewers that say different are either, AMD fanboys, got unlucky and got a defective card (happens with any card) or they are bottlenecked by their CPU, don't get the performance and thinks it's the graphics card due to poor tech knowledge.<br />During the Elder Scrolls Online beta, my 290X, during large scale PVP battles, I am talking too many people to count on screen, got eaten alive, I'm talking dropping to 5 frame rates. Now, you will hear some people say differently, but it my case, it was horrible. There was also nothing wrong with the card, and my processor was overclocked to 4.7.<br />So, I used the 780ti, and let me say, the large scale PVP battles, were as smooth as butter over 80fps. I don't have a 144mhz monitor for nothing, I expect a silky, smooth look, with maxed out settings. The 780ti was able to do this, and the 290x got eaten alive.<br />Also there were other periods in the game, during PVE, where the 290x would struggle and drop frame rates again, random dips, with fog. The 780 ti never showed a slight drop in frame rates my whole play through. This is just one example, of many, where the 780ti is the best card.<br /><br />So the choice is simple, you wait, and upgrade when Maxwell comes out in full force. Or you buy this right now. If you want the best game experience, this is the very best card you can buy.<br /><br />Don't pay attention to the lack of availability of the 290x. That isn't a sign, it's a great card, or gamers are buying it like hotcakes. The bitcoin and litecoin miners, are buying all the cards out. To put into mining rigs.<br />All of that sums up to, 780ti is the best card money can buy right now, if price is not a concern.<br /><br />If money is a concern, but you want a high end card? I still feel the 780, is a better choice over the 290x, even if the 290x's price wasn't inflated. It uses less power, runs much cooler, and is many times faster.<br />Please keep in mind, I have a Nvidia rig, and my brother has a AMD rig I built myself. I'm only going off what I have seen for myself. I'm a fan of Nvidia despite their infamous price gouging for a reason, the results in my personal experience. Those are different with people.<br />For instance my 8350 fx, I love it to death, and runs like a dream at 4.7mhz. I suffer no bottleneck either. Intel fanboys would disagree with me completely. However, my results are my results, and I don't hate AMD.he 290x. That isn't a sign, it's a great card, or gamers are buying it like hotcakes.

Those are different with people.<br />For instance my 8350 fx, I love it to death, and runs like a dream at 4.7mhz. I suffer no bottleneck either. Intel fanboys would disagree with me completely.

It also has a parent mode that allows you to put the apps you permit your child to use in the Nabi mode which gives parents piece of mind knowing that their children can't surf you tube starting with videos like &#34;what does the fox say&#34; and ending with trailers for the next sultry Megan Fox movie. It comes with many apps which are suitable for our younger boy who is 4, but has the ability to download more age appropriate apps from Amazon.  There is also plenty of information provided by Nabi at their official website for any troubleshooting you may have, i.e. updates, restarts.  The Nabi 2 is super durable has more than enough memory and processor speed to keep even an adult satisfied.  I would also note that the Nabi is much better than the Toys'r us tablet. A friend of the family had owned the Toys'r us version but returned it due to quality and functionality issues.  If you are hesitant to buy your child a tablet because you think they will outgrow it, destroy it, or flat out not use it, don't worry you will not have buyers remorse.  The only downside I have is the cable for charging the Nabi is somewhat flimsy and cheap and you must use a usb port to charge, but we have had no issues charging yet.",

But after many hours of use this is how reality pans out as far as it's usefulness goes.  <br /> <br />Here's my usage situation:  <br />I have complimentary dsl internet provided by my neighbor across the street who let me plug the wireless router in to her connection, placing it in the window. I have the usb adapter on my desktop and the card in my laptop, both about 160ft from the router through two stucco walls.  <br /> <br />Most days the WG511 laptop card is lucky to be getting 50% signal strength no matter where I move or place it in the room. (which is quite limited due to having to actually be able to use the keyboard on the laptop. Better signal is useless if you have to hold the laptop over your head to get it.) <br /> <br />At 50% to 80% signal strength the card limits the webs speed & is drasticly reduced to in my opinion, barely acceptable. (Although it is still better than dial up) <br /> <br />While the USB adapter in the same room almost always has 75% or above signal strength, occationally needing a minor turn or adjustment of less than an inch movement to dial it in to it's best. So in reality, most of the time when I don't want butt slow internet I have to unplug my USB adapter and use it instead of the poor performing WG511 laptop card.  <br /> <br />Even when the WG511 is getting a useable signal, I found it is unstable because when you sit in front of the laptop and place your hands on the keyboard, (near the side card bus slots on my laptop) you using it, often also interfears with the signal. Get up and walk away and it returns to useable. (Alot of good that is) If you have a choice, & it matters, go with a usb adapter (on a usb cable) for best signal performance useability. <br /> <br />On the positive side: <br />The WG511 was simple enough to use and setup for me. <br />And it does perform well for transfering files between my desktop and laptop (or visaversa) when used in computer to computer \\\\\"ADHOCK\\\\\" mode. Although it's faster even then if I take the laptop across the srteet and do it there. The signal recieving capability of the WG511 is just kinda weak I guess. And it worsens the farther you get from the router with little option for adjustment or improvement.  <br /> <br />If I had it to do all over again, I'd have just bought two USB adapters.Hope you find this info helpful to your situation <br /> <br />",

I tried a Seagate 1TB 32MB SATA drive, and thought that was working, but after a couple of days I got the random \\\\\"Device Removal\\\\\" warnings. Wasn't as frequent as with the WD Caviar Green, though.    I tried the \\\\\"SIIG Cool Dual SATA to USB 2.0\\\\\" dock ([...]) with the Seagate drive and it worked fine, but the fan was too loud to have by the computer.    I finally switched to the Kingwin \\\\\"EZ-Dock 2\\\\\" dock ([...]) which doesn't have a fan, and it has worked fine so far.     Summary: Kingwin + Seagate seems like the winning combination for external SATA docks. The Bytecc SATA/USB external docking station has problems with Leopard. The WD Green drives might also have general problems, I'll see if I can test it with the Kingwin now. The WD Green did seem quieter than the Seagate.    Hoping the next iMac has an ESATA port. Wonder if a firewire instead of USB external dock would be faster. [yes, I bet it would be, but I can't find any docking stations like this that have firewire]",

The grey pattern on a black background is a nice, subtle design and should appeal to many. The fabric has a nice feel, and even though it's squishy, the case feels like it would protect the Kindle from most impacts. Since I don't buy or use leather products, and many other non-fabric cases have a smell (this one doesn't), I'm glad that there's another option. The case is very light-weight and features an indent on the front where the strap fits securely when closed. Unfortunately, the hands-free design only works in landscape mode and not on portrait which is how I prefer to read. However, it worked quite well on my counter when I had to use it for a recipe and the silicone held perfectly fine. The ports and on/off button are easily accessible, so no problems there. For once I believe the price is reasonable, and unlike others I've come across, the quality is top-notch so I'd definitely recommend this Built case for your Kindle.",

The cap doesn't cinch down when on the back and considering it sits the the crook of your thumb is very prone to spinning itself loose. The angle on the clip is much too sharp to use smoothly so inserting/removing the stylus from the edge of a pocket takes 2 or 3 seconds longer than it should.<br /><br />As a sidenote the tip of mine bent after only a few days use then broke off completely when I tried to bend it back.

I'm a graduates student who frequently uses research databases for multiple purposes. This is seriously the issue that sent me over the edge with this device. It's usefulness has since reduced to simply reading pdf files that I've downloaded on separate devices.<br /><br />For not much more you can purchase a quality device that can accomplish much of what the Kindle fire can, and more.<br /><br />I have been a loyal customer of Amazon's and I truly hope they give me a reason to keep this device before I can manage to upgrade to something better.",

Caps lock indicator on the keyboard.  What I don't like:  The case and keyboard got bigger adding more bulk. Abound 1/2\\\\\". It doesn't sound like much, but after using the original case it feels like a lot. (The iPad 2 is smaller than the iPad 1, so this is not a good feature)  The case is made of a slippery material. It's slipped out of my hand twice already. I don't like the way the material feels either. Kind of like wet fingers on a dry newspaper. *ick*  The ability to orientate is nice, but a pain when I'm trying to take notes. The iPad will move when writing, which can become a real annoyance.  The keyboard is made out of a hard plastic which doesn't give it much flexibility.   When the case is in the keyboard mode it doesn't have the same stability as the original case. It wobbles quite a bit when I use the touchscreen. It's not as good using it on my lap as the original case.  When I flip it around to put the iPad in reading mode it's very bulky. More so then the original case.  When I carry the case it feels awkward. Uneven somehow. It's hard to describe, but it was annoying.  All these issues were enough for me to go back to using the original case. With some strategic placement of thin bubble wrap, the original case will work just fine.  This case is actually very good and will work for most people. The keyboard is great and will let people whip up some really long emails.

I was initially annoyed by some loose spring-like noises across modifier keys (backspace,enter, and two shift keys, fortunately not spacebar), but I guess they (supported by metal bars underneath) constructed differently from other 83 keys, so I understood that. And once I began to use the keyboard and I got used to it and noises from the modifier keys didn't to seem to bother me much as it did in the beginning.    So far, I like the feeling of typing: stiff and solid. WASD customer service was also prompt and recommended me to use grease to dampen noises from modifier keys. I know Cherry Clear is not common, but I've always wanted to have a stiffer keyboard and think many people who want a stiff keyboard with less noise than blue/green may like it.

This laptop met all three of these needs for me. It came with enough RAM that I don't need to upgrade it until the 8GB of SODIMM modules become ridiculously cheap. The video chipset M96XT (AKA Radeon 4670) has pretty decent performance [...]. There are just way too many other laptops out there that have 1080p screens and an Intel GMA chipset, or low resolution 1280x800 screens with decent video chipsets. This laptop has both high resolution and a good chipset.    I recently took it to a LAN party to play Team Fortress 2 and it ran beautifully with all the settings turned up to high (60fps+). My last laptop died because the CFL backlight failed, with the LED backlight that should never be a problem. It's also super bright. I usually have it set to a quarter of the brightness and it's still pretty bright.    If you don't like the disk I/O speed (I think it's fine) you can always put a SSD in this as it's a standard SATA disk drive. There are USB ports on the left AND one eSATA/USB on the right, so you can use either one.

Previous to buying this, I was using the intel stock cooler on my i5-4670k (stock clock), and I saw temp reductions from 80-100C on BF3 to temps around 40-60C, which is an incredible improvement over the stock cooler. This comes with two of the SP-120L fans, and being a fan of the SP-120's I was happy to see this came with everything I needed to have it in push/pull.

The receiver inverts one set and combines it with the other, thereby cancelling any in-phase noise that is picked up along the cable, just as balanced audio cable does.  If you need extremely long cable, you may need heavier gauge cable.  If you move your components around frequently, you may want a more limp cable and you'll have to pay for it.

While high on the cool list, it's not very high on my business priority list; every purchase decision is a business decision. My 4 star rating is based on what I believe this technology can provide both amateur and pro photographers.     Understand that these chips provide the ability for peer-to-peer communications with another Wi-Fi device, namely a computer.  This is Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi data transfer is by it's very nature v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w. If you want faster transfer rates you will have to shoot tethered, using copper wire to transfer data from camera to PC.  Do not expect this technology to do more than it is capable of or you will be very disappointed.  I would respectively argue in that case that the problem is not so much the product or technology as your expectations.    I would not advise attempting to use this technology as a main method to upload photographs to a PC under all circumstances, and I do fault the company for advertising it as a workflow replacement for card readers without acknowledging it won't work in extreme circumstances such as continuous shooting mode. I personally would -=NEVER=- want it to delete the files once uploaded as one reviewer suggested!  What if something went wrong with the wireless transfer?  This would only be a viable solution if the images were not important to me (which is pretty much never).    This tool would be extremely useful in situations such as when teaching classes and giving demos - take the image, have it upload while you're talking, and setup Adobe Lightroom to automatically pull it in and project on the wall for discussion purposes. It would work equally well in a studio or school setting (or whenever you're doing mass photography of a line of people) such as described by another poster who was shooting dance school kids.  Iassume the image capture rate is slow enough to allow reasonable data transfer.  It's a nice replacement to tethered shooting in some situations. It is NOT a single solution for all things.

Even though today is 1/20/09 and we purchased the thing on 12/15/08 (that's just over 30 days ago), we'll have to pay $20 to have Netgear ship us a new drive so that we can then, ship the old one back. Now, $20 is a drop in the hat with all the equipment and it doesn't buy a happy meal from Micky D's for a family, but since when does purchasing a close to $2000 piece of equipment cost a penny more to fix when the hunk of junk doesn't work w/in a few days of having it up and running?

These involve the date of manufacture of the router, the date of purchase of the router, and the time period that has elapsed since purchase.  Prior to purchase of the product you are expected to ascertain the date of manufacture of the router.  Routers manufactured too far in the past, according to NETGEAR protocol, could invalidate your chances of getting installation assistance.  In that case, the installation assistance people will demand that you provide them with a copy of proof of purchase (i.e. the receipt) prior to them spending the 5 minutes helping you to set up your router.  If you do not have sufficient proof of purchase you will be invited to purchase, for approximately the cost of the router, an assistance plan where these same people will supposedly help you install your router.  The same applies to a time period (90 days was my case) between purchasing and attempting to set-up your router.  A delay in installation may make their promise of installation assistance invalid, according to their protocols, which of course you will not know at the time of purchase.<br /><br />Oh wait.

Might as well get the right stuff. This adapter is useless. I might as well buy a laptop that is compliant.<br />Here is why: To capture DV video, your computer must be able to connect to a DV device using IEEE 1394 (FireWire/i.Link). For detailed instructions on connecting your device, see your device documentation. Adobe Premiere Pro's built-in DV support relies on DV support in the operating system. To provide DV support through their operating systems, Microsoft requires IEEE 1394 interfaces that are compliant with the OHCI specification. Many computers include OHCI-compliant IEEE 1394 ports on the computer, and almost all current IEEE 1394 cards are OHCI-compliant. IEEE 1394 interfaces that are not supported by the operating system require their own presets, driver software, and plug-ins written specifically for Adobe Premiere Pro. If your computer does not have a built-in IEEE 1394 interface, you can purchase a hardware capture card that provides the interface (see your computer's documentation).",

For an experienced user, though, they are a great buy.  I have switched from using Cisco, Mikrotik, and others to using just these for most situations.  They don't handle roaming between AP's as seamlessly as Cisco, but they are 1/10th of the price.  They are suitable for everything but VOIP in this respect.  The controller is simple, but will handle most situations just fine.  I use them with multiple VLANs in many places with no issues.  I have also used them to provide WiFi coverage to the county fairgrounds with great success, and in a number of businesses.  They integrate well with their other Access Points, such as their UAP-outdoor and UAP-pro to provide a well-rounded solution suitable for most.

The Note 8 is comfortable to hold in the portrait and landscape position. I found the galaxy 8.9 and especially the iPad to be awkward and cumbersome to hold. In the landscape position I found it difficult to cover the entire space of the iPad and tab 8.9. I did like the size of the nexus 7 but chose to sell mine on Glyde to upgrade to the note 8. The Note 8 feels very comfortable to hold despite it being plastic. I do not have a problem with plastic phones or tablets because I always put a screen cover and case on my devices to protect them.<br /><br />SOFTWARE<br />I was not a fan of Samsung's earlier renditions of its Touchwiz interface on my galaxy tab (8.9). In fact, I still think that stock android is ideal but I just install the nova launcher app (see link below) and run that on top of Touchwiz which is the main reason to go with an android device, customization! I had toiled with the idea of purchasing the Note 8 because I thought it was overpriced. So after a trip to BB, I tried to force myself to get an iPad mini but still felt like I was using the same operating system I had on my iPod touch from 4 years ago. Apple might get better apps at first but they all migrate to Android eventually and Android has so many customization apps available it is hard to get bored. Apples control issues will be its undoing imo, and have severely limited what these devices are capable of doing. Does Samsung copy Apple? I think they do copy some aspects of Apple like the messaging app and touch keyboards looks eerily similar and the presence of a home button. I think Apple makes superior looking devices but Samsung and Android have superior software.<br /><br />DISPLAY<br />This is another reason I chose the Note 8 instead of the iPad mini which I also think is the perfect size. I strongly considered waiting for a retina display to come out for the iPad mini but could not justify moving backwards to an iOS device. Also after I put a iPad retnia display next to the iPad mini I did not notice enough of a difference to justify the added bulk and expense that comes with the retina display. The display on the Note 8 is absolutely gorgeous! It is one of the most vibrant screens I have ever seen.<br /><br />MISC<br />The s pen is an added bonus but the addition of an micro sd card slot that is not hidden inside the device is another reason not to overlook the Note 8. Both of these options make photo editing easier in my opinion. I have a micro sd card adapter in my camera and all I have to do is pop it in the Note 8 and photos are loaded into the gallery. The s pen is cool but I have not had enough time with the device to review its effectiveness. The multiscreen ability of the Note 8 is one of its better features. It has a limited amount of apps that function with the multi screen ability but all of the main ones like chrome browser, facebook, maps and all of the samsung apps function.  I purchased the device at BB and made sure they price matched the Amazon price.<br />CONCLUSION<br />I can honestly say that I am completely happy with my purchase and despite the high price of the Note 8 I feel that I did not want to compromise with my tablet.

The kindle is so amazing that one could not say enough! Some say they would preffer an ipad, because you can move the screen with a finger to this i say, the whole point of the kindle is to be more like a book, and i preffer the page turning buttons, which are placed just where one would turn the page of a book....for the money its a great deal. I say its like a star trek device because in star trek, you never saw anyone reading paper books rather reading or working off of a thin tablet device.

Although the Windows 8 operating system interface is quite different from the Windows Vista interface, with the help of the online tutorial I was able to comfortably navigate the system within a relatively short time. I have. however, encountered a few inconveniences, as follows:<br />1. My Internet Service Provider (ISP) uses Post Office Protocol (POP) for my e-mail account. However, the Windows 8 e-mail application is incompatible with POP. WIndows 8 does support Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and EAS; but my ISP doesn't support either of these protocols. Accordingly, I am not able to use Windows 8's sophisticated e-mail application unless I decide to change my ISP. In the interim I am able to access my e-mail account directly via my ISP's web page, and this works OK for now.<br />2. The documentation that comes with the Inspiron 660s is rather skimpy, consisting of a &#34;Quick Start Guide' plus 'Warranty, Safety, and Regulatory Information&#34;. For the most part, the steps outlined in the 'Quick Start Guide' are very simple and sufficient to enable the user to get started quickly. But this document doesn't indicate where the CD eject button is located or how to insert/eject a CD (either via hardware or software using the mouse); I had to discover this information via trial and error.<br />Overall, though, I am enjoying my Dell Inspiron 660s---it's a powerful little machine!",

I received 2 monitors one being a replacement for the 1st cross shipped net day air - ridiculously easy with Amazon.  Sadly that was my best experience with both of these monitors.  The first seemed great but was not pacakaged with additional shipping buffer.  The Styrofoam in the original case is this and the monitor seems to get pressure on it during shipping.  The first monitor had two broken corners in the top where you could touch is gently and hear 'click, click' as well as a discoloration corner to corner in the top left.  The second arrived with a speaker making a pop sound 2-3 times on bootup each time.  None of my other speakers used with this exact same configuration have ever done this.  The monitor is connected via its native displayport to displayport on my radeon 6850HD.  There is no such cable that comes with this monitor even though the native output is via the displayport.  Instead they provide you with a mini-display port to displayport cable, a DVI-D and HDMI wiith Ethernet. They also provide a green aux to aux cable for speaker output from a different source than the display output if needed.<br /><br />The second monitor Seemed ok other than the speaker issue which was annoying but ok I can deal with the occasional pop sound during a boot.  Nope, this carried onto youtube, Spotify, and any other music source I tried.  Also, I started to dork with the settings under the speaker bar and saw that the grid display is showing a single blown pixel in the upper right quadrant.  Amazingly enough the 1st monitor has this as well.  I thought to myself wow what are the odds.  *note* You do not see this &#34;blown&#34; pixel in normal display conditions. Only when switching to grid mode.  THis is not part of an alignment technique to my knowledge and is seemingly defective engineering.  You'd have to call ASUS but good luck.  I have had a rather poor experience withthem trying to return the monitor.  I presumed that this would be done by the manufacturer and not the vendor.  That was 7 days of non-sense in which they said I would be liable for repairs when I clearly requested a cross ship as the warranty of the device suggests is available for the first 30 days.  Finally I came to amazon who within 2 minutes of clicking had a cross ship next day air on the way.  It is my fault for not trying amazon first but I work with pos systems and almost 99% of the time any RMA is done with the manufacturer and not the distribution company.  Again my fault.<br /><br />In a nutshell - 2 defective monitors both with blown pixels in the top right quadrant visible in grid view.  One had pressure damage to the top left and right corners.  The second had a bad speaker with the same blown pixel.  Id try something else.  AOC is similar and less expensive.  Or suck it up and go with a 27&#34; WQHL which is the route I will be taking upon return.",

The Kindle is a space saver for those of us that have thousands of books already and no space available on the many book cases in our homes. The selections available for many of the authors we like may not be there, but it's a perfect time to select a new writer to put under your belt and read something that you thought about reading before, but never did.    The designers have provided ample font selections for those of us that need large print, the ease of turning the page, a built in dictionary (would have preferred Webster), slender enough for a purse, brief case or shoulder bag.

I am very tired of hoisting my laptop and bag over my shoulder to go down to Starbucks for some relaxing web-browsing away from the furkids on the weekends.  The 7 inch Fire goes right into my purse and it is very easy to handle in a sitting position.  I use the landscape view, so the power button was never an issue for me.  Don't need the memory card, can't possibly read 1,000 books in my lifetime (I'm 53), so that isn't an issue either.    No children, so no worries abt the password or privacy issues.  Dogs cannot use a credit card, another plus of four-legged creatures.   I hate retail shopping and do alot of buying over Amazon whenever I can.  For example, I buy my dogs all their bullysticks and dental chews from Amazon, it's much cheaper.  Already a prime member so it's a no-brainer to get a Fire.    I fly only 2-3 times a year, but now when I leave for x-mas, I will download a video the day before and have it for the flight.  Also my new Stepen King novel.  Will read and watch a few movies while at my mom's house, where there is no internet...just hop down to the coffee shop and download a few more if I run out.  Regarding the airlines, to me it's no biggie to rent...the airlines charge you 5 bucks to watch one of their mediocre movies on their inflight tablets, so I come out ahead any way you look at it.  And I won't do it often enough that it will become an expensive habit.  The picture is beautiful.  I'm using the cream background, larger margin and font on the e-reader, and am having no problems with eyestrain, but I only read a few pages at night before I go to bed.    This device may not be for customers who demand marathon and varied use from their tablet, but for the casual user, as a source of entertainment, it can't be beat.

However, after just 3 days of use the Sargas 320's microfiber top is already separating from the rubber base below. This clearly occurs because, unlike some mouse pads, the Sargas 320's top layer is not sewn around the perimeter to the bottom layer, instead relying on the adhesive substance between the two layers. This is insufficient to keep the mouse pad together. Overtime, this separation will worsen and catch on my wrist whenever I try to use this product (it does so already).<br /><br />Despite the durability issues, the glide of this mouse pad is very good. it is topped with a silky microfiber material which allows for a very smooth glide. The mouse pad itself is pretty thin (around 3mm tall)and lacks the rigidity of most any other mouse pad I have used so far (it will lay flat because it is so limp). The rubber bottom sufficiently holds the mouse pad in place on my plastic desk, and if it weren't for the fact that this pad is literally falling after just a few hours of use, this product would be a 4 or even 5 star one.",

Not only are they affordable for a 6-speaker system, but they sound amazing too. I'm not an audiophile or anything like that, so I don't know the nitty gritty details, but I trust my ears and they proved to be a huge improvement.<br />It took me a while to connect these things to the Audigy 2. Unfortunately the card's plugs arent color-coordinated with the speaker's cables, so it was somewhat of a challenge, but once I got it right I enjoyed listening to music a lot more than before.<br />These are surround-sound speakers. Unfortunately my setup doesn't allow me to place the rear speakers behind me, so I opted to put them on the side instead. Amazingly, it still sounds like surround sound.<br />The subwoofer is a welcome bonus too. I live in an apartment building, so I have to set the volume pretty low, but I can still feel the vibrations underneath my feet. I haven't tried it at full power, but I wager it would shake the wall on the opposite side of the room. It's incredible how much realism a subwoofer adds to a listening experience, especially with DVD movies.<br />I agree with the reviewer who said the blue light on the center speaker is annoying. If you like to watch movies or play games in a dark environment and the thing is right in front of your eyes, it distracts from the monitor. It's not a big deal though, I just put some black tape over it and I got back to enjoying the multimedia.<br />DVD's really sound good on these speakers. You can actually hear sound move from one speaker to another and cycle, depending on the movie. I've never had that experience with two speakers. In fact, you can hear sounds you've never heard before too! It's really amazing.<br />Games also sound great, though not all support six speaker systems. Most support four, and you can hear the difference, but the sound is still better than with two speakers. It's a fantastic consolation that games like GTA 3 and Vice City sound absolutely fabulous now. It actually feels like you have a sound system in the computer-generated car.<br />Now, they're not THX certified, as if I know what that means.

There seems to be an odd divide in the reviews I could find. Press reviews seem universally positive and tend to point out the numerous advanced features that you can only get from ReadyNAS. The user reviews are more mixed- 80% are consistent with the professional reviews and gush about the amazing new features while the other 20% were either testing a really early version of the operating system or maybe they just have an axe to grind.<br /><br />Anyway, set-up could not have been easier. With the ReadyCLOUD web portal, after powering up the device and connecting to my router, it was just a matter of clicking few buttons and I was up and running. Although the local admin page offers deeper functionality, this ReadyCLOUD offering is slick as I can now access my files and even create new shares from any browser, anywhere. As the local admin and ReadyCLOUD look almost identical, the only issue I encountered was keeping track of whether I was accessing my data locally or through the cloud.<br /><br />I had several years' worth of photos, videos and documents that I immediately moved to the device from a collection of PC's and USB drives. Transfers were zippy and I couldn't believe how little noise there was considering the box was performing under a fair amount of stress.<br /><br />For most of my data I went ahead and enabled to automatic protection through the cool snapshot feature. So far, I've only had to restore one file, but this feature could be a lifesaver if I ever accidentally delete the wrong file. It feels good knowing I can go back to file versions from any point-in-time. Having the files automatically protected against viruses is another bonus. I purchased a NAS because I wanted my data protected against any kind of device or drive failure. Between the automatic RAID protection, the snapshots andeven the anti-virus I have never felt more confident about the safety of my files.<br /><br />Aside from being a stable repository for my files, I use the ReadyNAS to stream media throughout my house. We have been using the built-in PLEX server and there have been no problems watching video files on the TV, laptops or mobile devices. Even better, my wife and I can watch different programs at the same time.<br /><br />I have only downloaded one app for the device, but I was shocked at how many were available and how easy they were to find and download.<br /><br />I was very much on the fence about investing in a NAS, but this ReadyNAS product has exceeded my expectations in every way.",

Then I looked at it from another angel and noticed that the screen appeared to be curved. So I took it out of the case and noticed that the left side of the iPad (which would be the bottom when inserted into the iguy) was completely bent in the shape of the bottom of the iguy, which caused the glass screen to pop out of the sliver casing of the iPad and distort the image/color on the screen.

Despite that, though, I would not deny the mouse if my laptop was black or another color. The silver is slick, and each of the colors are each really cool, appealing, vibrant, clear, and glowing. As in I don't tire in looking at them. The particular shades are pleasing. It's like whoever made it was me-- or had me in mind. Since it's perfectly cool just rotating colors, being able to control it to stay on a single color is a neat bonus feature. It is small and portable. It's also the perfect size for me--I have small hands. This mouse makes me happy. Every time I look at it I commend myself for my incredibly smart purchase, and for a good price, too. If it was for twice the price I would have been happy with my buy. I would say it couldn't have gotten better. It is the best mouse I could have chanced upon and it far exceeds any expectations I could have had.<br />Performance-wise, it is faultless. The clicks are quiet and the scrolling wheel simply works well, too. The laser actually impressively works on about any surface. It has a retractable cord which can be fixed at any length; this part might take a little practice. It doesn't make a difference, though, to how so very, very conveniently cool it is and all in all there is nothing whatever wrong with it. I'm glad I own it and I would be significantly, significantly disappointed if it was lost or damaged (what a despairing thought!).<br />Basically, I recommend this mouse.

It's small and light enough to fit in your shirt pocket (though I wouldn't recommend that) and it has a large, 500GB capacity!  The drive gets its power through the USB cable, so there is no separate power cable to carry or plug in - only a small USB cable (which is included).  Just plug the drive into your laptop or desktop computer's USB port, install the included encryption driver and go.  About the only thing not impressive about this drive is that it's not the fastest drive in the world - its speed is limited by both the USB 2.0 connection and the slow, low RPM (low power) drive itself - so the high capacity and portability has some trade-offs.  The included USB cable is really short (18\\\\\"), so if you need a bit more length, you'll have to purchase a separate USB to Micro USB cable.  Finally, just plugging the drive in prompts Windows to request for the installation of Western Digital's SES device driver to your PC.  The SES device driver handles the drive's optional 256-bit hardware encryption.  I have no use for the encryption, so I didn't wish to install the SES driver.  Unfortunately, if you do that, you'll be prompted to install the driver whenever you plug the drive in or restart your system.  I never allowed it to install and I don't want it to install so I disabled the SES device in Windows' device manager to stop the prompts.  The average person may not know how to do that.  All in all, if you can live with the relatively low speed, or if you want a portable drive with encrypted data, or you need to move or carry a lot of data or backups around, especially for a laptop, this may be the drive for you.",

I was still a little worried when I compared the dimensions of the laptop to the product dimensions listed on the Amazon product page. The Alienware M11x is 11.25 x 9.19 x 1.29 inches (LxWxH). For comparison a 13.3 inch MacBook is around 12.78 x 8.92 x 1.08 (LxWxH), which shows that this 11.6 inch laptop while not as long and rectangular is actually a little wider (from trackpad side to hinge side) than even an average 13.3 inch, making it a little more squarer even though the screen is 16:9 widescreen. This is what worried me.    When I compared the dimensions though...  The Alienware M11x is 11.25 x 9.19 x 1.29 inches (LxWxH).  And the description on Amazon says the \\\\\"Product Dimensions\\\\\" are 12.4 x 9.4 x 1.5 inches (LxWxH).    And yes, I realize that this is the PRODUCT dimensions as in the dimensions of the exterior, NOT what it can fit inside, which is why I was worried that it still might not be big enough.    However it came today, and surprisingly my laptop just barely fits, it's pretty snug right now but from what I've read in these reviews, if it fits a little tight it should loosen up a bit the more you use it, since the neoprene material is somewhat stretchy. Hopefully, this will happen for mine over the next few weeks.    After looking at the packaging though, it DOES have the \\\\\"Max Dimensions\\\\\" listed that WERE NOT LISTED on the Amazon page, so here they are for those of you who aren't sure if your laptop will fit: 11.8 x 8.7 x 1.5 inches (LxWxH). As I mentioned, though, my laptop is just under the max length and height but is actually .5 inches too wide (9.19 vs 8.7 inches) but it barely fits, still I wouldn't recommend this if you laptop is 9 inches wide or wider though, I'd say that is the absolute max, otherwise get the 13.3 version of this case. Also it'sworth mentioning that the packaging says \\\\\" 10-12.1\\\\\" Netbooks & Laptops \\\\\" which makes it sounds more like most laptops from 10 inch up to 12.1 inch max and less like this sleeve is made specifically for 12.1 inch laptops, which sort of makes sense, just thought I'd mention it.    As for the sleeve itself though, since it's just barely big enough for my laptop, I seriously doubt I could fit the power adapter or a wireless mouse in the outer pocket, which isn't a problem for me though because I bought this mostly so I can put the laptop in my backpack without having to worry about it getting damaged, and on the off chance I really need to take the power adapter I would probably put it in my bag separately anyways. I can definitely see myself using that extra pocket for some SD cards though or my USB cable/charger for my phone, so not totally useless. I should mention though, that this is the only extra pocket, so if you are looking to carry a bunch of stuff around with you in this thing, you might want to look elsewhere. And as for the \\\\\"smell\\\\\" that some people mentioned, I don't think it's necessarily a bad smell, I actually kind of like the smell, I'd compare it to the smell of the inside of a brand new pair shoes. And at least for mine, it's not as noticeable as some have mentioned, even if I put my nose up to it from 12 inches away I can't smell anything.    Overall, I really like it, I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to, and at a decent price. I am satisfied, and I would recommend this to someone looking for a little more protection when carrying their laptop around with them in a bag or backpack, or if you just want to use the handles, and aren't necessarily looking for an extra full on bag to carry around just for a laptop. However, make sure to check your laptop's dimensions and compare it to the \\\\\"max dimensions\\\\\" that I listed to see if this sleeve will be big enough for you.",

If I hear back from the seller, I will revise my review on this point.<br /><br />On another note, I didn't think that this was the most conveniently shaped car charger. My car charger port is recessed on the lower dash, The lower &#34;arm&#34; of the Trio Pace 5.1 is only 1 5/8&#34; long, which wasn't long enough to stick out of the recessed space.

For disaster recovery purposes, I have my SAN contents copied to two NAS units per volume for failover, with one set of NAS units always off-site.    This Sonnet looked like a good buy and I, too, was happy with the look. With five 750GB SATA hard drives mine is a 3TB solution using disk striping and keeping one drive as a spare. One issue with this unit is that, while it uses a multipath 3124 chip, only on Windows Server 2003 can you implement software based RAID-5. On XP you are limited to disk striping or mirroring using Disk Manager in Windows after your've made these PASS-THRU disks.    The biggest problem with this unit, however, is the poorly designed drive caddies and back-plane. These disks are removable, but they shouldn't be since the connection to the backplane is so 'iffy'. In fact, if I move this unit from one location to another I have to always re-seat one or more drives before the SATA card on the server or workstation can see it.    Unless you are willing to play with the drives, popping them in and out until you get a good connection with the backplane, I would pass on this unit. Much more reliable units are the MicroNet SR4 (4TB) SATA units available for under $800. They can take a lot more handling because the drives are integral to the unit. This means if a drive fails you live with it or send the entire unit back for repair, but I've not see any issues with these, especially if you use RAID-5 with the SilImage Raid program included. An array on these units configured as RAID-5 is recognized by Windows Server as a single volume which is what you want.    Also recommended are the Sans Digital TowerRAID TR5M-B units. They do have drive caddies, but are much better built. The trhoughput on these is much better than the earlier units Sans Digital put out.",

There were less bubbles but it was still bumming me out. At this point I figured I'd wait another day before removing it and calling the whole thing a failure. I'm glad I waited. All but maybe one micro bubble near the edge have disappeared and the shield feels great to the touch. Much better than the bare screen which didn't have the slick feel that the shield does.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like the company who makes this didn't do a very good job of preparing me for the process of waiting for the screen to heal. I did read all the other reviews of people saying the same thing and I guess I should have known it was going to take a while for the shield to heal to the screen but after reading all the 1 star reviews I became worried that I was in the same boat.

It dose add a little bulk but with how light and small the ipad mimi is its nothing noticeable at least for me i was use to caring my ipad 1 which also had a OtterBox Defender Series Case and lugging that around with me everywhere i went so the differences between that and this is amazing so I'm very happy.<br /><br />Now the reason for 4 stars and not 5 has to do with the area where you plug it in to charge its fine if your using the lighting cable that came with it but if you want to use an adapter you run into a problem and unlike my previous 2 defender cases that had the door that slid off making charging or placing it on a speakers really easy,  i find myself having to take the whole bottom apart which is really inconvenient. I also feel that the front cover /stand is a little bulkier than absolutely necessary but Im guessing part of the reason is it does make for a very sturdy stand which is a big improvement over the stand on my ipad 1 (defender Series Case).<br /><br /> Another new feature that i do like is the built in screen protector while i still feel a need to have a separate screen protector under it i like that if by chance some liquid gets spilled on it which has happened  to me with both my old and new ipads. the difference being with the old one i would be franticly taking it apart so the liquid doest get into the inside of my ipad because it does run under the plastic shel to the inside of the case so its is important to take it apart and make sure its all dry. I was really please that when i did spill water on my ipad mini while i did franticly take it apart the fist time to my surprise I found there wasn't even a drop of water inside totally dry now that wont be the case if you drop it in a bucket of water because the case is by no means water prof but if you spill just a little on the screen you should be safe because it all one pice so it doesn't run under to the inside of your case<br /><br />I really do love this case and would and do recommend it to my friends and would normally give it five stars except not being able to use an adapter with it easily has been kinda of annoying.",

Apart from the size it is way better image wise and more convenient to use than a normal TV. If we knew ahead of time that this would replace our TV, we would have gotten the 27in in a heartbeat. We'll probably cancel our cable TV subscription because of it.<br /><br />Pretty decent speakers: I was thinking I had to hook this up to a good speaker system. I was surprised that the speakers they come with are more than adequate for me. They're slightly better than our LCD TVs.<br /><br />Easy to use: with App Store and OSX, there's not much you need to do with Macs aside from installing more memory and general maintenance.<br /><br />Easy to move around: Light with a good form factor.<br /><br />Easy to upgrade memory. I recommend upgrading it to the full 16 GB right away for speed. If you don't know how, just look for videos on Youtube. That's what I did.<br /><br />Price: This is a way better deal than the 27in models in terms of pure price and speed. However I really want that extra 6 inches for the screen now, and I would have liked a larger hard drive.<br /><br />Fast: Assuming you have installed the extra memory (Crucial is a great dependable place to buy it from), this computer is pretty fast. The quad core processor is more than enough for my needs. I can work and play video games from Valve's Steam store and Apple's App Store.<br /><br />This is something most people already know about, but since this misconception is still out there, I want to add that - Yes, you can use 2 button mice. In fact Mac OS X has allowed the use of a 2nd mouse button (right click) for years now.<br /><br />Windows works fine on it. I use both VM Ware and Boot Camp for Windows games (though more and more games are coming out for the Mac ever since they switched to Intel chips).<br /><br />Apple stores provide training. They have both free classes and one on one training for $100 / year. This is really great if you suck at computers. If you're the family tech support person, this is also really really awesome. Ever since I converted my family to using Apple, I've had a lot less tech support calls from my family. Everyone wins.<br /><br />Beautiful: It's a nice sleek looking product.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />It is extremely hard to upgrade the hard drive. Too many parts to take apart. I highly recommend buying an iMac with as much space as you'll need. Yes it has a thunderbolt port, but it's new technology and as of right now there aren't many good external hard drives with this technology at a good price. As of today, it is hard to find anything decent below four hundred.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's another myth I'm going to have to destroy: \\\\\"Macs are virtually un-hackable\\\\\". Yes Macs are inherently more secure than Windows XP because of its Unix / BSD background, and also if you only use Apple's App Store to install apps. However it isn't foolproof and its growing popularity will make it a nice target for hackers. In fact it's already happening and I would be surprised if Apple can keep up with the threats without ultimately recommending virus & spyware protection. You need to install anti-virus software now. (Just don't install Norton garbage or anything from Symantec.) Still it's less maintenance than a PC. (I still own and use Windows machines - XP and Win 7)<br /><br />Since we're on the subject of security, by default Macs aren't setup to be more secure. It's a good idea to change the settings to enable the built-in firewall, as well as a user login, and creating a separate account admin privileges (and disabling admin privileges for everyday use accounts - yes this is annoying but it will save you a lot more headaches in the long run). They have videos on Youtube to do this.<br /><br />If you're interested in the latest and greatest hardcore PC video games, you're not going to be happy with a Mac. You'll probably have to get a Windows PC. In myopinion, this is one area I think that will still take a few years more for Apple to catch up with MS. Both the Apple App Store and Valve's Steam are making this less of an issue.<br /><br />I don't know why but I don't really like the Magic Mouse or the wireless keyboard that came with it, so I just bought a larger wired Apple keyboard and I use a cheap Microsoft mouse with scroll wheel. The 2nd mouse button and scroll wheel work great!<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This is perfect for a dorm, but if you're beyond college I would highly recommend splurging a little extra for the 27in iMac and getting one with a bigger hard drive. It is totally worth it as a replacement for the TV in the bedroom. I hope that they eventually will make a 32in version one day.",

Just read the title and price. That alone should tell you why it is &#34;slow and cheap&#34;. Those of you complaining that a FIFTY DOLLAR COMPUTER is slow, compared to a regular computer (around 800$ for a good one, if you dont know what a good computer is). go to google, find a good computer, and compare the specs. Buying this computer and expecting it to run fasd is like buying an old nokia phone from the 90's and expecting it to do everything an iphone does. You cant possibly expect this to run fast and perfectly, can you? I mean come on, 2 GB of RAM, windows XP, 1.8 GHz dual core processor? The list just goes on and on. The only reason i rated this computer 5 stars even though it is old and slow is because, remember, I am practicing building computers at home to keep my skills sharp which it is perfect for! In conclusion, if you buy this product to practice your building skills, this is perfect. pre-built, cheap, all parts needed (other than a monitor and VGA cable if you want to see if you built it right and see if it runs). However, if you intend to buy this for everyday use, dont waste your money. Please dont give this a bad review if its slow, the specs are all here. They dont lie to you, they dont cheat you, yes, we know its slow, its supposed to be. Thank you for reading my review, and have a good day.",

            "input": "This is an extensive review that compares this Seagate 2 TB Hard Drive with many other hard drives that I have owned.  I do own this Seagate Hard Drive.  I also present insight into the performance of this Hard Drive compared to what else is available.<br /><br />For the last 5 years, I've purchased only Western Digital brand hard drives.  I've owned 2 WD Passport external hard drives (750 GB 3.5\\\\\" & 320 GB 2.5\\\\\"), 3 1TB Caviar Green drives, 1 1TB Caviar Black drive, 2 1.5TB Caviar Green drives (64 MB cache & 32 MB cache versions), and 1 320 GB WD drive.  All of these have worked or still are working flawlessly.  I have not experienced a single drive failure or overheating problem.  I have run these drives in an LG NAS Blu-ray unit, a desktop, and as external storage for 2 laptops, and even a DVD player with USB. I am overjoyed with Western Digital hard drives and do not plan on using other brands.<br /><br />5 years ago, I owned a Seagate Hard Drive that failed the week after the limited 90 day warranty ended.  I lost all of my data and was offered no compassion from Seagate.  I had to junk the drive.  Luckily I had a stack of DVDs backing up about 90% of my files.  So my past experience with Seagate is not very positive, but I will give this drive a non-bias review.<br /><br />I always recommend using additional methods of data back-up for irreplaceable files, storing the back-ups in different physical locations (office, home, parents' house, etc).  I have recently invested in a Blu-ray Recorder as prices for BD-R discs have dropped to about $0.10 per GB - comparable to Hard Drive storage prices at the time of writing this review.  At 25GB per Blu-ray disc, this is an ideal media for storing back-up files off site - very easy to transport or ship.<br /><br />I was given this Seagate 2 TB Hard Drive and thought that a review would be helpful because of my extensive experience with other hard drives.<br /><br />1) 2 TB data.  Great storage size. Not much to say here.  Price per GB is comparable to other brands.<br /><br />2) 32 MB cache size. This is the standard cache size at the time of writing this review.  However recently a 64 MB cache size has been released.  For about the same price per GB of this Seagate drive, I purchased a WD 1.5TB with 64 MB cache size (bought on sale).  I recommend a higher cache size because it allows for faster data transfer speed.<br /><br />3)  5900 RPM disc spin.  Non-\\\\\"eco\\\\\" hard drives spin at 7200 RPM for significantly faster data transfer rates.  5900 RPM does reduce heat and energy consumption and is acceptable for hard drives that are used to store files, and not to run software.  Seagate gets a positive review for a relatively fast \\\\\"eco\\\\\" spin rate - faster than the traditional 5400 RPM.  However Western Digital has been using a variable spin rate of 5400-7200 RPM in their Caviar Green drives for over 2 years.  \\\\\"Better late than never\\\\\" is a good slogan for this Seagate drive.<br /><br />4) Reported high failure rate of this drive.  My own Seagate 2 TB drive is running without problems as an eSATA connected external HDD.  However this HDD has been plagued with reviewers experiencing disc failure - with approximately 30% of reviewers reporting drive failure.  Compare this to Western Digital drives that show about 1-2% drive failures from Amazon.com reviewers.  30% is far too high.  Maybe Seagate needs to modify their hardware or perhaps Amazon's \\\\\"frustration free packaging\\\\\" is at fault.  Either way, a failure rate this high must be taken seriously by Seagate and buyers.<br /><br />5) Loud noise for an \\\\\"eco\\\\\" hard drive.  Eco drives are designed to run on low power with a lower noise compared to faster spinning hard drives.  Compared to my Wester Digital drives, which I cannot even hear spin in my NAS unit, this Seagate is louder.  Not louder than a standard 7200 RPM drive, but louder than comparable eco-drives that spin around 5400 RPM.<br /><br />My personal conclusion is that this hard driveis just a run-of-the-mill hard drive that has started out on the wrong foot.  High failure rates, average performance scores, and nothing to set it apart from the competition.  Personally, I have been overjoyed with the performance of my Wester Digital hard drives.  This Seagate has given me nothing to get excited about.  So I will continue to be faithful to Western Digital and recommend WD until my own experience convinces me otherwise.igh failure rates, average performance scores, and nothing to set it apart from the competition.

The microphone is also superb, letting your voice come clear and crisp and the sound quality is good, although you won't get the bass or sound quality that you'd expect for avid music virtuosos. The lifespan of these headsets for me have been approximately 3 years a piece or so (one of mine broke due to misplacement that caused physical damage).

However, Centrafuse Localizer software allows to work with Arcpad mobile GIS software, but this software is sometime buggy. I have tested the geolocation accuracy which results very aleatory (in comparison with DGPS and even with a classic garmin trecking GPS).<br /><br />It is also important to notice that the Intel Atom Z3740 is basically a 1,33 GHz procesor and not a 1.86 GHz (as stipulated by Amazon specs): see http://ark.intel.com/products/76759/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z3740-2M-Cache-up-to-1_86-GHz",

This stand is terrific.  I use it for my third generation iPad.  You can use your iPad in portrait (my preference) or landscape mode.  More importantly, the Satechi allows you to position your iPad at the super-precise height AND angle you want.  Most stands will give you just a few limited options as to viewing/working angle, and few out there allow you to choose a perferred height.  The stand is very sturdy, so it won't tip over (unless you try to position your iPad at some ridiculous angle of something like 10-20 degrees so that you're trying to set your iPad almost parallel to your desk, but who's going to do that anyway?).

My older TP-Link suffered from stability issues from day one (even after loading DD-WRT), needing near weekly reboots. Additionally, in my 3 story home the TP-Link required placement on the main floor in order to provide coverage to the furthest areas of my smaller (~2200 sq ft) home's Foscam cameras. Even then, the connection to these cameras was laggy and unstable.<br /><br />Upgrading to this router changed that. I was able to place the router back in the basement utility closet (with the rest of my tech gear), and the range and throughput to my remote foscams is excellent, with very limited lag. Additionally, the one time I had internet connectivity issues, the router's firmware helped me identify the issue as being related to my CenturyLink modem.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my short-term gains from upgrading to this router.",

It is indeed a full fledge computer with a side order of \\\\\"tablet\\\\\".<br /><br />Of course, we all reserve the right of playing with many different toys!  I have.  One thing I like about tablets is the \\\\\"app player\\\\\" function.  With Windows 8, this slate has it too.  The app variety is small compared with Android, and infantile compared with iThings, but it is growing and so far quality is trumping quantity.  There is also a program called BlueStacks which enables android apps in windows.<br /><br />Then there is the computer side.  This baby can do anything my laptop can do (it even includes the free docking keyboard).  Touch screen and uber-portability are awesome features.  All my programs from many years back work flawlessly.  Using a stylus helps with the less in-your-face touch menus in the desktop side.<br /><br />Regarding the storage capacity, 32GB great for tablets but is not a lot for computing, but there are several ways around it. The easiest and cheapest is to use its full size SD card slot.  Fast cards are priced very reasonably; you can double the storage capacity for less than $20. I have gone as far up as 64 GB with not compatibility issues.  For the geekier crowd, changing the internal drive for a much bigger one is not very difficult and increasingly affordable.<br /><br />This slate deserves 5 stars in form, functionality and reasonable price point.",

The Kindle is snug enough that it doesn't slide around inside it, and both the cloth parts and faux leather parts of the outside of the cover feel good on the hands.<br />4) Fits the Kindle DX well.  In fact, even if you have the Kindle in a silicone sleeve it will still fit (very snugly) inside the case.  (But the silicone sleeve is unnecessary if you have the case, I took mine off.

We give it 4 instead of 5 for 3 reasons: while we like the size of the tablet and holds nicely in your hand for reading, it's thicker and heavier than we thought it would be. Lighter than our previous Fire HD but a bit heavy/bulky for a small tablet/device. Similarly, the Amazon cover has an odd fit. The edge of the device is slightly exposed above the edge of the cover and I've never seen a cover that fits likes that. The face cover (the origami portion) folds over it but isn't flush to the edge. It's just kind of weird. Finally, the touchscreen does not seem as responsive as our previous Fire HD or other tablets/devices we own or have owned. As some other reviewers have indicated it seems to take multiple touches sometimes. Also, the glide function doesn't work nearly as well as it did on the previous model, could be due to screen size but more likely related to the responsiveness issue.    All that being said we are very satisfied with the device as a whole. The size is good (like I said it's comfortable to hold), the screen resolution is excellent and the cameras are adequate. It boots up WAY faster and the new OS is a big step forward (even though Amazon gives you less control over device settings now it seems) and reading on it is a good experience overall. No, the sound is not as good as the EXCELLENT Dolby stereo sound on our other model, but better than my phone and smoother quality than my iPad Mini, though not as loud.",

I am not a big apple fan so wasn't interested in an ipad, had considered a google tablet but read mixed reviews on some aspects of it, so I decided on the Kindle Fire HD. I did have some concerns.  I had tried one out at a kiosk at a mall around Christmas time and it seemed clunky (slow, screen freezing) and some of the reviews are negative with comments on charging issues and inability to connect via Wifi.  Still, I took a risk knowing I could return it thru amazon.<br /><br />Delievery is perfect when ordered thru amazon, it is already setup for you on your amazon account.  Email, facebook, twitter apps all easy to setup and default to your login's so you just tap the icon and you are in your account.  Netflix App - works great.  A coworker and I were on a business trip, he with his ipad, me with my kindle. I watched several netflix movies over the hotels Wifi (some freezeups as it streamed but nothing beyond minor annoyance).  His ipad couldn't stream anything at all.  We were in adjacent rooms so we should have been nearly the same distance from the wireless router.<br /><br />I've also downloaded a number of movies via Amazon and they play back great. First one I downloaded the HD version and it looked great, but true HD costs $1 more.  Next movies I downloaded were SD movies and they looked just as good.  I also like that I can connect an HDMI cable from the kindle to my TV.  I do this in hotel rooms on business travel - super cool.  On airplanes the small screen is just fine and the sound thru headphones is great. SD movies also download a lot faster. HD took about 8 hours, SD took about an hour.  Just plan ahead of course.<br /><br />I find web surfing to be sufficient on the silk browser. If you try to tap links too quickly before the page fully loads it might lock up and have to be restarted. Don't know if this is the fault of the browser or the kindle. The biggest hurdle is the smaller screen but zooming in is intuitiveand fast.<br /><br />the only true negative I would say is I'm not thrilled with Amazon prime's options of free movies. I didn't realize at first you could only stream them, not download and watch later.  And their selections are not much different, certainly not any better, than Netflix.  I will likely cancel amazon prime.  What IS the differentiator over Netflix is the options for downloading just released movies that were recently in the theater. You can get those without amazon prime.  Trust me, I really wanted to appreciate amazon prime but if you have a Netflix account it is not much different (well, the free two day shipping I suppose but I rarely need something that bad - not worth $80 a year).<br /><br />I will agree that lack of any written directions is odd and although I consider myself tech savy, accessing some things was not obvious. I did figure it out via reading posts online. Others have complained about the power button and volume tabs being flush with the device so they are hard to find.  Trust me, get a cover/case for the kindle and most of them have touch points that make it pretty obvious where the buttons are.  I'd think even without a case you eventually learn. I found it frustrating at first too and after 5 weeks the buttons are a breeze to find.<br /><br />I think a front and rear facing camera would be an improvement, but I have taken a lof of pics with the camera pointed forward, just have to know where the button is to take the pic on the screen.  It can be awkward but do-able. I post a lot more pics on facebook now!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.  Ideal if you want it for light web browsing and entertainment (movies, tv shows).",

To start, the mouse is both wired and wireless, offering a hybrid form of charging the onboard battery on-the-fly, without disrupting game play.  Above all, the actual construction of the mouse it's self is my favorite part, offering up quality responsiveness and a good weight with quality componentry - even the scroll wheel is a metal wheel rather than a plastic one.  The mouse has a few adjustable features including the mouse feet, but overall the size and fit of the mouse should be solid for those with very large hands or small alike.  I myself have wide, thick hands and find the feel just find with no stress on any specific joint or tendon.<br /><br />The responsiveness of this mouse is another great feature and is completely programmable within the Intellipoint software - Which should be downloaded new rather than using the generally outdated versions that come prepackaged.  With the 3 sensitivity settings (adjusted by the 3 buttons under the scroll wheel) you can make on-the-fly changes in game to use the desired sensitivity with little hassle.  The battery gauge on the thumb side of the mouse displays batter life and mouse sensitivity visually, letting you know the exact DPI the mouse is currently using.  This mouse does not need a special pad or surface, but I did purchase the WOW!Pad @ [...] and find the surface is perfect for high precision game play and twitch-style gaming.<br /><br />Lastly, I keep the receiver quite close, being within 24\\\\\" of the mouse, but even at greater distances the responsiveness of the wireless action was superb and rivaled the responsiveness of the Logitech and Razer mice I've used in the past.  As far as quality goes, I'd much rather use the X8 than any other current gaming mouse that I've found.  Not one other mouse offers the same feature base with the quality to go along with, and this after I've gone through 4x Razer Diamondbacks, 4x Logitech G5s and numerous other mice over the years.  I'm hoping I've found the last mouse I need to buy, or at least until a further updated version arrives!

These are crystal clear and lay down great! Let me just say that I have put on 20+ screen protectors such as these and can now get them on quick and easy with no air bubbles or particles under it, in fact you cannot tell they are even on there when I'm done! I have found that first it starts with a good product like these, then its all in the application! I use a very simple method using filtered water ( straight out of the pure drinking water filter) and here is how I do it.    Perfect results Installation:    Step #1 Wash your hands and the area where your working by wiping down and making sure its clear of any animal hair, lint, dust etc.    Step #2 Rinse a container large enough to fit your protector in submerged and fill with filtered water (like a plastic glad container)    Step #3 Get everything your using for the instal including the protector and product wiped down with a damp cloth (like a well rinsed dish cloth)    Step #4 Next rinse your hands really well under the sink and again with a little filtered water.    Step #5 Using the filtered water on your damp hands rinse the screen on your product (if it has any skin oil or is dirty use a drop of dish soap first and rinse repeatedly then start again at the top) do this like your swiping like a windshield wiper (don't worry about a little water on you device it wont hurt it!)    Step #6 Next: There are three layers of plastic on each protector the first labeled \\\\\"step one\\\\\" take of now, it is the bottom throw away layer! and then use the filtered water in container to rinse the protector just like you did the product screen but this time you can fully submerge the protector to make sure you have cleared any dust or particles from it making sure the bottom surface is absolutely clean by using a wiping motion with your hand repeatedly.     Step #7 Apply filtered water to your now cleaned product screen with your damp hand and with the protector dripping wet straight out of the water set it on to your device and center it. next use a squeegee working your way from the center out pushing the water and air out (i use a little rubber squeegee to do this but a thin peace of plastic with a straight smooth edge like a battery cover off a TV remote works just as good)    Step #8 If you screw up and there is something under the protector like a peace of lint or particle or its not on straight, don't worry just take it off and start over by washing thoroughly and re-applying it as many times as it takes making sure to rinse and fallow the above steps again, these protectors are fully reusable! You can even go back and fix an old application using this method.    Step #9 Make sure you get all the air and water pushed out the best you can. If you can see a tiny water bubble or two don't worry, it will evaporate after a couple days. FYI: Stubborn air bubbles I have found are usually lint or a particle and require a redo.    Step #10 Carefully pull the top protective layer of plastic off leaving the center thicker protector in place. Next dry everything and your done! Shweew you did it! :). Again remember there are three layers to each protector the bottom and top are thinner and get thrown away they are just there to keep the middle \\\\\"Screen protector\\\\\" clean.    Sounds like allot LOL but it really is simple if you just get and keep everything clean.    Hope that helps.    PS: With a sharp pare of scissors you can cut the extra two protectors into screen protectors for your camera, phone or whatever... just make sure when you cut, that you hold them bottom side of the protector down and also mark (a thin sharpie marker works good) top/bottom before you cut ;)",

Now I actually have 2 Firewire 800 ports and 1 more Firewire 400. Great speeds, transfer test I did had a sustained 80MB/sec on the firewire 800, which is pretty close to the max of 100 MB/sec.     I didnt even use the manual or cd, but i did change to the larger bracket on the card (since it came installed with a small one on) to fit inside my computer properly.

I was pleased with the sound quality - good mid and bass response, quite an upgrade from the soft and tinny sound from my Macbook's internal speakers. Of note; the USB connector cord is built-in, with a finite length. You cannot readily substitute a longer generic cord.  This should not be much of a problem.    Finally, when sitting on my couch, with my Macbook opened fully, I sometimes cannot get the best angle for viewing the screen. A squirm sometimes cures that, but again, it's something to consider, depending on how far your laptop opens, screen viewing offset, etc.    Logitech designs and builds quality products, and this is no exception.  It is solid, with excellent fit and finish of all components. If the size, weight, and viewing angle issues are not problems for you, the improved sound, unit cooling, and comfort make for a good upgrade alternative to the \\\\\"fan-only\\\\\" type of unit.

The 970 on almost max settings in assassins creed held at about 45-50 fps. That's not even in SLI! If your are on the fence about getting this monitor I would say go for it, you can't get a better brand or sexier picture.

So we tried the drive directly, using SATA to USB and power connectors, and it showed up, which suggests the problem must be in the enclosure.

It's a matte black plastic with a rubber look/feel. The Apple logo will shine through the plastic, but not very noticeably in a bright room (or outdoors) or when you have the screen brightness turned down. The biggest downside is that the plastic shows fingerprint smudges... I can live with that, I guess... just need to wipe it clean everything now and then. I'm not a big fan of the 4 rubber feet on the bottom, they add a little unnecessary thickness the MBP (although it might help with cooling by allowing more air circulating) ... I'd rather they left 4 holes for the MacBook's built in feet to stick through.<br /><br />THE FEEL:<br />I like the rubber'ish feel of the plastic. I don't like that there are some sharp edges around the side of the case (sort of like little sharp edges left from how the case was made... I've tried filing them down a little and that helped some).<br /><br />Overall it does the job of keeping the case protected. I may not use it forever, but for now its fine.",

Inside the main compartment, there is a paded pocket big enough to hold the stated laptop sizes. I am using an 11.6\\\\\" laptop. Inside this pocket is a smaller velvet-lined pocket meant to hold an ipad. In front of the padded pocket is an unfortunately narrow pocket. I am able to fit a medium size study guide into this pocket at least, but it looks like it was meant mainly for holding papers. On the front of this pocket are two netted pockets. Then there is an open expandable space (there is a zipper along the outside to expand it). On the front side of this expandable pocket is a good sized zipper pocket.    On the outside of the bag, there are two stretchable pockets on either side meant for holding umbrellas/thin water bottles. There is a similar stretchable pocket on the very front that you could stuff some stuff into. Behind this front stretchable pocket is a small zippered pocket with two more velvet-lined pockets (meant for smartphones probably) and two pen/holders.    There is a net pocket on the inside of the flap that covers the backpack. I just stuff my sunglasses into this. I really like the flap on the top because it will prevent rainwater from dripping inside the bag through zippers as occurs on most other backpacks.    The greatest things about the backpack are its solid build quality and high quality materials. It is also very lightweight and I can carry around the same amount of stuff as before but because of the way the backpack wears it is so much more comfortable on my back. I haven't expanded the main section yet, so I don't know how much bulkier the backpack will appear when done so. I suspect I will have to expand it though because Im not able to get my 1 L nalgene water bottle into the pocket as is with my books in there.    I highly recommend this backpack. It will help tremendously with your comfort level if you are caring around a laptop and some books.",

PROS:  - Very flexible storage setup that can grow with your needs  - Protects effectively against drive failures (or so I've read)  - Looks good even in plain sight in your living room  - Polite and efficient customer service  CONS:  - In 18 months, three drives have \\\\\"failed\\\\\"! I say \\\\\"failed\\\\\" in quotes because the drives work fine in other housings and therefore will not be replaced under manufacturer warranties.  - Flaky software that causes it to \\\\\"disappear\\\\\" from your network and often requires a reboot of your Drobo and/or computer  - Slow transfer speeds (covered by other reviewers)  - Suspect quality of components (my generic branded AC adapter failed after 14 months)  - Expensive DroboCare program  Bottom line is that it feels as though Drobo might not as reliable and robust as you expect a back-up storage solution to be. My advice would be to weigh up your needs and preferences make a decision based on the specific strengths and weaknesses of each product (and read the reviews).",

            "input": "This is certainly a marvelous little unit and just what I needed to add to my Toshiba NB205 Netbook (running Windows XP). Without an optial drive, backups to external media or installing new software can be bothersome.  This solves that problem and, in addition, allows me to play movies without having to store the file(s) on the hard drive.  Installation was pretty much a brease, except that the computer stated there was an error on installation and that the unit might not work as expected.  I have not had any difficulty so far.  I have watched DVD's from the Buffalo and copied a rather large file to a DVD+R without a problem.  I have not needed to use the boost cord (the other USB connection) on the Toshiba NB205.  Another reviewed stated that the Buffalo is noisy.  I did not find this to be the case (unless you're copying files from the Buffalo to the Hard Drive, in which case it does hum due to the speed).  It isn't any noisier than any other DVD.  It will hum while it spins up to load the inserted disk, but, after that, there isn't any noise.  I watched a movie with it and the Buffalo was quiet.  It was also stated in another review that there was a difficulty with ejecting DVDs.  The only time I found this to be the case was when the Buffalo was running while finishing up an operation.  That is to be expected.  When the Buffalo is finished, push the button and the DVD pops out.  The cable storage is fantastic!  The cables wrap around the enclosure in specifically provided slots and the plugs snuggle neatly into their own little resting places.  The cables are labeled - one is the normal USB, the other is labeled \\\\\"Boost\\\\\" in case computer USB slot doesn't have enough power to run the Buffalo.  Again, I didn't have to use this on the NB205.  The \\\\\"Boost\\\\\" cable is not long enough to wrap around to the other side of the computer, so, if there aren't two USB outlets on the same side, some sort of extension will need to be provided (that's mentioned in another review).(Actually, I think I can get one plug on one side of my Netbook and one on the other, but it's a bit of a stretch and the Buffalo would be just about in my lap).  One thing I would like to see is better non-skid feet.  The Buffalo actually slid off the table while I was recording (I bumped it with the keyboard drawer for the other computer - I have one computer for each hand).  I installed peel and stick feet (called Heavy Duty Bumpers at KMart in the Home Improvement section) and the Buffalo doesn't slide around any more  It's also a little easier to get the drawer closed with one hand (I think someone complained about that).  The software provided is not real great.  It's Cyberlink's Power2Go 7 DE version, which has limited capabilities.  Even when burning a disk, options such as buffer underrun protection, data verification, and burning speed are not selectable.  Cyberlink gives the user several opportunities to upgrade to a better version.  I did not find the software very intuitive.  I have used many burning packages before.  I tried a test burn with this one and did not succeed in copying a large file to a DVD.  Another small thing I hated was that the window for Cyberlink adjusted itself to the full screen width of my netbook.  I placed the task bar over on the left to make more room on the screen vertically.  This hides the right portion of the Cyberlink window.  This can not be adjusted (from what I have seen).  However, the purpose of this is not to review the software.  I just want to make the reader aware of what I experienced.  I decided to uninstall Cyberlink and use another package (try CDBurnerXP).  BUT, do not let my impression of the software deter you from acquiring the Buffalo.  One might also question the brand name.  Who ever heard of \\\\\"Buffalo\\\\\" (unless you live in or pass through upper New York State)?  Well, I have been involved with computer software and hardware since the 1980's and have used Buffalo products before.  They've been around for a while.  Bottom line is this is a good unit (so far, anyway).  If you're in the market for this type of hardware, this is good!",

I was suitably impressed the first time I used them: full range sound (including some bass from some bass tubes on the back of the speakers) that was clear. The cords are long enough, and you can peel the USB and 3.5mm cords apart as far as you need to reach the necessary ports (like if you have the headphone jack on the opposite side of the computer from the USB ports, like my 15.6&#34; laptop).<br /><br />I was looking for speakers that were USB powered so I could use them away from a wall socket (just plug them into the netbook for power). This also gives me flexibility as I can use my external battery bank back-up (that I have with me to charge my phone) to power these speakers and then plug the input into my phone or iPod to play music/movies wherever I go.

No fuss routers that do their jobs well are the ones I like the best.<br /><br />This has been my experience with the Rangebooster so far:<br /><br />Installation was a bit bumpy. While everything was connected right the first time, it took a couple power cycles of my PC, cable modem, router, and the VOIP modem to get everything to \\\\\"play well together.\\\\\" Once all the hardware synced properly, it was smooth sailing. All the other computers quickly recognized the new connection with minimal or no help from me. The only exception was the laptop and Tivo. The laptop gave me a \\\\\"certificate\\\\\" error that I had to fix and Tivo just needed to be directed to the new connection and new password.<br />Both issues were resolved quickly.<br /><br />At present, I have 3 PCs and a VOIP modem cabled to the router. On the wi-fi side I have an older laptop, a Series 2 Tivo, and a Wii. So far they are all playing nicely together for several days now. No problems or hiccups found. The QoS for my VOIP is excellent and it is installed \\\\\"behind\\\\\" the router.<br /><br />Once all were up and running properly I installed Network Magic, the included software program on D-Link's installation CD. It's optional, but out of curiousity I wanted to check it out. Wow! So glad I did! This little program made setting up wireless security and other adjustments on the D-Link Rangebooster SO EASY! It also keeps me updated on the network's state of affairs and alerts me if it finds any problems. Nice! Network Magic is a gem of a program and I gladly recommend everyone to at least try it. I'm glad D-Link included it with their router package. (The basic version is free, the upgraded version cost extra.)<br /><br />The real bummer I realize after I got the router is that I needed to also get the N-adapter to truly take advantage of the \\\\\"N\\\\\" goodies available on this router.

The first time this happened, the iPad was so warm to the touch I thought I fried it! The next time it happened - I had to power off the iPad completely. My son thinks its the key directly below the iPad's home button that is causing the issue. I haven't tested this long enough to verify it but I'm not going to compromise my iPad. I used the iPad everyday and want it to be 100% so for now I just detached the keyboard.",

The keys got stuck on one, stopped working all together on another, and the 4 on the last one entered 8's when pressed. Total junk. Unfortunately, there are not many brands that make these wireless so we have corded ones that are a hassle but at least they work!",
