    "Definition": "In this task, you need to reverse all words of a given length in the sentence. The number of letters in a word determine its length. For example, the length of the word \"apple\" is 5.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sentence: 'as a guy jumps over the snow with his snowboard people riding on the lift behind him look on'. Reverse all words of length '6' in the given sentence.",
            "output": "as a guy jumps over the snow with his snowboard elpoep gnidir on the lift dniheb him look on",
            "explanation": "Words 'people', 'riding', 'behind' are of length 6. Reversing these words results in 'elpoep', 'gnidir', and 'dniheb' respectively. So this is a correct answer."

            "explanation": "The word 'snowy' is of length 5. Reverse of 'snowy' is 'ywons', So, the answer is correct."

            "output": "people era flying kites on the beach on a hazy day",
            "explanation": "The word 'a' is length 1 and reverse of it 'a'. In the output, the word 'are' is reversed even though it is of length 3. So, the answer should have been 'people are flying kites on the beach on a hazy day'."

            "explanation": "You should not reverse the order of the specified words. You should keep them in their order in the sentence and reverse the order of their letters."
