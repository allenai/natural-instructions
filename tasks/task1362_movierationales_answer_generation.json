it 's kruger 's \" style \" , not the director 's that winds up on screen .\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" .\nand his numerous twists ca n't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd 's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan\nj .\npakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they should n't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" .\n. .\ngrammar be damned ) .\n\"\nhow did you know that ?\n\" the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . . . since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger 's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it 's no wonder why he works so frequently .\nhe 's quickly becoming miramax 's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr .\nvehicles .\ntheir company 's current logo could be\n\"\nwe ride the trends \" . reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it 's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone 's bitch .\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting .\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who 's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) james frain is nick , rudy 's cellmate , a manslaughterer who 's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she 's never seen one picture of him .\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near - riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley 's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co - horts .\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i 've described might as well be irrelevant .\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack\na stupid one - liner .\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .\nthough it 's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a - list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin\n( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr .\nmorneau ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make - up and a not so flattering moo - moo ) , and now this .\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain - zapped mtv audience to pick apart .\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes )\nserve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol\n( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance\n( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .",

bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit - picky ,\nbut hey , i was on a roll .\nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he 's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .\nhank azaria does what he can , but do n't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .\nlike broderick 's , azaria 's character is quite simply lacking in color .\nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .\ncasting must have been asleep on this one .\nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we 've seem him do in the past .\nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable .\nunfortunately , the same can not be said of the other incongruities .\nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue - in - cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .\nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .\nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .\nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? if we ca n't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply do n't care what happens to them .\ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light -

collar job , is sexually inadequate , and can not communicate with his family about his feelings .\nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .\nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .\nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .\nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .\nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct .\nand you got the feeling that these crass people could n't act like this all the time .\nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .\nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .\nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .\neven the best effects ca n't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .\nnow that i think about it ,\nthe worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make .\npeople will be lined up around the block for it .\nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 .\neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he 'll play every character in the movie .\ni just ca n't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .",

disaster to be released the beginning of july .\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante 's peak .\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . to be completely honest , i have n't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .\ndeep impact does n't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover - up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .\nand so , yada yada yada\n, they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival .\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wo n't kill off the entire human race .\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer -- approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .\nit 's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wo n't work .\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er .\n\" her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .\nsuggestion to ms .\nleder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off\n.\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real - time --\nit 's that boring\n.\nof course , leder is n't all to blame for it .\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .\nchock full of cheesy one liners\n( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) and\nstupid characters\n, you might think we were back in the 70s again .\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring\n.\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you ca n't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci - fi .\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .\nthat 's right , 80 % miss , and 20 % hit .\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that 's forgiveable .\nwhat is n't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .\ngive me a break , will ya ?\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks\n.\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .\njust when we think visual effects ca n't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder 's direction , which also influences the actors .\nleder loves to show the actors ' faces before and during moments of terror .\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .\nleder likes to flaunt people 's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space .\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person 's face while drifting into space .\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .\non another note , leder 's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it 's obvious it will be emotional .\nit 's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it did n't work for me .\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .\nt ?\na leoni ( bad boys , tv 's \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .\nher character is made stronger by leoni 's presence , and we grow to care for her .\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still has n't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) .\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv 's \" star trek : the next generation .\n\" seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .\nluckily , the x - files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .\nit 's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just is n't worth much .\ncosting nearly $ 75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar - winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .\nwell , it 's not .\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .",

these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there 's a catch -- he 's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who 's now infected with alien dna .\npatrick 's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring .\nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half - human , half - alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick 's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr .\nlaura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction .\nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey - looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around .\nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b - movie is quickly answered .\nmr .\nbrancato 's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there 's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker 's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here .\n\"\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful .\n\"\nand she 's not even empathic !\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully - paced suspense sequence , eve , who 's telepathically linked to her alien / human - hybrid counterpart\n( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien - hunting protagonists , \" he 's going to rape her .\n\" while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .\nthere 's an amusing , tongue - in - cheek bit of product placement ( which does n't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket - related hijinx ( \" he 's in aisle 1 !\n\" informs eve ) .\nif the film maintained this sort of light - hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects - ladened anticlimactic conclusion .\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it 's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve 's brain ?\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?\nmy favourite was the slow - motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it 's being foisted upon the public .\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms .\nhelgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay ,\nbut there 's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble )\nchurns out an all - too - familiar spin on a generic brash - mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick 's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .\nmr .\nlazard gives his character an appropriately shifty - eyed look , while returning vixen ms .\nhenstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .\nms .\nhenstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she 's so empowered .\n\"\na lethal half - alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion\n-- now * that 's\n* what i call empowerment .",

and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain .\n\"\nthe jackal \" tries to mix both elements .\nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad .\n\"\nthe jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i 've yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule .\nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi .\n. .\nor is he ?\nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he 'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion .\nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people .\nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier -\nyes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex - ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of ' 97 ) who 's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever .\nsoon , he 's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him .\nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on .\nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue\n.\nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register .\nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one .\nit does n't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances .\nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it ca n't decide what it wants to focus on\n.\nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ?\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who 's in everything for the money ?\nor is it a combination of both ?\n\" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character .\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast .\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then .\nthe supporting characters are worse .\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable .\nwhat is poitier doing here ?\nhe 's one of the best living actors !\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ?\ndiane venora 's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade .\nit 's not that anyone 's bad here ; it 's that they have nothing to do .\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post - production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time .\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain .\nthere are several times where he 's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill .\ntake a scene where he 's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it .\ndoes n't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?\nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ?\ngeez !\nis there anything good here ?\nwell .\n. .\na couple things .\ni did like willis 's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle .\nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have .\nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis .\nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they 're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity\nthat is \" the jackal .\n\"\ndirector michael caton - jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro - clancy kinda way .\nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong .",

august dumping ground .\nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .\nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .\nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .\nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .\nthe film i saw today did n't even meet those expectations .\nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess .\ni would slam it harder , if it were n't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors .\nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .\nthat 's the main problem with the avengers : for all it 's hip - hop flash and tidal waves ,\nnone of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .\nit 's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .\nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .\nthis is just plain depressing .\nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .\nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i 've never watched an episode .\ni was n't alive then .\ni do n't even watch television now .\ni 'm very sorry that i do n't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i 've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .\ni did n't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .\ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .\nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr .\npeel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .\nthey are to work together , under mother 's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co - conspirator , father , is played by the equally - talented fiona shaw ) .\nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .\nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) .\nhe is a crazy scottish guy .\nour heroes had better stop him , or else . . .\nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film 's few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense\n.\nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .\nnow , killer bugs do n't really go with the weather - controlling theme of the film .\nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .\nthey 're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they 're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .\nthe special effects are n't bad , but they 're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .\nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .\nand i guarantee you ,\nit will wane .\ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it did n't do any good to think .\nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re - assembled so many times that even the people involved could n't tell us what happens .\nthere are several scenes in the preview that did n't make the final cut .\nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low - budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .\nthe scenes that do n't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .\nthey are n't .\nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film .\nthey are n't , either .\nand what about this\nwasted cast ?\noh , it makes me weep with disappointment .\nwe 're talking ralph fiennes here ,\none of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .\ni love the guy .\ni 've loved all his films , until this one .\nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he 's as lost as we are .\nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , ca n't manage to look at home here .\n( i do n't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it ca n't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )\nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .\nwho is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?\nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .\nis it the actors ?\nfor god 's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .\ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who should n't have been given the task to begin with .\nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .\nadd to that a lack of experience in big - budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .\nif the avengers has a saving grace , it 's the set design .\nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .\ni like the final set - piece , on de wynter 's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .\ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr .\npeel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .\ni also enjoyed michael kamen 's music score , particularly in the opening credits .\nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but\nthere 's a lot more that needs to be here .\ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .\nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose .\nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .\ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance .",

while bruno may have studied under cameron 's wing for years and years , i 'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ;\nthe fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z - grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z - grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .\nthe film seems to not only borrow it 's plot from last year 's similarly - fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b - movie from the ' 80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter 's twisted remake of \" the thing .\n\" \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .\nthey get on .\nthey break up into pairs and investigate .\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond - ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential - romantic - interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .\nand it 's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus - side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just do n't give a damn .\ni almost do n't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub - par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he 's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance - of - which - he - should - be - ashamed\n.\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo 'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .\nor peter o'toole in \" caligula .\n\" great actor , horrific performance .\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland 's career that\nno one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone 's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar - nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it 's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . .\nif , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .\n\" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it 's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable .\n\"\nand if you do n't believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there 's even one shot where we see godzilla\neither a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him\n( well , you do n't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) .\nbut all of this does n't matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie .\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i 've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean - extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure could n't figure it out when i saw it ) .\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that 's basically the whole of \" virus \" :\none horribly - directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget\nthat saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members .\nand my god , it 's a long damn sit .\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it 's a wonder that it even got made .\nwe already know that big movie studios ' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool .\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light .\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face .\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i 'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr .\nbruno for making a movie that could be this bad .\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" are not only justifiable , but encouraged .",

ish .\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history .\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series .\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non - ape - speaking .\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .\nbut serling never tackles the all - important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith 's best if not his best .\nwhen the film 's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well - intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton 's new version is even less faithful .\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world 's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard - of - oz - fashion and drops him on an alien planet .\n( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .\nand the language they talk is earth- english .\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently did n't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human - animal relationships and more one of the master - slave relationships .\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .\nshe is bent on making the world a better place .\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil - ari .\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material .\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each 's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .\nwe can not see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i did n't like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup .\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 .\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw - dropper .\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker 's visualization is really an improvement .\nthese visuals work nicely .\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .\napes spring incredible distances .\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air\nthe effect is lost .\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close - up . since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make - up .\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .\nbut he delivers them very well .\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .\nas the ape - trader limbo he over - emotes to overcome his ape make - up , but does it very well .\nin doing\nso he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov 's performance in spartacus .\nas an in - joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .\ndanny elfman 's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith 's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .",

year - old boy is autistic .\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it .\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him .\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising .\n\"\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon 's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost .\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he 's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people .\nit 's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he is n't playing like he 's autistic .\nunlike dustin hoffman 's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio 's in \" what 's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting .\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character 's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .\nhell , he does n't even have to be shy .\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis ' arm .\nwillis ' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon 's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .\nof course , we know that is n't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square - jawed government hitman with a mean - looking crew - cut knock off the parents .\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked .\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon .\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon 's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes .\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop .\nof all the hard - to - believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst .\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey 's character is far too accommodating .\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" does n't rise to the challenge .\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and\n3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were .\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it 's more suspenseful that way .\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor .\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious .\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts .\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it 's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .",

her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh - from - jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions .\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always - woozy rubell ( myers , in a well - modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers ' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club 's famously hard - ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow 's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug - crazed granny , but she 's a peripheral character at best ) . as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _ dancing _ in _\n54 _ .\nwhat is a disco film -- especially one about the pinnacle of the movement -- without the dancing ?\neven whit stillman 's _ the_last_days_of_disco _ , which was n't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip - to - only - themselves club - hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .\ndancing is n't the only thing glazed over in _ 54_--so\nis the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher 's fault .\nfrom what i 've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 's legend .\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane 's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness ,\nan idealistic do - gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .\nthis tacked - on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .\nthey fail on both counts .\nultimately , _ 54\n_ 's failure comes down to three letters : f - u - n . as in , there is n't any to be had for the audience .\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment does n't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film 's conclusion\n( one of the last - minute reshoots ) . strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there -- two of them , in fact --\nbut _ 54 _ is not one of them .\nthey 're on cable tv :\na couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings - on within it show that there 's still a great disco movie to be made .\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _ 54 _ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .",

joey ( kevin\nj .\no'connor ) , the inept sidekick who 's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .\ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes .\nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .\naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there 's no one on board .\nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .\nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad 's cinque ) .\nwilliams , once a \" ca n't miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor\nthat the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .\nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .\ngiven her limited acting abilities , it 's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .\nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture .\nmeanwhile , kevin j .\no'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .\nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects .\nthis is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn .\nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .\nnow , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it 's impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins .\nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .\nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here is n't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre\n( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .\neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it wo n't be the last of its kind .\nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush .\nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .",

protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others .\n\"\n54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that 's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .\nthis is a definite plus .\nhere 's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let 's look at how it all affected the people .\nbut this film does n't let that happen .\nit gives us a half -

too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who 've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he 's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .\nit 's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .\nthe studio 's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film 's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini 's \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i did n't particularly want to stay .",

boiled tarantino - esque dialogue .\nthey evince little chemistry , with rock\nconstantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that 's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) .\ni think rock is a great comic\nyet he has n't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it 's like he 's doing the damn chris rock show .\nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks .\nthat wide -

theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle .\nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie 's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it 's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing\n.\nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if\nit falls as flat as diet coke .\nbetty 's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty would n't make any progress in the film .\nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim 's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim 's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ?\na little too tidy , don'tcha think .\nbetty has an interesting theme , though it does n't even seem aware of this .\nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way .\nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real - life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) .\ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the ' 80s than the ' 00s ) , the film simply uses betty 's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b .\nno progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .",

they assume the audience wo n't get what 's going on , so they explain everything five times over .\nfourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i 'm just here to get a paycheck \" attitude .\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .\narmin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . and sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world .\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going .\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .\nsupposedly we 're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .\nme , i alternated between the two .\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars\n\" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .",

            "input": "in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super - rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says .\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .\ni liked that scene for two reasons .\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool .\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .\nmeet joe black is chock - full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot\n.\nit 's easy to watch meet\njoe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani ,\nbut it 's even easier to sleep right through it\n( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .\n( it 's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )\nit should n't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr .\npitt .\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing - room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see\nmeet joe black immediately .\nanyway , the deceased lawyer 's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .\nif this were n't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is ,\nwe get scene after scene of fish - out - of - water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who 's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and does n't know how to act in our society .\nit also does n't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .\nand as played by brad pitt , he 's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing\n, he 's just there .\nit 's as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty .\n\"\nit 's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .\ni 've used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt 's performance with this year 's best angel performance , nicolas cage 's in city of angels .\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co - star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani 's character is so shallow that she ca n't see beyond pitt 's good looks .\nthe movie 's other top name is a much better actor , but that does n't save meet joe black .\nsir anthony hopkins is n't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .\nhe plays one of these good - hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .\n( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins 's character more realistically evil . )\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i 'm sure .\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i 'm asking myself why .\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i 'm going to do now .\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .\ndo n't go see\nmeet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .\n-- curtis edmonds \" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .\n\"\n-- sideshow bob",
