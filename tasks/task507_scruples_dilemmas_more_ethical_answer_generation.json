	],
	"Definition": "Given an action statement, generate another action statement which is more ethical, that is, morally less wrong.",
	"Positive Examples": [
		{
			"input": "calling my mother a bitch during her birthday party",
			"output": "starting a fight over pizza",
			"explanation": "Saying inappropriate things to one's mother on her special occasion is very rude. On the other hand, starting a fight over pizza often happens among friends and most of the time harmless. So the answer is much more ethical than the given action."
		},
		{
			"input": "taking my son's PS4 he bought himself",
			"output": "not knowing anything about computers",
			"explanation": "taking son's object which he bought himself with his own money is insensitive and might hurt his feelings. On the other hand, not knowing something can be dealt with by learning further and does not harm others in any ways. So the answer is more ethical than the given action"
		}
	],
	"Negative Examples": [
		{
			"input": "being angry at some one canceling last minute",
			"output": "quitting a volunteer position after completing the training",
			"explanation": "Quiting a position after completing the training process may hurt the organization who have trained the person. On the other hand, there is quite logical to be angry at someone who cancel plans at the last minitue. So the answer is less ethical than the given action."
		},
		{
			"input": "telling my friends sister that she probably won't get a celebrity to go to prom with her",
			"output": "breaking off a \"friendship\" and leaving it as business only",
			"explanation": "Both the actions are morally wrong and one cannot be differentiated from the other as morally less wrong"
		}
