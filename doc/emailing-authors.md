## Emailing authors of existing crowdsourced datasets 

If you're the author of the dataset, you can skip this step.
You can [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical+turk+site:https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS865US865&sxsrf=ALeKk03WhDB5Er1VDn8xkZkQ19xnwCRUdg:1612731653696&source=lnt&tbs=qdr:y&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6lNjK1djuAhXiJTQIHZpFBHYQpwV6BAgVECQ&biw=1929&bih=1018) for recently published papers that used crowdsourcing and ask the authors for their templates.  
If you're emailing the authors, you can use an email like this:
```
Hi <...>,
Hope you're doing well! 

My name is <...> and I am one of the contributors to the natural instructions project.  
I am interested in incorporating your the crowdsourcing template that you used in your paper: <...>. 
We think your instructions are a good addition to the benchmark since <...>.  
We were wondering if you can share your mechanical turk templates (e.g., the html files) and the corresponding input/outputs to each of the MTurk experiments (csv files in batches).
 
Thank you, 
<...>
```
