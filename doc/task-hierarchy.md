# Task Hierarchy

## Guidelines / FAQs for Contributors:

- Massaging the task hierarchy categories is somewhat encouraged.
- If a subcategory (e.g. `Question Answering -> Contextual Question Answering -> Extractive`) is mentioned, don't mention its parent category (`Question Answering -> Contextual Question Answering`)
- `src/auto_add_domain.py` is helpful for adding domains for all tasks in any particular dataset
## Task Categories   
- `Classification`
  - `Classification -> Answer Type Classification`: Classify a text that contains a question to the type of answer that is expected (e.g., multiple choice, extractive, abstractive etc.) 
  - `Classification -> Intent Classification`: Classify a text to a pre-defined set of intent classes  
  - `Classification -> Pairwise Classification`: Classify a pair of text sequences to a target class
  - `Classification -> Topic Classification`
  - `Classification -> Verification`: Verification is a sub-category for classification and it is used for binary classifications. The task is to verify whether a given descriptive attribute applies to a given text or not (binary output) e.g. if the paragraph contains offensive content or not. In the verification tasks, the potential outputs are mentioned in the definition.
