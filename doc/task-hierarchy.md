# Task Hierarchy

## Guidelines / FAQs for Contributors:

- Massaging the task hierarchy categories is somewhat encouraged.
- If a subcategory (e.g. `Question Answering -> Contextual Question Answering -> Extractive`) is mentioned, don't mention its parent category (`Question Answering -> Contextual Question Answering`)
- `src/auto_add_domain.py` is helpful for adding domains for all tasks in any particular dataset
