  "Definition": "The input is a sentence and an EMOTION_CATEGORY along with the GENDER of the person. The structure of the sentence contains NOUN / NAME OF PERSON and EMOTION_WORD. From the given sentence, emotion and the gender, the main goal is to find the RACE of the individual in the sentence (AFRICAN-AMERICAN / EUROPEAN/UNKNOWN) from a given sentence.\nImportant points: A) NAME / NOUN can play a major role in identifying the RACE of an individual so, it can be provided a 60% weightage. B) GENDER can be provided a weightage of 30%. C) EMOTION can be provided a weightage of 10%. D) The RACE should be one of the above 3 races mentioned.",
  "Positive Examples": [
    {
      "input": "SENTENCE: Alphonse feels happy. \n EMOTION: joy \n GENDER: male",
      "output": "African-American",
      "explanation": "The answer is correct. The name of the person is \"Alphonse\" which could very well be an \"African-American\" influence. The emotion of \"joy\" can have a small weightage and a link with the EMOTION WORD in the sentence that is \"happy\". Also, the gender is male which in relation with the name can provide further insight into the race."
    },
    {
      "input": "SENTENCE: Shaniqua feels scared. \n EMOTION: fear \n GENDER: female",
      "output": "African-American",
      "explanation": "The answer is correct. The name of the person is \"Shaniqua\" which could very well be an \"African-American\" influence. The gender being \"female\"\\ can have a link with the name and hence the race. The emotion of \"fear\" can have a small weightage and a link with the EMOTION WORD in the sentence that is \"scared\""
    },
    {
      "input": "SENTENCE: Ryan feels irritated. \n EMOTION: anger \n GENDER: male",
      "output": "European",
      "explanation": "The answer is correct. The name of the person is \"Ryan\" which could very well be a \"European\" influence. The emotion of \"anger\" can have a small weightage and a link with the EMOTION WORD in the sentence that is \"irritated\". Also, the gender weightage to Ryan can make the race more obvious."

      "input": "SENTENCE: This man feels happy. \n EMOTION: joy \n GENDER: male",
      "output": "Unknown",
      "explanation": "The answer is correct. The name of the person is not provided. Therefore creating ambuigity in detecting the race of the individual."

      "explanation": "The prediction is wrong. There is no mention of a name. This creates ambiguity and hence the answer is Other"

    {
      "input": "SENTENCE: 'I made Adam feel terrified. \n EMOTION: fear \n GENDER: male",
      "output": "Unknown",
      "explanation": "The prediction is wrong. The correct answer is European. The name of the person has been mentioned clearly. This gives an initial idea about the race. Further, providing the gender of the person along with the emotion gives a better idea about the race of the individual."

    {
      "input": "SENTENCE: 'Tia made me feel excited. \n EMOTION: joy \n GENDER: female",
      "output": "European",
      "explanation": "The prediction is wrong. The correct answer is African-American. A noun is clear here \"Tia\". Though this could a European name, it is more inclined to an African-American name due to the influential factors of the gender and a small weightage provided to emotion."
