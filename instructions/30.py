def create_sentence_pair_answer(context_word: str) -> str:
    """
    Given a context word, the task is to create pair of sentences. The sentence pair should contain blank and the answer for that blank should be generated. The sentence pair should a) look similar b) be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). The sentence pairs should have different trigger words i.e, words which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentences should be PersonX and PersonY respectively. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word but, instead depend on the context present in the sentence. Answers should not be ambiguous. The sentence pairs should not have potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. The sentence pairs should not use animals and proper nouns as objects. There should be diversity in the sentence pair. The sentence pair should contain at least 15 and at max 30 words. The sentence pairs should have at least 70% overlapping words. There should only one blank in each of the sentence. TMake sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.

    Parameters:
        context_word (str): context_word

    Returns:
        str: two sentences and answer for them
