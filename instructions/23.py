def generate_common_sense_question_from_context(context: str) -> str:
    """
    Given a context, generate a common-sense question. The question should be long, interesting, and, complex. The question generated should be easy for humans to answer but, difficult for AI machines. To create such questions, some possible suggestions are:

    A. What may (or may not) be the plausible reason for an event?
    B. What may (or may not) happen before (or after, or during) an event?
    C. What may (or may not) be a plausible fact about someone (or something)?
    D. What may (or may not) happen if an event happens (or did not happen)?

    The question should not be answerable without looking at the context. The answer to the question should not be directly extractable from the context. The question should not require for specialized knowledge to be answerable. The questions should not be simple and short. The question must be related to the context and answerable with common sense.

    Parameters:
        context (str): a given context

    Returns:
        str: question
