    Given a sentence and a question, generate an incorrect answer based on the question and the sentence. The incorrect answer has to be a text span from the given sentence. The correct answer will require the understanding of coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities.

    Parameters:
        sentence (str): a given sentence
        question (str): a given question
