def alter_question(question: str) -> str:
    """
    Given a question, alter the meaning of the question to have a different answer by changing as few words as possible. The answer type should be retained in the altered question (i.e., if the given question has a yes/no answer, so should yours, etc.). The questions are in three domains: a) presidents, b) national parks, and c) dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. During altering the question, the keyword should also be used the same way. Leave the original sentence the same as much as possible, changing only the meaning of the question. Try to write specific questions that are not too easy. Do not write open-ended or subjective questions (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.). The question should be specific and concrete.

    Parameters:
        question (str): a given question

    Returns:
        str: altered question with different answer
