def generate_incorrect_answer_to_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Question asks how to do a certain task. Answer should describe a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome, yet it is closely related to it (i.e., it should use the words that are provided in the input). The physical process can be moving something, arranging something in a certain way, mixing things, shaking them, etc. To make sure that the generated process does not lead to the asked outcome, answer can introduce objects or events unrelated to the context of the question e.g. 'cleaning the keyboard by making an elephant sit on them'; or it can create contradictory statements e.g. 'drying wet keyboards with running water'. Do not include avoid typos and misspellings.

    Parameters:
        question: question to be answered incorrectly

    Returns:
        str: incorrect answer that does not lead to phystical outcome asked in question
